We have found the three bedroom condos to be spacious, clean and very comfortable. They units though very nice are beginning to show some age as the tv's are old and not a lot of choices for stations. They now have added free WiFi which is a bonus. The room rates are in the top 90% for affordability. Every year we check rates and find that WorldQuest Resort has the best price hands down. My family and I though we do travel to the local Disney parks find WorldQuest so appealing is because the pool area is not over crowded during the day. We love just to relax by the pool and take in the warm weather. The pool area is large and our favorite place to hang out. However, we have noticed each year that we return the pool does not seem to be as well kept as it use to be. The management staff should pay closer attention to having the pool cleaned more often and the paint is chipping all around the edges. For a family who comes to Florida from New Hampshire where it is cold, we want a nice pool that is clean. Our first night we were put in a condo unit on the ground floor. For the first time we witnessed three very large mice running near our screened porch and one was outside our front door. That was very unsettling for my wife and daughters and requested a move. To the staff's credit, they moved us. The management needs to address the mice problem on the grounds as we were not the only guests who noticed. Mice were seen running around the pool area on several ocassions. Don't get me wrong, my family and I would recommend this resort to anyone and we would not hesitate to return. We will pay close attention to the pool area and mice issues next year. We believe WorldQuest Resort deserves the chance to address these problems and correct them before we decide not to return.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice Vacation\u201d", "Author": "RedirectedNLife", "ReviewID": "UR128617201", "Content": "My family and I stayed at the Worldquest Resort on April 15-20th. Our family was composed of me, my husband, and my two sons, ages 2 and 9. I really appreciated the security guards that were in place. It did make me feel a little safer for them to actually have to check my name off of an incoming guests list, to make sure that I was supposed to be there. The grounds and complex are beautiful. We had a two bedroom and two bath suite. It was more than enough room for the 4 of us. We stayed in building 7, with a view of the lake. All of the tvs were flat screens. The screened in patio was very nice with ample space to move around. My only complaint was the amount of hair that was in our suite. It was very evident that the floors had not been swept or vacuumed in a while. When our sheets were pulled back, there were strands of long black hair them. I called the front desk and told them that I had hair on my sheets, and asked them for more. Approximately 30-45 minutes later, the security guard brought more sheets to me. There were also strands of hair on the floor of the bathroom, on the walls of the shower, and on a few towels . Perhaps the person that cleaned was in a hurry and took some shortcuts? Anyway, the next morning, I swept and vacuumed the floors, washed the sheets, and washed the towels. Once we got past this issue, everything else was very nice. We did not partake of the breakfast. We elected to make breakfast in the suite each day. The kitchen utensils were quite adequate. We did not elect for housekeeping during our stay, but they did pick up the trash daily. Even though I had read about how close the hotel was from Disney, I was still surprised when we got there so fast. We were also one exit away from Downtown Disney. All in all, this is a very nice place. There were just a few minor issues that could have easily been fixed. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCentral Hotel with great facilities\u201d", "Author": "Ceirion P", "ReviewID": "UR128578954", "Content": "Having been to Orlando a couple of time we thought we would try Worldquest resort.

Yes some of the paintwork could of been refreshed and the TV's were not flat screen but had cable, but this was not an issue at all. The resort itself was a great size, not to big as some can be and the pool was lovely with a hot spa outside. The staff were all very friendly and as it was off all the main roads was nice and quiet. The free breakfast buffet was a pleasant start of the day, it was a cold buffet and included, fruit, cakes, toast, bagals and cereals with tea and coffee, although some guest did like to take advantage of this and were leaving with boxes full of stuff, I guess you always get them. There is a lack of a restaurant although there was a pool bar which sold snacks and the shop is very limited but with the location being so close to everything shops were close by.

It was a great stay, couldn't complain. We got a 3 bedroom, and it was really roomy and well appointed. The beds are somewhat soft for our taste, but comfy nonetheless. The kitchen comes complete with utensils, plates and pans. It's really like coming home, except tidier, ha! The master bathroom with jetted tub is awesome, and our kids really love taking turns in it. Having a washer and dryer is really convenient, we only had to pack half of what we would have if we didn't have a washer and dryer. The units are air conditioned, and the patio is completely covered by bug screens, so we can leave the patio door open anytime we're in the unit and it's not too hot out, instead of turning on the AC. They charge a per-day resort fee and end-of-stay fee, which, as far as I know, is standard for resort type accommodations. They also gave 4 different options to have daily cleaning, from just removing the trash for no charge, to a complete hotel-like service for about $40 a day. Pretty expensive for a full service, but we went for a middle-of-the-road option. Parking is plenty and free. Wireless internet is pretty fast and reliable, didn't have any dropped connection while we were there. They have free breakfast, and it was great. The food is great, although not too varied. Bread, bagels, muffins, cinnamon rolls, apples, oranges, coffee, juices. But they always quick to restock whenever any of the food runs out (except for the fruits which they seem to sometime run out of, but rarely). Breakfast runs from 6:30 to 9:30, and even though you get there at 9:29, they'd still have food for you.

The negatives were minor ones really and did not detract from the holiday. We do make use of the kitchen and therefore the equipment side is important to us. The actual facilities (cooker, oven, fridge etc) were fine and of the same standard as experienced elsewhere. The actual cooking utensils and similar items were not so great and there were some items like serving spoons that were simply not there. However if all you want are the very basics to heat up and serve prepared stuff and so on it is fine. We had a 3 bedroomed apartment for the extra space although we only needed two bedrooms for the extra space which worked well and we were at the far end of the resort which was generally very quiet and worked well for us. We had the full service option which was fine, on reflection we probably could have reduced the days we had this and saved a few dollars but the fact there are options is good. We thought the pool area was nice and well maintained and I have to say all the staff we dealt with were very helpful and responded to requests in a positive fashion, it had a much more laid back feel than similar places we have been to. There was a maintenance problem with a toilet that took two visits to fix but in fairness the response was prompt on both instances. As mentioned there were some items missing from the kitchen but these were speedily attended to. The wi fi worked great and again a minor gripe was having to buy business centre time to simply do an online check in and print boarding cards when many hotels offer this service for free as a customer service perk now. Great location for the Disney Parks and well located for the shopping outlets and easy route to Orlando International Airport, but a car is essential as nothing else is really close by. There are some similar properties at the southern end of I drive where the Lynx and I trolley just provides another option rather than driving. If it just had the I trolley/Lynx connection as well that would be really great.

For practically half the price of Disney resorts, you can get a spacious, 1200 sq. ft. condo (2 bdr/ 2 bath) with a full kitchen. Whether you're a budget traveler or not, this resort maintains a high standard for quality. Here are the main advantages: * Great price compared to Disney resorts: value, value, value. * Just a 10-minute car ride to the Disney theme parks. * Daily continental breakfast (bagels, muffins, cereal, juice, coffee, tea) * Close to Publix and WalMart for all of your grocery/ misc needs * Heated swimming pool for some great down time away from Disney (although it wasn't heated enough...still a little chilly) Be aware that daily housekeeping is extra. They will empty out your garbage though everyday. Also, just an FYI: the TVs are not flat screen. That was the only thing that was not updated. Tips: * If being close to the pool is important to you, stay in bldg 1 or 2. Be warned, however, that if you do stay in either bldg, it might get a little noisy esp when it's hot and everyone is lounging around the pool. * If you will be cooking in the kitchen, then you will definitely need to bring a few extra items. See the picture of the kitchen inventory. Some of the things that you may want to bring are a good chef's knife, a 12\" skillet, and kitchen shears.

Biggest upside(s) are the size of the accomodations and general air of luxury. Biggest downside (for me) was proximity to a busy highway whose noise put a big dent in the enjoyment of the screened deck.Be sure to try to secure a space that faces interior of the property. Buildings are beautifully archetected in a Mediterrranian style, with exceptionally high ceilings that add to the feeling space. Apartment (mine was a 3-bedroom, 2-bath) was spotlessly clean, and grounds are meticulously maintained. Overall cost (net of two bar drinks) came to $170 per night all-in, which was reasonable for the space this time of year. Swimming pool is large and elegant, with plenty of lounge chairs and shade umbrellas. Water too cold for my taste, but adjoining hot tub was just right. Pool-side bar is pricey, though. Small details worth considering: A vent port above the master bedroom door transmits both sound and light from the adjoining living room. For some, this could raise a comfort and privacy concern. Also, there's no closet in the master bedroom--the closet is in the incredibly large bathroom. Bedroom could use a more commodious dresser. Also, be warned that the apartments are cleaned so completely that you'll need to bring certain essentials, most notably paper towels, coffee-maker filters (flat basket type), laundry soap and dishwash detergent. Wouldn't hurt to bring your own bath soap and shampoo either. Although the web site brags about their onsite convenience store, they didn't have anything I needed (realy it's just a tiny commissary). Shopping is a two-mile drive away, at least. Biggest location advantage is proximity to Disney World (without having to pay the freight of a Disney hotel). Note though that while disney world property is less than three miles away, actually getting to a parking space is a good half hour trip from your start at Worldquest, and getting into the park is another half hour after that. Plan accordingly. (Universal is about 25 minutes away, plus the usual entrance delays.)

The rooms were lovely and spacious. 2. Well decorated 3. Felt as if you were in an apartment or condo 4. The kitchen was well stocked if you had a desire to cook or have meals without going out. 5. The pool area was nice. 6. A gated property where your parking tag as displayed to enter and exit the facility 7. Breakfast was provided. 8. Excellent proximity to the parks 9.

I called upon landing at 10:30 and was told to call again at 2:00. I arrived at the property at 3:00 and waited in a rather small lobby with several other disgruntled families waiting for their room. Was not assigned a room until closer to 4:00. There was only one person checking in a line of people. When he asked the person behind me to go to the next window I informed him I was already told by her that she was \"busy.\" 2. I asked to be in a building near the front of the property since my husband has a health condition and I am always concerned about an ambulance. We were placed in Building 6 near the back of the property. 3. We had a two bedroom unit. The toilet in one of the bathrooms did not work properly, and the other bathroom's toilet had a broken handle. I called, but they were never fixed properly. 4. One evening we came back rather late to find our door \"unlocked.\" Our three year old granddaughter pulled on the handle before we inserted the key and it just opened. 5. I called about the lock but nobody showed up when we asked. The next day we called again and I was told they would send someone \"right out.\" After waiting we left with the hope that our belongings would not be disturbed we left for the park as nobody arrived. 6. The day of check out, we were awakened at 9:20 to make sure we were leaving. At 10:50, another knock on the door asking if we were leaving. I said yes, within 30 minutes. I asked if I had to check out and she said \"no, just leave the key cards.\" While waiting for my daughter to finish, I stripped the sheets from the bed, vacuumed the carpet, swept the kitchen floor, my husband emptied the trash, placed the towels in one area, etc. and took our bags to the van.

You can not beat the price or the location. The first time we stayed we were located in the 3rd building and on the third floor which was too far away from the pool for my taste but in the end it didn't matter because we didn't end up using the pool. The 2nd and third time we stayed in building 1 with a ground floor room. This location is perfect for access to the pool and the main building for continental breakfast. We like this hotel because each child gets a bed. We have a room for the kids, grandparents and ourselves. My kids go to bed early and we have a living space to hang out and relax. The hotel also sells tickets to the parks which is convenient and quick. They also offer great prices and deals for the park tickets. Make sure you ask for the AAA discount if you have a membership. You will receive a 10% discount on your room rate. Around the corner from the resort is a giant Super Walmart which is where you need to go for all your food and water. Quick trip and money saving. You will also find all your rain ponchos and Disney souvenirs at a drastic discount! One problem we did run into this trip was with a Pizza Delivery service. There were flyers placed strategically throughout our room when we arrived. My husband called and ordered a pizza for $16.95 as stated on the flyer - while I went to Walmart to stock up on our food for the trip. The pizza arrived and my husband was charged $26.50! The guy said was taxes and delivery fees. When I spoke to the front desk about the terrible rip off - the girl raised her hand and said the hotel is not responsible for the delivery service (which I was not holding them responsible) they do not sponsor any delivery services in the area. Then why did we have three flyers in our room! The cleaning staff strategically placed them in my kitchen, dining room and by the phone in the bedroom! That is the only complaint I have to date about this resort. Other than that - we love it. If you are coming here, prepare to bring small bottles of dish soap and laundry detergent.

I had asked (via Facebook) for any recommendations for a condo to stay while in the Disney area. We were traveling with our two young children, my mother, and my sister, and thought a condo would be a better option than the two hotel rooms we had booked nearby. After speaking to my friend and thoroughly researching the property here in tripadvisor, we decided to give it a shot. I am glad we did - we stayed three nights in a three bedroom in Building 3 and were very comfortable. We had a couple of minor issues - the kitchen sink was emitting a strange smell and there were some items under beds and the couch that likely could have been cleaned up with a more thorough cleaning crew. We didn't make a big deal of the sink since we were rarely at the condo, though I am sure they would have at least checked it out if we had called it in. We just returned from a second three night stay yesterday and again had a very pleasant experience. This time it was just us and the kids, though we did have a three bedroom again (Building 2 this time, on a high floor - nice view) because it was a last minute trip and evidently the two bedrooms are booked early. No matter, the nightly rate was still more reasonable than just ONE room at any of the hotels (at least any that we would want to stay at) nearby and we saved money just by having a kitchen and washer/dryer. Additionally, our sanity was saved thanks to our kids being able to have a separate room. I noticed a similar cleanliness issue on this trip - trash was found under one of the beds that really should not have been there - makes you wonder what else is missed. Additionally, the bathrooms seem to be showing some wear and tear and could have used a good caulking - but this is typical for the humidity of Florida (we live in the state as well and have similar issues in our bathrooms). We did not take advantage of the pool on either trip, but it looks like a great place to have some fun. We also did not do breakfast - I have seen a lot of people complaining about the lack of variety, but this is a continental breakfast that is included in the room rate, I don't see why that warrants a complaint. It is just as easy to drive to the Publix that is five minutes away and get some healthier options and eat in your own condo, on your own time, without being crowded. Additionally, after reading the negative reviews on the park shuttles, we opted to drive ourselves to the theme parks and felt that this really was the way to go. Bottom line is that this is a very affordable place to stay, generally clean, and extremely convenient to the parks, without making you a slave to the Disney property.

The continental breakfast includes bagels, toast, pastries, fruit, cereal, coffee and juice, cream cheese, peanut butter, jelly and other condiments and was always wells stocked at 0730-0800 when I ussually arrvied. With the full kitchen we also were able to keep eggs and yougurt to suppliment breakfast and we cooked for ourselves a few nights as a break from restaurants. You can choose from different housekeeping services during your stay and the condos have a vaccum, brooms and mops and complimentary cleaning supplies and dishwasher and dish soap. We opted for the towel exchange and had fresh towels waiting for us every afternoon on our return. The complex is a 5 minute drvie to Walmart, grocery and liquour stores outlet malls and any kind of restaurant you could desire. The rooms are very clean and spacious with very comfortable beds and wonderful showers and soaking tubs. My only complaint is that the lighting is not very good in the bedrooms or bathrooms and always seemed to dark and dreary. However, that gave me a good excuse to grab a cup of coffee and sit on my balcony while applying my makeup. We've always stayed at one of the buildings by the pool which is highly recommeded. Building 6 and 7 have quite a hike to the club house and pool. You won't be disappointed if you stay here.

We arrived in the morning but tried to check in at 1pm but our room was not ready yet. We were travelling with our 1 1/2 yr old and 4 yr old and I'm 6 1/2 mths pregnant so it was a long day already.

I thought we would be able to get our room early again when we had visited back on June 2011 with the 2 kids. We showed up at 4:30pm and the room was not ready yet. My husband waited 10 mins and we got our cards. With groceries already in the SUV from 1pm, we were anxious to get inside and settle in. We were extremely happy with our stay as usual. The 3 bdrm suite was amazing and wish we were able to enjoy this with another family. We stayed at a 2 bdrm suite last time. The girls enjoyed the extra space and rooms to play in and it worked out great. The pool was a little cool but my 4 yr old enjoyed it and didn't bother her at all from going almost everyday if we were not at the Disney parks. Breakfast is always great. We knew of the continental breakfast and what they served so we bought eggs and waffles to add to our breakfast selection which worked out great. Bagels, toast, pastries, fruits are always nice to have and we always appreciate the free continental breakfast provided at WQO. We took advantage of the washer/dryer as it saved us from bringing extra luggage so we packed less clothes with us. Garbage was collected everyday as we opted for no housekeeping services. Our stay was wonderful and the people working there and staying there were nice. Its nice to stay at a resort when we are not too far from the Disney parks.

We were able to get a three bedroom suite with a full kitchen and dining/living area for much less than we would have paid for equal space at other hotels in the area. The bedrooms offered more than adequate space and were very well appointed. We had a screened-in balcony that overlooked a wooded area and pool beyond that. The screen was torn in spots, but that wasn't a huge problem as it was January and the bugs weren't out in full force yet. Our room was in one of the buildings furthest from the main building and had we wanted to access the pool or common areas we would have had to drive. The pool area is gigantic and beautiful! There is also plenty of parking available for each building. They offer complementary continental breakfast with your stay. It is a continental breakfast so expect plenty of starches and no proteins. The bagels and pastries are quite good for what they are and the staff works hard to ensure everything stays well stocked. The juices are dispensed from a machine much like a soda fountain and taste a bit watered down. There is very limited indoor seating, but more tables are arranged just out the door and around the pool area. The staff members are quite friendly, gracious and attentive. Check out can be accomplished over the phone or by electing automatic check out when you register. There is a mandatory $35 cleaning fee if you're staying fewer than 3 nights, but considering the low cost of the room it really isn't a big deal.

On vacation to have 2 full baths, kitchen, and in room laundry fits my family perfectly. We stayed for 3 nights starting on December 26th and a few suggestions: 1) skip the \"continental\" breakfast. I have stayed at a lot of hotels, but have never seen such a poor display of continental breakfast, even at a $40 motel (back in the college days, blah, never again.) The kitchen/food pick up area is so small! This complex has multiple buildings so its just math. Way too many people, too small an area. And the options were just sad. In the \"pastry case\" they had ran out of everything but white bread. Slices of white bread in a luxury resort as the pastry? Sad. The kitchen only had cold cereal, coffee, juice, and milk. That's it and everything was running low. No english muffins, no yogurt, not even a Nutri Grain bar or piece of fruit. My kids, oh, I will never hear the end about how bad breakfast was that day. Mom picked a nice hotel, but dropped the ball on food. Just go out. Orlando has plenty of restaurants or if you feel up to it, cook in your room. The other suggestions are: 2) tell people in advance about the housekeeping fee. They have fee system for housekeeping. $5 for towels only all the way up to $39 per day for full service. 3) the shower heads - these are standard, many hotels have switched to the wider, waterfall version, but that's just a nice to have feature.

This is our 9th visit to Orlando, but sadly I would not consider the World Quest again unless they resolve some of the problems we found. The resort is very pretty and the basics of the condo's have been built to a high standard, but I can only think they then ran out of money, because simple mistakes spoilt the place. Why place heavy wooden dining furniture on a tiled floor without a rug or felt on the chair legs? From our ground floor condo all we could hear was the furniture being moved in the condo above (and if you were in 202 block 6 on the 17/18 December, why were you still dragging chairs around at 3.00 am??) The beds were so hard I had to buy a foam topper in Walmart. The only mirrors are in the bathrooms, but none in the bedrooms. When we arrived the tap was hanging off the sink and the blind missing in the kitchen, giving anyone in the car park a good view in. Surely the cleaning staff would have noticed this and got them repaired before we arrived. They were fixed promptly once reported, but this should have been unnecessary. There were food stains on the front of the dishwasher and front door and a can of beer left in a dresser, so the cleaning wasn't great. The condo's have the potential to be outstanding because the granite tops, lovely bathrooms and quality curtains and lounge furniture are all there, but are let down by other things. The pool area is beautiful, but the water in the pool was freezing! We were stopped at the entrance by security to show a pass, but If you came in after 11 pm the barrier was up and anyone could drive in! A security coded gate would solve this. The resort is in a good area for Disney etc but there is a lot of road noise at Block 6. The breakfast is as expected in an American hotel and perfectly adequate, but the greed of some of the other guests put us off going there. One woman filled a carrier bag with cinnamon buns while others were bringing baking trays over from their kitchens and filling them up to take back (sometimes still in their pyjamas!!). On this note, it seems people are getting ruder year by year. It used to be the case that, for example, when a Disney show was on, everyone would wait until the end and then applaud the cast. Now, the merest hint that the show is coming to a close seems to be a sign for many people to get up and leave to tear off to the next attraction, blocking the view of those who want to watch all the show and showing no courtesy at all to the cast or other people. The request to \"move to the end of the row\" in a theatre is ignored by many, who think they should sit in the middle of the row for the \"best\" view and expect everyone else to clamber over them. This is Disney - ALL the seats have an excellent view!!!

We loved it! We were in building 2 overlooking the pool (3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms). We felt so spoiled each having our own bedroom and bathroom for such a fantastic price. The huge kitchen allowed us to stay in for many meals saving us a lot of money. We opted for the no-charge, complimentary garbage removal and didn't pay for additional housekeeping. We were very happy with this choice. The grounds are very clean without sand, so you're not tracking any dirt into the place and there's a washing machine and dryer, a dishwasher, cleaning supplies, etc so its easy to stay tidy. I would recommend this resort for families, couples, singles, etc. The resort does attract a lot of families though, so be aware that you'll be sharing the pool and deck with lots of kids. I can't say enough good things about this resort, but thought hard to come up with a few potential negatives: Positives: Friendly staff and accomodations are superb. Free WiFi. Free shuttle to Disney World. Large and clean pool with comfortable loungers. Free breakfast (bagels, danishes and fruit). Suite was massive, clean and well stocked. The resort is on a dead end road and over looks green space so its very quiet. We booked 3 months in advance and got an amazing rate for advanced booking. Potential negatives: You're not really within walking distance of anywhere, but rental cars are so cheap in Orlando so it doesn't need to be an issue. End of stay housekeeping fee of $39 if you stay less than 4 days (but you won't want to leave before then anyways). On-site store has basic items, but you'll need to shop elswewhere if you want fresh produce. Styrofoam cups at the water station and breakfast (personal pet peeve).

We were extremely happy with the resort. The condo was a good size and was furnished nicely. The pool area is beautiful and the pool is huge. We didn't take advantage of the complimentary breakfast so I cannot comment on that. We went to Disney each day and the hotel is VERY close to all of the Disney parks -- just a quick 5 minute car ride (straight shot, no traffic). We did not use the hotel shuttle to the parks. Their shuttle will only take you to Epcot and it only departs 3 times in the morning and then does 3 set pick ups at Epcot in the evening. (We had small kids and didn't want to be 'stuck' at the park with a tired kiddo so we opted to drive ourselves.) If you stay in Bldg. 6, it is a 5 min walk up to the resort pool and clubhouse -- so if you are going to swim a lot then you probably want to stay in Bldgs 1, 2, or 3. The only things we didn't like about the condo were lack of lighting & limited seating in the living room. The bedrooms did not have enough lights in them -- they were very dark, in fact in the small bedroom it was so dim even during the day that you could barely see to pick out your clothing for the day. WorldQuest needs to install additional lighting in the bedrooms (i.e. and overhead fixture or can lights) In the living room, there was only a couch and 1 chair. We had 4 adults and 2 kids staying in the condo, so there wasn't enough room for all of us to sit. It would be good if they could add a loveseat in the living room for the 3 bdr units. Overall though, these complaints are very minor and would not stop us from staying at Worldquest again. For the price of a basic hotel (i.e. Hampton, Fairfield) we got 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, a full kitchen, washer dryer, a dining room, living room, and balcony.

While the rooms were very nice and clean initially, there were many things about our stay that completely turned us off to this hotel. After our first night we realized that we were only provided with 4 bath towels. In a condo of this size that is just ridiculous. We called housekeeping for more towels, which they brought up very quickly, but were surprised at checkout with a $40 housekeeping fee. This upset us because that was the only thing housekeeping ever did for us. They never even came in to make the beds. Speaking of beds, the sheets barely fit the beds and we found ourselves having to completely remake them every morning. What they call a continental breakfast was laughable. They only provide food in carbohydrate form (cereal and pastries), although there was some fruit. They never refilled the 2% milk and left it empty after 8:30. They claim that they have shuttle service, but it is only available a few times a day. It's NOT a constantly running shuttle service that you would expect, so you have to plan around the shuttle schedule if you want to use the service. After using the shuttle on the first day and realizing how inconvenient it is, especially for a family with young children, we ended up driving ourselves to the parks and paying for parking for our own convenience. The shuttle was also late to pick us up in the morning and we nearly ended up missing an appointment for one of our prepaid activities at Disney. So overall, the condo itself is very nice. It is kept up to date. The rooms were beautiful and held our group very comfortably. It is the (non-existent) amenities of this hotel that make it a \"never again\" for us.

We stayed in building 7 which was only opened in June of this year. It was extremely clean and a a great size. We stayed in a 3 bedroom for 8 nights. With a family of 5 ,we would be killing eachother normally within 2 days. But this place is like a home away from home. There were 4 large flatscreen tv's. The pool was beautiful and probably one of the biggest pools we've stayed at. Even with other families in the pool, no one seemed to get in anyones way. The only downfalls to this resort is that it is so big. Being in building 7, the pool is quite a long way away. You don't want to really walk it in the heat. Also the breakfast was pitiful. We went down in the beginning but ended up just making breakfast in our room because even the toast there was nasty. Also, there was a lady down in the breakfast area working who pretty much had no personality and a wicked attitude. It surprised me that she was working there considering absolutely everyone else that worked there was very friendly and more than helpful. We did encounter a little problem while we were there. On our 2nd day at the pool there was a bit of a fuss because there was a snake in a bush. The resort manager and other worker were trying to find it and had a net so we thought that they would catch it and release it in the open lake area right beside the pool. To make a long story short, thats not what happened. The RM caught it and whipped its head to the ground killing it instantly. My 3 daughters watched the entire thing and my 11 yr old was devasted. She cried for 2 hrs and the next day refused to go to the pool. I got her to write a note to the resort and dropped it off before going out later on. When we came back there was a letter from the resort manager saying he was sorry that he did that but most people were pleased that he did. He then said from now on they would \"shoo\"them away and she saved the lives of future snakes. She was happy with that. All in all, it's a great resort, great location too.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stansted Mountfitchet, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWorld Quest\u201d", "Author": "navtej b", "ReviewID": "UR118106607", "Content": "Good Location.

I was burned once before booking on the internet (the hotel looked fantastic in the pictures - but the rooms were disgusting and dirty and service terrible) - which is why I relied heavily on other reviewers this time around and why I am posting my own review (really never do this). The resort is very close to all things Disney and not far from Universal as well - gated community so safe. We did not take advantage of the shuttle - rented a car for convenience and to see other sites (be fore-warned that parking at any of the parks is anywhere from $13-$15/day) We were in building 7 (the newest building :) - yes far from the pool (but not too far for our 3 teenagers to walk). The pool facilities were great - lots of equipment to play with as well, with a Tiki bar and whirlpool. Complimentary breakfast was a nice bonus (don't know what others expect of a COMPLIMENTARY breakfast - it was danishes, toast, bagels, fresh fruit, cereal, coffee, juice - lots of it and replenished often). Our room was very spacious (3 bedroom suite) - absolutely wonderful to return to after a day at the parks to relax. With 3 teenagers, it was nice for each bedroom to have a flat screen TV to retire to and get a little down time. The whole place was VERY clean (I am picky!) - nice to have the amenities of a kitchen and washer/dryer. We mostly did pre-assembled meals - pizza, appetizers etc. - this cut down on restaurant costs and it was nice to sit and relax in the room. The surroundings were beautifully maintained and quiet as this resort is at the end of a large piece of land and not too populated. Contrary to what others have said, I found no \"hidden\" costs - we booked through Expedia and everything was clearly laid out (some travellers may be confusing this with hotels - it was a condo and yes we paid a one-time $39 cleaning fee at the end of our stay).

But WorldQuest has definitely cured my feeling very sick from that flight. The resort is about 25 minutes away from the airport and around $50 by cab. As soon as our cab entered the private road leading to the resort entrance, one can already feel the tranquility of the place. At the entrance, a security staff greets you and you can just marvel at the mediterranean feel of the place. The pastel-coloured buildings are very European. It's like you have just made your way to a Spanish town. We arrived in the evening and 24/24 staff at the reception was very friendly. The surprise comes as soon as you open the door to the villa. We had a 3-bedroom villa on the ground floor. It was huge. The master bedroom even has a huge bathroom with whirlpool bath and a separate shower. A definite treat for adults and kids as well. The place felt like a cozy second home away from home. An ideal place to crash during stressful times. I forgot about jetlag immediately. However, if you are coming from Europe or have taken a flight, it\u2019s useful to rent a car in advance. There is no restaurant at the resort. There is a mini-mart that sells chips, drinks, sweets and items of necessity but that\u2019s all. Even if the resort is very near the different Disney parks and other attractions, they are not readily accessible by foot. Even if the villa is designed to do some home cooking, one still needs to drive to nearby groceries or Walmart to get food supplies as one has to locate and drive to the nearer restaurants. Breakfast is plain American breakfast of toasts, bagels, Danish and muffins. Coffee and juices are from machines and everything\u2019s eaten on disposables. The pool is cleaned early everyday and swimming starts around 10:30 if you like. There\u2019s a separate cabana for towels so you don\u2019t need to bring towels from your villa to the pool area. The pool is nice and there\u2019s also a Jacuzzi. If you plan to stay at the poolside for the whole day, you can also order snacks like pizza, hotdog, cheesemac but that\u2019s all. Nothing fancy. The cleaners are all speaking primarily in Spanish but are very friendly. Wi-Fi is free and available even in your own villa. This is very important especially if you want to stay in and just order food delivery. February is a quiet month because there are no tourists and traffic. Most of all, the weather and temperature are perfect for this time in Orlando. I never had to bring a jacket with me, except on the last day which was a little bit cloudy when I felt the need to wear a hoody. WorldQuest is definitely an ideal resort for a family who wants to relax after a hectic day in the Disney parks. It\u2019s just a big waste to use such a homey place as a bed and breakfast as what we have done because we were mostly out after breakfast and only coming back when it\u2019s almost bedtime.

It sent us slightly wrong when we were nearly there, but we managed to find it in the end. Be aware though, it's not in walking distance of any restaurants, so you will need to drive if you are eating out. There are plenty of restaurants within a 5 minute drive, and a big Walmart nearby (opposite the Lake Buena Vista Outlet Mall). My recommendations would be - don't take too many clothes, that's what the washer and dryer are for and I would recommend a sat nav if you are driving - we would have been struggling if we didn't have one. The Tiki bar only stays open until 9pm, which we thought was a shame, it would be nice to have a drink after a hard day at the parks! All in all, great value for money - we booked with Jetsave and it was just as cheap as arranging it all ourselves for our particular requirements.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fermanagh", "Title": "\u201cGood Location\u201d", "Author": "Tonifermanagh", "ReviewID": "UR115423251", "Content": "We are just back from Orlando, and stayed in WorldQuest Resort for 8 nights.

We had only 2 bathrooms, as opposed to other reviewers saying they had 3. The master bathroom was huge! There was no separate utility room. The washer and dryer were in a cupboard beside the bedrooms, and were very noisy when you put your washing on after coming back late from the parks! The windows from two of the three bedrooms looked out onto the internal corridors. Other guests walking past can look straight into your bedroom if your curtains are open. We kept them closed all the time for security. I think blinds would have been a better option for the hotel, for privacy. Most of the rooms seemed to be like this. The beds were quite uncomfortable. The sheets seemed too small for the bed, and kept springing off during the night, revealing a very lumpy mattress protector! We selected the clean towels option for an extra $5 per day. I think this is very good value. We stayed for 8 nights but were never left clean bedlinen to change the beds. I wonder how long you would have to stay to get clean linen? We have stayed in Vista Cay several times, but picked World Quest this time due to the location. While World Quests location and proximity to the parks is fantastic, Vista Cay is a far more superior resort.

The location was perfect - close and convenient to Disney, as well as area eateries, yet once we drove through the gates, we felt like we left everything behind us. The only downside we could find was the free resort shuttle to Disney, as it offered limited pick up and drop off times that did not coincide with our boys' nap schedule.

Did point this out to reception staff who agreed and said they too had walked into the doors but didn't appear to be concerned of possible injuries to children. Having said this our stay was brilliant. Breakfasts were as expected for the price paid. As other reviewers have commented the staff maintained the cereal, bread and pastries stocks. Was made aware of the cleaning services available and chose only to have bins emptied and extra towels which we thought were fairly priced. The complex was a good Taxi ride from any attractions but between 4 of us worked out fairly well. Would hire a car next time. One criticism would be the taxi company the complex uses. USA transportation. Our son who was with us had stayed at the complex in Sept 2010 and once ordered the taxi arrived within 5 - 10 minutes. This stay we were waiting for over 25 minutes most days. Again the front desk staff were helpful and tried to address this. In the end we called for the taxis well before we wanted so the wait time was reduced.

I did not check any reviews at all. We were concerned that once we got to the hotel that we would be disappointed because the hotel presented itself as too good to be true, as has happened to us a number of times at other hotels. We could not have been more wrong. This place is beautiful. We love the Mediterrean style buildings, the colors used throughout our unit. The furniture was attractive and firm (no sinking feeling here), the kitchen more than met our needs (we cooked breakfast and dinner on most nights we were there. Our master bedroom and bath was beautiful and the kids (while they had to share the two other bedrooms) spent alot of time in their rooms when we were not doing something or going somewhere. Finally, while we cooked our breakfast, some of our kids opted for the continental breakfast in the clubhouse - they loved it and the spread/amount of food was impressive. The hotel did not go cheap on the free breakfast. The pool was fantastic. It is a 10,000 square foot pool. It was never crowded and other guests were considerate. The pool furniture was plentiful and we never had any problems getting loungers for the six of us. The only regret we have is that we did not use it often enough. The landscaping around the pool and the buildings was very attractive and well maintained. The hotel management had plenty of employees makng sure that the property looked beautiful. This was our return to Orlando after a 6 year hiatus and we wanted our children (and ourselves) to get to Disney one more time. We have stayed at the Polynesian (great but prohibitive) and at the Nick Hotel (which is about a half mile from World Quest ). Never again will I pay hotel rates for one room and one bathroom. So long as this place is around, we will go there. We even had some excitement on our last night. We had just returned from Animal Kingdom and were relaxing when an electrical storm came to our area. Lightning and thunder struck at the same time and our son ran out of his bedroom to tell us that there was fire (not on hotel property) but just outside the parking lot area in an wooded area. I called the front desk and then saw her running to the area of the fire. The fire department (about 3 fire trucks came) was there in about 10 minutes and took care of the fire. We had to evacuate our building (Building 2) but were allowed back in after an hour or so. Overall, we still talk about World Quest and how much we like our stay there. I have offered to take the family back there if we skip our trip out west. So far no takers but I have 3 more weeks to make it happen (I already have one convert to my cause).", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, SP", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, lacks service\u201d", "Author": "sitraveler_11", "ReviewID": "UR114847001", "Content": "The first impression I got when I arrived at Worldquest Resort was: Wow!

The only complaint we have about worldquest is: 1) they charge you for cleaning; 2) the breakfast is very modest and is offered only until 9:30. If you book a hotel, what you expect, at least is cleaning service. Not only they don't provide that (only removing your trash, what is done, but not very effeciently, and that's all), but they charge you an expensive amount to have your towels changed and your room cleaned. Not only that, they do not refill soaps and toilletries. Be prepared to bring them from home, or be prepared to buy some at Orlando once you arrive because the soap they provide you with lasts 1 day. And the breakfast, well.. it's very modest. Don't expect much here. And often very crowded. And in my opinion, should last at least half an hour longer. You're on vacation, after all!

We've stayed in and around Orlando approximately a dozen times & this was the only time I've been truly disappointed with our accomodation. We're not overly fussy, always look for the good in things as opposed to hunting out negativity & in fairness had arrived at Worldquest after a wonderful Disney Cruise so we'd gone from being pampered to looking after ourselves but ultimately, we just couldn't settle at Worldquest. The location is very good, whilst the nearest stores or restaurants are a couple of minutes drive away it is incredibly close to Walt Disney World & sits very much on it's own in a wooded area at the end of a quiet road. I think this was a small part of the problem with the resort in fact in so much that due to it's location & position around the lake there were far more bugs around than any other place I've visted in and around the area. I'm very aware that the whole area has ultimately risen from swampland but it's the first place we've ever stayed where we felt it a nuisance. Whilst we never spottted any cockroaches or larger bugs in the apartment itself, the public areas around our block were constantly teeming with insects & we'd wished we were staying closer to the pool & further from the lake which may perhaps have led to less bugs (and itching !). The single worst problem with our stay was the level of cleanliness in our apartment but as already stated, this may well have been down to the alternative cleaners. Whilst it wasn't dirty everything felt like it needed a proper clean & the bedroom drawers, kitchen cupboards, etc were dusty. We took to cleaning all cutlery & tableware prior to using them which we would not normally do on vacation. There was a cigarette butt smack bang in the middle of our balcony which again isn't the worst thing in the world but shows the total lack of care when the apartment must have been cleaned. The apartment itself was a good size & nicely laid out but the level of furnishings & fixtures were mixed. Whilst the washing machine, tumble dryer were top notch & beds & sofa comfortable, we had leaking taps, torn bed linen & pathetic water pressure in the shower. Large unsightly stains on the cream-coloured bedroom carpet also meant you couldn't help but think the place needed a bit of a refresh which is a shame as generally it didn't need a lot of work. The pool area & main buildings were truly lovely. Well kept, beautifully laid out & extremely spacious, all adjacent to a lake (in which we enjoyed spotting the resident alligators). Overall we got a good deal on a 3 bedroom apartment at the WorldQuest but soon wished we'd booked into a similarly priced hotel as the quality & upkeep of the apartment meant we'd have foregone the benefits of a larger accomodation in favour of a well kept hotel with regular cleaning.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "flgator99", "ReviewID": "UR110949058", "Content": "World Quest always exceeds our expectations!

We enjoyed sitting on our balcony overlooking the nature preserve. It is beautiful and you don't have to worry about getting attacked by bugs as the balconies are completely screened in. The master bedroom is beautiful but my absolute favorite part about the suites are the master bathrooms. They are so open and spacious with a beautiful jacuzzi garden tub in the corner and a huge open shower with a double sink granite vanity. This bathroom is as large as a bedroom. The pool felt wonderful at the end of the day. The tiki bar by the pool is a wonderful addition to make it more of an enjoyable time. The grounds are kept clean. The continental breakfast was really nice. We would pick up our breakfast and come back to our room and sit on the balcony to enjoy the outdoors. I recommend this resort to all my friends.

Please read carefully. My mom and her husband, both seniors, booked this resort as part of a package deal from Expedia. They stayed 5 days 4 night. My young daughter and I stayed 3 of the nights with them. We had a 2br suite, with kitchen, washer dryer, all the stuff you would expect from a resort. I looked up the resort here on Tripadvisor, and saw overall excellent reviews, so was happy for my folks. That was short lived. The place was built 5 years ago. It is a Mediterranean style complex with 5 separate 5 story buildings. Half face the massive pool in the center of the complex. The ceiling fan in our living room did not work. The rooms were dark, not enough lighting, and we don't use alot of light. The dryer did not work, and that sucks for families with kids as us. The 2 single beds in the guest bedroom were of the lowest quality I have ever slept on in a resort. Most regular hotels are far superior in bedding. The plastic mattress wraps did not fit the light weight, cheapo mattress and platform. the wheels were not lockable. There are no blinds on the windows, which is VERY odd for Florida. Only curtains, and not even a light blind on the curtain rod. The windows themselves are cheap, and the whole building had a feel of super cheap construction and materials. I know that line of work well. The window in the guest bedroom was literally falling apart, we attempted to open it, and the entire window came out of the frame. You cant make this stuff up. The doors were louder than one would expect, the elevators were unacceptably slow, 2 minutes in one example for only the 3rd story. The TVs were old school massive units with crappy pictures, all 3 of the,. All TVs had mismatched remotes, which barely worked. Breakfast was below poor. No waffle machine, Only 2 types of semi stale cereal. None for the kids. A weak assortment of ultra small bread items that were all obviously past their freshness. Old fruit, a not much of it. Very small, luke warm yogurts. Just not cutting it. It was an embarrassing breakfast. We had to go eat out every day, so that alone takes a ton of time, and value, away from this place. The dining area was woefully small, more than half the people who came down to eat this pathetic cont. breakfast left, or stood up sipping coffee, which thankfully was adequate. The coffee that is. There were plenty of towels at the pool area however, a plus. The pool cabana has drinks, but they are way over priced, even for a tourist corridor resort near the attractions. Simply not an option. The jacuzzi was massive, uncomfy, luke warm, and not bubbly. The pool is a walk if you get placed on the parking lot side of the pool , there are no walkways through the building, so you have to walk all the way around the building to get to the pool, again, simply not practical for families, or anyone really, what were these designers thinking? Finally, the place is located on a dead end street which is poorly lit, and in the middle of the woods, it is VERY hard to find, and I'm a local. I cant imagine having to GPS your way to this place. Considering the overwhelming assortment and quantity of resorts near Disney, this place strikes out on all levels. It is the first unpleasant surprise for me regarding an undeserved rating here on Tripadvisor. I have ever had. I cant explain how other guests have enjoyed this place unless they simply do not stay at many resorts. This place sucked, and bad.

We lucked out and were placed in building 1. If planning on staying, one may want to request to stay in building 1, 2, or 3. These are closest to the pool and club house where they serve a complimentary continental breakfast which we took full advantage of. Some state not much space to eat but it was okay with us since we chose to bring the food back to our room. They served bagels, muffins, danishes, toast, cereal, applies and oranges, juices, milk and coffee. Could never hear any of the other visitors. Could only hear the chairs being moved around from time to time. However, being close to the pool there were a couple of nights you could hear those swimming until 11pm which is when the pool closes. The only complaint I have which should be taken in stride since you are in Florida and there are bugs no matter where you go, there were these little bugs, something like no-see-ums, on the counter tops looking for food.

This incident was inexcusable and ruined the first day of our 7-day stay in Orlando, as we had to wait around to see what Worldquest was going to do about our room, and then get settled in all over again after moving over there.

The room was immaculate and the rooms were very large and well stocked. The pool was also absolutely beautiful and very relaxing. Our family needed two separate bedrooms and a comparable room on Disney property was running around $600 a night- which is about 3 times the price of these rooms. Also, the hotel seems to be on a new road that leads directly to the Disney gates. We NEVER hit traffic until we got right to the gate and our vacation was during a very busy time of year. No more than 10 minutes in the car to get to any area in the Disney property. For the price, you absolutely can't beat this resort. If I was being picky, I would comment on a few of the things I read about it in trip advisor before our vacation because they are correct. 1). You can hear the cars on the interstate nearby at night. They are relatively far away, so I think it's more bad windows than anything else. Sounds a little like ocean waves if put your mind to it. 2). Breakfast is crazy! People are wild about free breakfast and they ravage the buffet in the morning. We didn't even attempt breakfast after the first day. 3). Shuttle hours don't work for people who have small children and need to come back throughout the day. So if you have little ones, plan on driving. All in all, I would stay here again and again.

It ended up just being the 4 of us and it was really almost like being at home - as soon as we'd get back from the parks the kids would disappear into their own rooms to watch tv. That may or may not be a good thing for your family vacation, but after full days at Disney or Universal, we were all pretty tired anyway. The hotel is low key and a huge complex. We went to the breakfast buffet the first morning but found it way too crowded for us so we stocked the kitchen and made our own breakfast the rest of the week. The shuttle to Disney runs a few specific times a day to/from Epcot. I was told you need to reserve ahead of time. We like to be pretty unscheduled on vacations, so we just drove to the parks ourselves, which was fine. I took our wifi base station and Apple tv and we didn't have any problem streaming video on the room's ethernet. I didn't check to see if the hotel has wifi or if it was available in our room. Overall, it is a very nice, clean, spacious hotel in which to base for the Orlando theme parks.

Brief Description World Quest is more like a timeshare or condo than a hotel. All of the \"rooms\" are multi-bedroom and bathroom units with a living area, balcony, and full kitchen. It is great for large or extended families, or people who want to save money by cooking some meals. It is also located extremely close to Disney -- probably equidistant from Magic Kingdom as some of the Disney value resorts. Pros: - large, modern, clean living space with multiple rooms. - very nice heated pool area and hot-tub (although there is no kiddie pool, which would have been nice). - free, basic continental breakfast (bagels, toast, muffins, pastries, cereal, fruit, coffee, tea, juice, and milk). - very close to Disney theme parks in a low traffic area (10 min drive to most). - very well located -- near other restaurants, shopping -- nothing is right there, but most can be reached in a 5-10 minute drive. - value - we paid $109/night + taxes and resort fees with AAA discount for a 2 bedroom unit, which was plenty big to house 2 grandparents, 2 parents, and 2 small kids (sleeping in sleeping bags on the floor). There was also a sofa bed, which we did not use. - full kitchen - we used it mainly to store and make snacks to bring with us to the parks, but could have saved some money if we wanted to make some meals. Cons - Housekeeping - you must pay extra for housekeeping, and their website lists the fees. We elected only the trash and towel service. On the first day, they completely neglected to do both, and it took a couple of calls to get the service done. On the subsequent days, it was done in a timely manner. - We had a noise issue with one of our neighbors one night around 2 am. We called, and the security desk took care of it, but it took a little while. - I would rate the beds as only moderately comfortable -- I found them to be a bit mushy. All in all, I would stay here again, and definitely recommend it to families that want more of a condo feel than a cramped hotel room.

When I began to look for rooms in Orlando, I scoured (literally) the internet up and down (for days) on this site and sites such as expedia, travelocity, etc. looking for the best bang for our buck. How did I end up choosing WorldQuest? I decided that I wanted us to have a play to relax at night where we could cook in the room, relax, and have plenty of room for my daughter to be a kid. Some of the other hotels I considered booking were Parc Soleil Hilton, Blue Herron, Doubletree Guest Suites, and Embassy Suites, but in the end I put faith in what I saw online in World Quest. Overall impressions: A true diamond in the rough among TONS of Orlando hotels in and around Downtown Disney/Lake Buena Vista. The rooms were actually a little bigger and nicer than I even expected based on the pictures I viewed online. Check-in was extremely easy, and the price quoted online was the exact price I ended up paying the resort. The pool was great (and the hot tub) and very clean. As for safety, I felt VERY safe on the property with my wife and young daughter. I give WQ 5 stars and would absolutely book there again when I go back to Orlando in the future with my family.

Although this Resort is only 5-7 minutes from Disney World and a broad range of Restaurants like Bahama Breeze, Golden Coral, etc, and 4 minutes from Downtown Disney. WordQuest has 7 Buildings, each 5 stories high and each building has both 2 and 3 bedroom suites. There is a Free Shuttle from the Hotel to Disney. All rooms have central heating/cooling and ceiling fans. All rooms have free internet wired connections and wireless in common areas like the club house and pool area. There is a medium-size workout room with Elliptical/Treadmill and some weights. The facility is under 7 years old so the rooms are very modern (granite counter tops and modern tile), with the exception of the TVs, which are tube-type; not a huge deal since they all worked well. There is a huge resort-style pool, cabana for dinks (4pm- 7pm), and pool house with changing rooms/bathrooms. Each of the suites has a well-placed screened-in porch (entrance from Master Bedroom or Great Room) that all have great views of either the pool or a serene pond. We were in Bldg. 4 on the 4th floor. Ted checked us in and was very courteous and helpful in every way. They have different levels of room service so you get to choose what works for you. We were only there for 2 days so we choose the trash removal option only. When we got to our room it was clean, tidy and feature-rich. We had the 2 Bed/2Bath Suite (AAA rate of $105 before fees/taxes \u2013 Awesome Deal). The master bedroom had a King size bed and huge bathroom with a Jacuzzi Tub and a separate shower stall. The other bedroom had two twin beds and a nice size bathroom with tub/shower combo just outside the room. The Kitchen was huge and had a full-size fridge, stove, dish washer and high counter (w/chairs) for eating. The great room had a nice round table for eating, and comfy sofa and love seat. Each room and the great room had a nice size TV, and the great room also had a DVD player. The site has good security features (gated/staffed entrance) and the included continental breakfast was good; the only advice I would offer to WorldQuest would be to add a waffle maker, it would have made my little one very happy for breakfast. On a scale of 1 to 5 our experience was a 5+. We definitely will be back again a fw times this year, in fact this is where we plan to stay when in Orlando.

They still come change your trash daily and will bring you whatever you need. There is a vaccuum in the condo so I did tidy up a bit one lazy raining morning. We washed our own towels. The pool is awesome! You feel like you are at a luxuary 5 star hotel. Towels onsite. The hotel has a gated entrance so we felt safe at the resort. You also have to have a room key to get into the gated pool area. There is a nice small fitness area that I went to a few times. We ran out of dish washing detergent and shampoo about the middle of our trip, so I called down for some more. They brought it up within 10 minutes. They provide hair dryers and bathrobes. I could have saved room in my suitecase. The TV in the den played DVDs. The master bathroom couldn't have been nicer. It had a huge double sink vanity area with huge mirror. The large tub was jetted and the large shower had wonderful variations of water pressure. The kitchen was modern, clean, and had all of your practical kitchen items in it. We couldn't think of anything that we needed that it didn't provide. Our beds were very comforable. The CVS on the way to Seaworld is where we picked up some groceries as that is all we saw other than the hotel shop. I am sure they are all over the place but we didn't venture all around Orlando. We mainly went to the parks, restaurants, and outlets. For a change of pace, it was fabulous to come home to WorldQuest where it was calm and tranquil. It was not very crowded in January, so I am not sure if it would be as fab if it were really crowded. If we return to Orlando, I will definitely stay here again.

The hot tub was nice and large but it was too chilly to use the pool while we were there. The pool deck was very attractive and the pool furniture was very nice. We booked through VRBO so really had no contact with the staff. The best part of this condo was its very close proximity to DisneyWorld. It really is as close as they say. Be aware that signage in this part of FL is extremely poor--we aren't idiots (at least, I don't think so!) and we got lost coming back to the resort the first 2 days. Make sure you consult a map--it's as though Disney wants to keep you trapped in their World and Orange County, despite the millions of dollars that Disney visitors pour into their economy, can't invest in adequate signage. It was a nice vacation. Would I stay again? Maybe--there are many, many condo complexes just outside Disney and I might try one of them next time.

The unit was clean for the most part but one of the rooms did have some remnants from the last occupants. The living room furniture also was worn and looked like it was from a thrift store. The issues with the bedrooms and furniture were surprising since the kitchens and bathrooms were very updated with granite countertops and nice cabinetry. It was very out of place.

The suites at the World Quest are truly spacious, great for dumping all that shopping, toys and souvenirs off.

We booked these appartments through Jetsave, they were an alternative to a villa or hotel rooms. They were reasonably priced, so we weren't expecting too much. When we arrived the staff were friendly and proffesional. Our appartment was huge, it had 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms - the master ensuite had a massive shower, a jacuzzi bath and two sinks! The kitchen had everything you would need to cook and eat everynight if you wanted, with a washing machine and tumble drier.We also had a large balcony overlooking the pool area. This was very nice but the pool was open till 11pm and sometimes groups arrived late and headed straight for the pool, while we were in bed. We had some maid service included in our package, so the beds were made towels were changed and the dishwasher filled and started for us. We were disappointed to find out that the maid did NOT clean or bleach the toilets. It is ideally situated for all the parks, literally 5 minutes from Disney. (It's right behind the Nickelodeon hotel) The pool was always spotlessly clean, with clean towels always available. There was a complimentary breakfast thrown in, it is not up to much, but you could eat there every day for free, so who would complain about it? Overall this is a very good resort. Not as big and isolated as a villa, but with all the benefits of self-catering.

Towels were provided by the pool. The 3-room condo was huge and conveniently situated near all attractions. I thought I would add some helpful hints: * Worldquest is located right behind the Nickelodeon Hotel and making a left turn at the intersection in front of Nickelodeon is a death trap. There was a 3 car accident (with one car flipped over) when we arrived. You can avoid this intersection entirely by using International Drive S (not to be confused with International Drive) which will take you to the Osceola Pkwy to Disney and the I-4 to Universal. * There are no street lights off Worldquest Dr so if you arrive at night, be careful not to miss the turn off to security * Breakfast consists of bagels, toast, 3 types of boring cereal and a pastry of some kind. The breakfast area gets packed so grab a box or bag and take your food up to your room. We would make our own bacon and egg breakfast but pack up some bagels to take to Universal or the waterparks for lunch. * Bring or buy laundry detergent because they don't supply this. You can buy a little one-use box of detergent for $2 at the hotel store. They also didn't re-supply the dishwasher detergent. * Our dryer didn't fully dry our clothes * Drinks are expensive at the Tiki-Bar, even with a happy hour deal. I'd recommend a visit to Walmart. I would definitely recommend this resort. There are no sales staff trying to get you to buy a time share & everyone leaves you in peace to enjoy your stay.

The condo was incredible--spacious, modern, luxurious, and impeccably maintained, with a huge fully equipped kitchen (even a dishwasher and a stock of detergent!), screened porch (we saw a raccoon family toddle by) and a huge living-dining room in addition to three big bedrooms. There is also a washer and dryer in the unit--no quarters needed. Our 13-month-old slept as well in the provided crib as he does in his bed at home--no crappy pack-n-plays here! World Quest Resort consists of several beautiful three or four-story condo complexes around a beautiful Mediterranean-style swimming pool, and the pond on the property gives you the feeling of being out in the Florida wilderness. However, you are about 600 yards from International Drive, with a Publix supermarket and other shopping and some restaurants exactly two miles away. The entrance to Disney is also less than three miles away, making World Quest's location extremely practical even if you decide not to take advantage of their courtesy shuttle to Epcot.

World Quest Resort is far and away the best overall value that we have found in Mickey's back yard, and we will now make this our home in Orlando.

Someone took my sons cellphone and made over $1200 in calls to Honduras. The televisions were outdated and security was very lax, unlike our first visit.

We compared prices of hotels, including the Disney properties and found the World Quest Resort to be about the same or less than the economy Disney Properities. And for three bedrooms, three bathrooms, a full kitchen and a washer and dryer we thought for the price this would be worth trying. We are glad we did. The World Quest was all it sounded like it would be. For the price it was definitely worth it. The only thing I would complain about the rooms were the carpet and beds. The carpet needed to be cleaned or replaced and the beds were not that comfortable. Probably need to be replaced too but I've stayed in places that were worse. Everything else was very clean. The washer/dryer was great. No dirty laundry when we left. Complimentary breakfast....be prepared to wait in lines and not have a place to sit. After the first day we noticed people were coming in with plates and boxes and taking food back to their rooms. That's what we did the rest of the week. Don't expect any variation in what is served either. Cereal, muffins, bagels and pastries is what they served every morning. It was free though. Shuttle service to the Disney Parks.......They do provide free shuttle service. They pick you up in the front of the hotel and take you to Epcot. From there you can catch the monorail to Magic Kingdom or the buses to the other parks. The only complaint I have about this is the times the shuttle runs. In the morning its 9:30, 11:45 and 1:30. The times for bringing you back are 6:30, 8:30 and 10:30. It will take you about 30 minutes to get from the parks back to Epcot so by the time the fireworks show and parades are over you are really cutting it close to make the last shuttle. There is taxi services at all the parks if you run late. It will cost you $16-$28 to get back to World Quest from Epcot. I have read in some of the comments that the water pressure is bad and the surrounding area isn't that nice...we didn't have that experience. We stayed in building #1. It was right up at the front of the complex just a short walk to the main building where breakfast is served and right next to the HUGE pool. The water pressure was better than we have at home. I would recommend if you stay here that you make a trip to Wal-Mart, which is about 2 miles away, and stock up on food/beverages and take advantage of the full kitchen, which is fully stocked with dishes and silverware, dishwasher, full refridge w/ice maker, toaster, microwave, etc.", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plainfield, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat family resort, Great location at a Great Value!!\u201d", "Author": "billyb96", "ReviewID": "UR74508095", "Content": "World Quest Resort is located within 5 minutes of everything in Disney.The onsite pool was excellent and very close to our room.

It was limited in amenities but shopping and restuarants were only a five minute drive away. There was a Super Walmart about a five minute drive also. You could get to all of the theme parks within minutes the backway. It was great not to have to deal with the traffic. The only issue we had and this was a major one was that there was a family from another country who could not get used to our timezone. They sleep all day and got up at 1030 at night. What can you really do at that time of night other than annoy the hell out of your neighbors. Their kids ran up and down the halls and through every room.

Unfortunately, I cannot help comparing it to other places (especially the bright, clean, updated condo we recently rented in Murrells Inlet, SC). We have been to Orlando nearly every summer and, as Marriott vacation club owners, have always stayed at one of Marriott's several timeshare properties there. This time, however, because of unexpected last-minute changes, we were unable to make an exchange for the exact dates needed. After considering several condo options, we decided to rent directly from the owners at World Quest. Although the exterior of the property is aesthetically similar to Marriott's Grande Vista (albeit considerably smaller), the similarities end there. Unlike MGV or other Marriott properties, there really are no amenities. Rather than a marketplace, there's a small overly priced convenience store (similar to what you'd find in a hotel lobby) with limited food selections. There's also no real fitness center but, rather, a minuscule room with four machines. There is only one pool, which gets constant full-sun exposure, with very limited seating in the shade. The biggest drawback, however, is that the resort is situated near the highway, which means there's constant road noise. As for the units themselves, they are rather dated and dimly lit at night. The living room area has a sofa that seats only two comfortably and two upholstered arm chairs. Fortunately, there were only four of us, but a larger group would not have adequate seating without dragging over one of the dining room chairs. The layout and placement of the television (which is bulky and old) also makes it difficult for anyone except those sitting on the sofa to have a decent viewing angle. Each of the three bedrooms, which also have outdated televisions, has a ceiling fan but no ceiling light, making them rather dark (even in the day when the draperies are drawn). In addition to the mattresses not being comfortable, the thin sheets are ill fitting and have to be repositioned every morning. Because the bathrooms, especially the shower in the master bath, are not well lit, they seem \"dingy\" even though they were clean enough. We also had to wash the towels after using them once because they felt as if they'd been washed in harsh institutional detergent and dried without fabric softener. In sum, while our three-bedroom unit gave us the space we prefer, it lacked many of the luxuries to which we've become accustomed.", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guelph, Canada", "Title": "\u201cEverything about this resort was awesome and I would definately stay there again!\u201d", "Author": "FloridaWalk", "ReviewID": "UR71639737", "Content": "We stayed here for a week for my daughters wedding.

We stayed there for 10 nights. In my opinion, the only fantastic thing about this resort is 3 things: The distance from Disney parks, shopping, and the spaciousness of the rooms. We had a 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom condo,and it was gorgeous! Granite countertops in the full size kitchen, and it was stocked with silverware, baking dishes, pots, pans, cups, glasses, everything you can think of that belong in a kitchen, it was there. When I say full size kitchen, I mean microwave, dishwasher, coffee maker, toaster, stove, and refrigerator,.. I loved it. Now, on to the rooms..HUGE livingroom which connected to the diningroom, ceiling fans in every room except 1 and bathrooms. Flat screen TV, DVD player... there was no carpet on the livingroom floors, and bathrooms, only carpet in the bedrooms. Master bedroom had a king size bed with 2 lamps on each side with TV and a en-suite bathroom....absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! My mouth fell open when I walked into that bathroom..the jetted tub was so big it looked like at least 2 or 3 people can get in it. The walk in shower was humungous as well; about 4 people can get in that. Granite counter tops in the bathroom with two sinks. The second bedroom had a queen sized bed in it, it was nice, and the 3rd bedroom had two double beds with an ensuite bathroom. There was a washer and dryer that was very nice to use.. There was also a screened balcony with sliding doors off the livingroom that displayed a lovely view of the disgusting swamp in the back of the resort. Please, Please, Please if you ever think of staying here request a room by the pool because if the staff decides to put you somewhere else, you will be disappointed. Here is where my complaining comes in: We did not sleep that well at night due to the uncomfortable beds, and the noisy freeway. The beds are toooooo soft. My fiance and I bodies hurt every morning when we woke up. I know as individuals we all have our preferences on what types of beds we consider comfortable, and we as people do not have the same classifications..well it felt like we were sinking in the bed, that's how soft they were. The linen on our beds looked thin, worned and old. It needs to be replaced. Every morning or in the middle of the night we had to put the fitted sheet back on our beds because it wouldn't stay on due to us tossing and turning throughout the night. I hated that!! Our room was situated by a nasty, dirty looking swamp, and the noisy traffic filled freeway..it sucked. My fiance and I couldn't be romantic at night or during the day with that! The walls are paper thin and we could hear all the cars that drove on the freeway...I asked if can I be moved to another room, and I was told that buildings 1 through 4 were all booked. We stayed in building 5. Please run! We went to the \"so called\" game room, and fitness center. Both rooms were big enough to put a childs bedroom set in. (probably half the size).. The game room only had 4 games, sorry that is not a game room. They shouldn't advertise that. The fitness center only has 4 machines in there, again that is not a \"fitness center.\" The water pressure in tub, and shower was scarce. I turned the knob on hot all the way, and I could put my entire arm to feel it, and it was mildly warm, almost cold!! I ran bath water for myself and it took almost a half hour to fill up, that's how slow the water was running out. And it was like that the whole time we were there. The staff sent someone to look at it, and I was told that the water is like that because other people in the building was using water too (WHAT)?!? For the whole 10 days? WOW...anyway Another complaint, the lighting in the bedrooms, oh my goodness, we had to take the lamp shades off the lamps to get accurate lighting because that was the only way to make it brighter in the bedrooms. I ordered towel service for 1 day which was 5 dollars. I made the order in the morning at 7:30am, we went to the parks, came back at 11pm, tired, sweaty and wanting a shower, there were no towels. I had to call again for towels and I was mad as hell! That lost points for me..The staff is not particularly friendly only courteous, because that's their job, there is a difference between the two. The elevator in our building (5) was very nasty. We would start our day, and notice garbage being on the elevator, and when it wasn't, no one cleaned the elevator after the garbage been on there, it was gross!! Major point deduction on this issue as well! The pool was nice, but the water was salt water..another gross thing! Another annoying thing, the small garbage can in the kitchen filled up pretty quickly, and they never gave us new garbage bags!! Solicitors would slide pizza notices under the door, and we would wake up and see 4 or 5 pieces of paper on the floor from them..that got on my nerves.. Note, I am picky, however I do not like spending my vacation in a smelly building overlooking a yucky swamp, noisy freeway, so-so service, have to go through drastic measures to get proper lighting, cold water that supposed to be hot, and uncomfortable beds with worn linen. If management or staff or whoever can look into these problems, and possibly add a restaurant to this resort, this place could be 5 stars. There isn't much for kids to do at this resort besides, swimming, so if you are looking for any activities for your children to do, this is not the place. They only have a limited selection of cable channels there, so bring some DVDs from home in case you get bored with whats on TV... Disney and SUPERWALMART is literally 5 minutes away, if that. The size of the rooms are very huge but these quirky things that I mentioned, they need to get that together, fast. I don't think I would stay there again, however if someone wanted to be close to Disney and the other parks, I'd recommend it, but beware! Oh I forgot to mention, they have internet service there as well in the rooms by the kitchen and they provided a ethernet cord to attach to my laptop which was free.", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norman, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort, however...\u201d", "Author": "earniealiduncan", "ReviewID": "UR70316703", "Content": "If we didn't have to sleep, this would have been the perfect resort. The only major complaint I have is the lack of sleep. We stayed for a week in a three bedroom, with my husband and I in the master. The mattress was horrible! I felt like I was sleeping on springs alone and neither of us slept well at all the entire week. My daughters mattress literally slipped off of the box springs every night and we would have to pull the mattress back up. She is not a crazy sleeper or anything, but every time she would roll to one side or the other, the mattress would literally slide off the box springs. We only used our kitchen for breakfast, however it was well supplied for cooking any meal. Includes utensils, glassware, corkscrew, etc. You have to turn the ice maker on yourself, fyi. Bathrooms were well supplied with towels, etc... Every night when we came in, there would be several pizza delivery flyers. We did try one and it was terrible. Small, bare except for the hairs we found in it. Disgusting! The pool was amazing! I got a little irritated that other guests would come out early, claim several good chairs and then disappear for hours until afternoon but other than that it was great. Our rooms were not ready when we arrived and we were allowed to change in the poolside cabana which was very nice. Poolside bar is a little overpriced.... Three beers and a childs smoothie cost $21. We didn't try happy hour, we ended up buying our own alcohol at the local 7-11 and carried it down to the pool. The hotels little grocery store was outrageously priced. A small Ben and Jerry's pint of ice cream was $7.00. Not joking! After that purchase for our daughter, we did not buy anything else. We went to the local Wal-Mart to buy groceries and it was a madhouse! Worse than \"Black Friday\"! The cashier said it is like that every day and night due to tourists. I recommend finding a smaller grocery store if you want to purchase groceries, otherwise you will have to buy body armor in attempt to buy the last loaf of bread. Breakfast was mediocre. A few pastries, fruit, a toaster, cereal and juice / coffee. You have to go early if you want any food though. It goes fast. My husband saw a lady take an entire bowl of fruit and dump it in her bag. The place is gorgeous! Picture perfect! I did ask about the mattresses and was told \"They are only four years old\". We are planning on going back to Orlando but not World Quest. After a 22 hour drive, we really needed a good bed to sleep in and did not get that until we returned home. One more thing....

For the price of a budget room on Disney property, we had a 3 bedroom , 3 bath condo with a washer/dryer we really took advantage of, breakfast, 3 tvs, the list goes on... Actually, the breakfast was about a small as you could get and still claim it as breakfast. Coffee was good, juices were okay, and other than that, there were a couple of cereals and a small case of breads/pastry. I really am not complaining since most resorts offer nothing to eat, but I wanted to mention it because I am always curious about b'fast offerings when selecting a hotel. A down side to this resort would be that this is not within walking distance to anything. A Walmart and some fast food places are within a couple of minutes drive, and nicer restaurants and shops a little further. We were very pleased with WorldQuest, and will more than likely stay again on our next trip to Orlando.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "shopper20", "ReviewID": "UR66974838", "Content": "The resort was perfect.

We loved it here so much, we extended our stay and stayed here for the full 2 weeks. We stayed in Building 1 in a 3-bedroom condo and loved every minute. Being so close to the pool was great and being next door to the club house was great. We availed of the continental breakfast almost every morning and the coffee was so good. At the time of our stay, the resort was at 80% occupancy but it honestly felt as though we were the only ones there, at times. The pool was fantastic - not too deep for the kids therefore I did have to worry too much when they were playing. The lounge chairs were super comfy, very plush and very clean! The whole place was spotless and the staff were remarkable - overall it was the best place I've ever stayed and I've travelled a lot, we will definately be back with bells on and will be referring this place to everyone we know.

I was impressed with the condo-style rooms, large living area and kitchen. We (family of 4) had a 3 bedroom 2 bath condo and shared it with my sister's family of 5 and grandparents - so three families total. The condo was big enough for all, I only wish we had 3 bathrooms since we had to share with the grandparents. The kitchen was well stocked with at least one of everything we needed (except specialty things like rice cookers) and we cooked quite a few dinners there. It also had dishwashing detergent and dishsoap which was nice. The only problem we encountered was that with \"limited housekeeping\" they did not check toilet paper and replace it. This seemed to be strange and I wonder if we had called and requested if they would have supplied these necessities. My mother just bought replacements. The website lists a surcharge for wireless internet service. However, there was free internet access through a cable at the counter/bar area of the kitchen. This served our needs nicely and we thought this was a nice unexpected free service. The location was as good as any other we saw in the area. It was right behind the Nickelodian resort and easy to find after your first visit. The lobby area was nice and we enjoyed the free breakfast a few mornings. It was good quality food, but limited to starches (pastries and bagels), cereal and milk, and apples along with coffee and juice. My only suggestion would be to add filtered water - only water available was from the sink in the prep area. We were in building 6 which was a considerable walk (maybe 5 minutes) from the lobby - especially when you're trying to get everyone ready and out the door - so we only ate the free breakfast when we took the shuttle and were going to the lobby area anyways. I saw plenty of folks filling grocery bags with bagels and apples to take back to their rooms. We ended up buying cereal and milk and having that in our room most of the mornings to save time. I used the gym facilities a few times and while small it contained everything I needed for my workout including a few treadmills, free weights and yoga mats. It also had TV's available and towels. Filtered water was available here and I once I found that out I got my water for breakfast here - it's just down the hall. The pool itself was very nice. I wish the heat had been turned up since it was VERY cold when first entering. But we warmed up to it soon and had a blast! The hot tub was a little dirty in my opinion but much warmer then the pool (but not super hot). Tripadvisor was lacking any info on the free shuttle, so I kept our info sheet to post for posterity. Here is the info: - Reserve a shuttle and pick up a boarding pass from the guest services/ticket area in their \"marketplace\" at least 15 minutes prior to departure on the same day. This gives them the opportunity to try to sell you tickets which are actually a good rate (cheaper then gate prices when we checked into it). - Shuttles to Epcot depart at 9:20 am, 11:30 am, 1:20 pm. Then you have to use Disney's internal (free) transportation to the other parks. The free shuttle was \"average\" - a smaller bus that fit approx. 50 people. - Shuttle picks up right outside the lobby area - past the covered pull-through area - you have to be waiting and watching for it or it might not stop. They were mostly on time for the two days we used it. - Worldquest was their last stop so while you got a direct ride to the park, you also run the risk of having to stand or not being allowed boarding since it's full. We had an especially hard time taking a double stroller - there was just no room for it besides in the passenger seat at the front of the bus. The drivers were very nice but want to be tipped for their effort. One had the whole bus sing happy birthday to my 2-year-old on the way to the park which I thought was very nice - and of course he got a tip! - We found the free shuttle to be effective, however when taking the earliest available shuttle we still arrived in the parks one hour after opening - and anyone familiar with Disneyworld knows the first hour in the park is the most important since it's the least crowded. So most of the other days we just paid for parking to get full advantage of that extra hour. - Same for the return: you loose time in the park if you use the shuttle. Return from Epcot was 6:30 pm, 8:45 pm, and last shuttle was 10:30 pm. They made it clear that these were the DEPARTURE times and that if you weren't there on time they would leave without you. Since the Magic Kingdom closed after 11 pm each night, if you took the shuttle you don't get to see the night-time parade, the fireworks and spend that extra time in the parks. And remember that it takes at least 30 minutes to get back to the Epcot area from the other parks, taking away more valuable time. - Good thing about the return trip: you're the first hotel dropped off = short trip back. Which is nice at the end of a long day. - Another disadvantage of the shuttle is that you can't come back to rest in the middle of the day when it's very crowded and your kids need a nap. No return to hotel until 6:30 pm and no departures to Disney in the afternoon/evening. - Would I use the free shuttle again? Probably not. Unless: I didn't care about getting there at gate opening, I didn't have a large stroller, I didn't want to return to my hotel for a nap in the afternoon, and I didn't mind returning before the evening festivities. My mom was happy to use the shuttle since all of this applied to her. It just wasn't for my little \"disney-crazy\" family. Overall I was happy with our stay. I just won't factor in the free shuttle or free breakfast when doing the cost comparison with other hotels. If it's still a good deal without that stuff then I'd stay here again in an instant!", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cBest in Orlando\u201d", "Author": "ToneOslo_Norway", "ReviewID": "UR65203230", "Content": "WorldQuest is a hidden gem, and it is the best place to stay.

In addition the resort sit parallel to the 417 highway so we could hear cars all night long; I advise to request a room for the other side of the resort so that you could eliminate the highway noise.

It's a beautiful resort that is only one mile from the main gate of Disney World and within ten minutes of Sea World and Universal Studios (both are a straight shot up I-4 from the resort). It's all two and three-bedroom condos with everything you need to feel at home. The beds are incredibly comfortable, there's a t.v. in each bedroom (as well as in the living room), you have a full kitchen with everything from cookware to eating utensils; this really saves money on food because it gets expensive eating at restaurants and theme parks every day, when there is a Wal-Mart less than five minutes away and you can get a few groceries and make your own food. There is also a large screened-in balcony with a full-size table and chairs offering a great view (of either the pool, the lake or the pond; I prefer the pond view from Building 5 because we have seen all manner of wildlife in there, including alligators and countless bird species). The service is great. We had a problem on our first morning with bugs getting in through a rip in the screen on the balcony, but someone was sent up to spray the bugs and fix the screen and it didn't happen again. At the front desk they will try to accomodate room requests (we've always been able to get the building we wanted). During our most recent stay we hated the room we got because it was on the first floor and there were several air conditioning units beside the patio and the master bedroom window. It was very noisy and we asked if we could get a different room, the front desk said it was no problem and got us the best room we've had so far! Try to avoid getting a first floor room if you can as there are air conditioning units lined up along the patios that will block your view and be very noisy. There aren't a lot of recreational activities at this resort, but what they do have is great. They have a fitness center, a large pool and a large hot tub. The pool only goes to five feet deep, which is perfect for me. I don't mind them not having anything else because we spend most of our time out and about in theme parks and such, not at the resort. My only real complaints are about the poolside Tiki Bar and the towel service. The Tiki Bar makes fantastic drinks, but they aren't ever open as late as they say they will be. It's supposed to close at 9:00 PM, but it usually closes before 8:00 PM. I personally think it shouldn't close until 11:00 PM, which is when the pool closes. As for the towel service, they charge you $5.00 a day plus tax to pick up your dirty towels and bring you fresh ones, otherwise you have to wash them yourself (each suite has a washer/dryer combo). I really think this service should be complimentary. I don't have anything really bad to say about this resort at all. The rates are VERY reasonable for the amount of space and amenities you get, and you actually get a great discount if you book online 60 days or more in advance.

Here are some points to consider before planning your stay. First, the positives. This property is a great value for the money. The rooms are attractive, up-to-date, spotless and roomy. The location is ideal for Disney and Sea World. The staff were extremely pleasant. It's obvious that this place is doing all the right things (or trying) to keep your business. Now the negatives. The place is noisy. It's a function of location, design and customer base. Location. The hotel is comprised of 4 - 5 buildings. Buildings 2 - 4 border a noisy highway (about 100 yards away). If you are above the 1st floor, you will hear the traffic. This may be a problem for some. Design. The main living space flooring is tile. Great for cleaning, poor for sound. The dining furniture is wrought iron. The two elements together make for a lot of noise above. We had to switch our room since our upstairs neighbors were up at 5am. Customer Base. The majority of people there are going to the parks. This means everybody is up at 6:30 am and out the door at 8 am. There are about 8 units per floor, 5 floors total. That's a lot of people. Our family are the light sleepers that like to get up after 8am. So it was not the ideal spot for us. Also the pool claims to be heated, but was too cold to use. It's obvious when there's only 3 people in a huge pool, all under the age of 10. The hot tub was nice though. All in all, we probably won't be back. With young kids, sleep is key to a successful vacation. After the 1st night, we upgraded to a 3 bdr on the top floor of a less crowded building. Had that option not been available, we would have had a miserable time. One other point. The front desk was very clear about cleaning charges and upon check in offered a menu of 5 options and their costs (from $0 to $39). I was asked to initial my choice. They are not trying to get one by you.", "Date": "March 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cExceeded High Expectations\u201d", "Author": "TripMoreStressLess", "ReviewID": "UR56421796", "Content": "What a great experience.

After looking at user comments from TripAdvisor, we decided to go for this resort. Staying 10 nights at the World Quest was the best decision of our 3-week trip. We had a huge three-bedroom, two-bath apartment, fully furnished, full kitchen including dishwasher, four TVs, wireless Internet. Like at home, but much better. I read many comments regarding the housekeeping topic. It's like being at home, but someone comes in to take out the trash every day. If you want hotel-type service, there is an extra fee, but we got by without that for 10 days (there is a vacuum in the room, should you need it). The place really is resort-like, with 5 or 6 building units and a huge pool. We were in building #3. If you are in buildings 4 and up, it's a bit of a long walk to get to the gorgeous pool, or to the club house where the continental breakfast is being served every morning. To get to all the Disney parks, we were in the middle of the summer, expecting a bit of traffic, yet it takes about 10 minutes to get to any of the parks. Should you need anything when you're there, there's a Wal-mart supercentre less than 10 miles away from there. The surroundings are gorgeous, the pool is fantastic. It is shallow, so great for kids starting to swim (between 3 and 4 feet deep). There was never an issue to find free long chairs next to the pool. I am not sure I quite understood the opening hours for the Tiki bar, but I didn't know there were so many different types of Martinis... Getting there is very simple, although I missed the road a couple of times, as it is not obvious - and a few street names are somehow very similar. No big neon sign, just a quiet gated resort on a small road. Just find the Nickelodeon hotel, and you're almost there. Something like half a mile from World Drive, which takes you right into Disney.

Minor criticism of the newer blocks concerns lack of lighting in the bedrooms and inability to swivel the flat screen TV in the living room. If you want to watch any TV you need to sit at the dining table. Small points but could so easily be rectified and enhance the visitor's experience. Full housekeeping service is very good but debatable if worth the amount charged at $39 per day! Still all in all a great place to unwind away from the hustle and bustle of ID.

The 2 bedroom suite was beautiful, large, and clean. We did have trouble getting the dvd player to work.

On that note, please be aware that you will be charged $41.54 ($39+$2.54 tax) for end of stay housekeeping if you stay for 1-3 nights. I did not see this fee mentioned on Hotels.com when I booked. I imagine it is buried in there somewhere, but it certainly wasn't mentioned anywhere that I read while researching the property. It was quite a surprise at check-in. Overall, between the taxes and fees added when I booked and the housekeeping fee the room cost 176% of the original price listed on the booking website... so it wasn't the great deal I thought I was getting. My family goes to Orlando about once a month for a quick weekend get away. Now that I know about the house keeping fee I won't be using World Quest for my short weekend trips.

Chose this property based on price, location, and the fact that we could fit our family of 5 in one room. Property is convenient to attractions -- we drove our car, but I think there is some shuttle service available. The property is a complex of 5 buildings with privately-owned condos that are rented like a hotel. There is a condo sales center in the lobby, but no sales pitch whatsoever. Center courtyard has a very nice pool with hot tub. Continental breakfast served daily, small workout facility and 24-hour mini convenience store int he hotel lobby. The property is new, and well kept. Rooms were very spacious -- we had a 2-bedroom suite with king and en-suite bath in the master, a second bedroom with 2 twin beds and another bathroom. Pullout queen couch in living room. Full kitchen, and laundry facilities in the condo. One unique thing about this property is that they offer you a choice of housekeeping options -- no service, towel service only, light cleaning, or full cleaning -- all at different rates. My only complaint is traffic noise. The property backs up to a highway, and it can be a bit noisy. We kept the air conditioner fan on all night, and that helped a little. But if you are a very light sleeper. it could be a problem for you.

We drove down from Mass. and were looking for a suite/condo setup so the kids could have their own room. Since we were on a budget, any setup like that in the parks was out of the question. We chose Worldquest based on price, location to the parks and the overall ratings from previous guests. From check-in to check-out, all the employees were great to deal with. Anytime we had a question, they answered it with a smile and most thanked us for staying there. The room was huge, the pictures on their site do not do any justice to the size of the rooms. Everything was clean, the floors, bathrooms, bedrooms and kitchen. The kitchen was fully stocked with anything and everything you would need to cook and feed your family. As a point of info for anybody who needs ice for their coolers on the way back home, the freezer has its own ice maker and makes alot in one night. I was able to fill my cooler with 2 nights worth of ice making. We never used the hot-tub in the master bedroom or the dishwasher, but everything else worked good. The kids had their own bedroom with bathroom which worked out really good for us. And they loved it too because they were able to play with their toys or video games right in their room while we were able to take care of packing, cooking or just getting ready for the parks. The washer and dryer were a great addition to the room, we were able to wash towels and our clothes before we left so we didnt have multiple suitcases of laundry when we got back home. We stayed in building one. The room was very quiet, we never heard any or our neighbors. It was a short walk, only a couple of minutes over to the clubhouse for breakfast in the morning. We were there at 6:30 most mornings and all the food was out and ready to be eaten. Not a big variety of food but it tasted good and we didnt have to pay a small fortune every morning eating at a restaurant or buying more food to make in the room. The pool as pretty big and always clean. Every morning I would see a worker at the pool cleaning it. We never went to the tiki bar, the fitness area or the variety store, so I cannot comment on that. One thing if you need a luggage carrier, ask for it when you check in, there seems to be only a few around for the entire property and had to wait a little while for one to show up before we could unload our truck at check-in. The location is very close to Disney. We stayed in Disney about 5 years ago at Corondo Springs and at Worldquest we were closer to some of the parks. Unlike one of the previous guests I was able to use my gps and bring me to the front door. But off of the main st to turn onto their property, there is no streetlight, so we would look for the Nickelodeon hotel and we knew to turn from there.

It was there the next day when left despite informing housekeeping during bringing in our luggage. No blenders (really wanted a frozen drink). Matter-of-fact staff; could stand to be warmer on phone. In person they were better but rang fake. Beautiful room and pool area, both were like diamonds- enlarged to show details... Neither were as grand as pics on website depict. In all fairness, it was a beautiful warm environment in the room and quite. The patio was too tiny and noisy from nearby highway. The masterbath was simply elegant! The beds are we ALL had an issue. In three separate bedrooms we had no idea that everyone else is fighting with the sheets literally \"popping\" off the bed. The ladies in the twins beds commented they were small and felt like they were in cocoons when the sheets popped off. In the Queen bed, the individual fought tirelessly to get one side to stay on so she could get some sleep- to no avail. In the master bedroom, the King-size bed had a rough scratchy mattress and not even prayer kept those sheets on fo rmore than fives minutes. When I spoke with the front desk the next morning (Sunday), I was informed there was nothing they could do as their manager didn't work on weekends. I was told I should have called them at one in the morning so they could have someone bring me new sheets: 1) Each of us believed we were the only one fighting the human enveloping sheet monster and 2) my idea of a weekend getaway does NOT include changing sheets sometime around 2 in the morning when they finally got someone to our room. Remind me, when are most people traveling? In Orlando where tourism is the number one source of income, a hotel doesn't see fit to have a manager on duty....huh. In the end I would have considered staying at World Quest Resort again due to it's relaxing poolside and the attractive room, but the bed issue was too much and the staff to NO RESPONSIBILITY for making a comfortable sleeping environment.

Everything started great. I was travelling already for 10 days with my wife and 2 twin girls of 4.5 years. We had been in a very fancy and expensive hotel in Miami Beach and in a cruise, and had found the WORLDQUEST after long researches on the internet, because: 1) It had separated rooms for my wife and myself and the Kids and Wasn't expensive 2) Had a full equipped kitchen, so we could save on restaurants 3) Had free internet in the rooms 4) Had a shuttle to Disney 5) Had free breakfast 6) Free Newspaper 7) Free Parking 8) Free Local calls Everything started great as we got upgraded to a 3 bedroom suite, when we ordered a 2 bedroom suite. The Room was in the resort far from the reception, so don't even think going to this hotel without a car! We had a car, so it wasn't a problem for us. When we got in the rooms we were astonished. It was even bigger that I was imagining. Only good comments about the rooms. Now when did it started wrong you asking me. 1) Internet wasn't working in my room. Technician came but couldn't repair it. So had to take my computer in the middle of the night (working with Europe) to work from the lobby where wireless internet was working. 2) Breakfast is served till 9:30!!! We got at the breakfast at 9:25, as one of the kids was'nt feeling well. I noticed when we arrived that the cleaning woman (VERY UNFRIENDLY) were already putting all the buffet back in the fridge and the cupboard. Every time I had to ask the person, where I could fine the milk, tea, coffee, juice ... And with a very negative attitude she was giving me the milk, before rushing to put it back in the fridge. TRAVELLED A LOT, NEVER, BUT NEVER, HAD SO RUDE SERVICE DURING A BREAKFAST. It was like they were telling you: \" Breakfast is complimentary, so don't even think of eating too long, too late, too much or get service\". 3) Shuttle service: Have been in other disney world hotels, where there was a shuttle service to disney every 15 minutes from morning till night. Very convenient and you don't need a car. HOWVERE AT THE WORLDQUEST there were 3 shuttle services in the morning (every hour) to Disney, and 3 shuttle services at night back. We didn't use it as it wasn't convenient, so used our rented car (thank god I hadn't returned it before, as I was thinking to do) and paid the disney parkings. 4) PHONE BILL RIPP OFF!! I normally never phone from hotels for local calls. But because I had to phone HERTZ RENT A CAR in Miami in order to bring my car back later than presumed and not pay an extra cost of 65$ as they told me , I had to phone them. For an hour I phoned Hertz to Miami, thinking it was a local call and free as promised by the hotel, as it is also in Florida. And as Hertz isn't either the champion of service, I had to phone 7 times (during 1 hour) till I spoke with the right person,and got the promise that I wouldn't be charged by Hertz for returning my car later. Now very happy that I saved myself 65$ , I went to check out the last day from the WORLDQUEST, not believing what would happen next. During the Check out process, that had to be very short as I wasn't expecting to get any extra costs, the receptionist turns to me and says with a big smile \" WOW mister, where have you been phoning to?\" And she hand me a bill of ....... 210$ of a phone bill (equals to more than 2 nights at the WORLDQUEST) . I ALMOST FAINTED!!! Told her that there must be a mistake as I only phoned Miami (300 km- 220 miles away, very short distance in the USA and still in the same state of Florida) and only for 1 hour. She told me that I shouldn't have used the hotel phone, as only picking up the phone is costing 12.5$/call, before even the minutes accounts( so 7*12.5= 87.5$ for only dialling a number + 2$ a minute for the max 60 minutes I used the phone). Immediately she cut the cost by 50%, to 105$, saying that the phone company they are working with are sometimes miscalculating the bill (smells like a rip off? You tell me). I spoke with the shift responsible, and she promised me that the Hotel Manager wasn't in but that he would definitely contact me by e-mail. Didn't get contacted till today, ONLY the 105$ bill was billed to my credit card. So my saving of 65$ with hertz, costed me 105$ (negotiated from 210$), 1 hour at the phone, and 30 minutes of stress at the front desk of the hotel. Started sweet, ended up SOUR!!!

Of course it had to be one of the hottest Junes that area had experienced in years. The condo was warm, the air conditioner had to be set on 65 degrees to cool, and then the two front bedrooms were always a little on the warm side (the beds weren't that uncomfortable, bring your own pillows though). We decided not to have maid service, (with the washer/dryer we did our own towels)we thought to bring out own bath soap, but I'm sure they would have provided more if we had asked, and they did provide daily trash pick-up. The frig never got cold, but kept food.Everything was provided, from cooking utensils to a couple of pot holders. I had read that they would charge if you used their dish detergent/laundry detergent, so we brought our own. There is a Walmart not too far. Easy to get to, however, getting back is not, no traffic light, so go during the day or early morning to avoid traffic.The pool was great, clean considering we had two evening storms while there, the spa was being worked on the last couple of days we were there, however, we were there to visit DisneyWorld, so it wasn't that big of a deal. The daily breakfast was fair. Coffee, juice,milk, cereal, pastries, bagels and toast,with jam and butter. There was always plenty of room in the breakfast area, but then we got up and out early. However, one day we were a little late and noticed some guests would bring platters and really pile on the food to take back to their room. Not sure about the transportation to/from WDW. From the schedule it wasn't convienient for us with a 2 yr old needing down time. My real complaint is that the tile floors were dirty. I don't mean a little dirty, down right black. Not until the last night did we find a mop in one of the bdrm closets. All in all, it was a great place for the money, the distance to WDW (we had our own cars) and the spaciousness of the condo. We had the 3 bdrm ,and with as many people in our group, we had plenty of room. Even the teen liked it. I can't say how the staff was, though we did call a couple of times for assistance and was immediately helped. So I suppose they were quick to respond. For just my husband and myself, we wouldn't stay at WorldQuest, but would stay on Disney property, however, for a large family/group I would recommend WorldQuest.

This hotel offers an outstanding value for anyone interested in a nice, clean spacious suite within easy driving distance to Disney. Room To call this a hotel is really a mis-characterization. It is more like a rental condo with hotel amenities. We loved the spacious suite with 3 bedrooms and over 1,400 square feet. The suite was very modern and nicely decorated. We traveled with 3 children and the extra space helped keep everyone sane. Our suite included a master with king-sized bed, secondary bedrooms with a queen and two twins and a fold-out couch, so you could sleep up to 8 people if traveling with a large family or small group. Although we didn't use the kitchen except to store a few snacks and drinks in the refrigerator, it was nicely equipped with a full size refrigerator and range, microwave, dishwasher, and all dishes and cooking utensils. You could definitely use the kitchen to prepare a full meal if you desired. Amenities The daily continental breakfast was a great way to start the day and saved us money we would otherwise have had to spend on an extra meal each day. It was not the most elaborate complimentary breakfast we have ever had in a hotel, but there was enough variety to keep us happy. We opted not to use the optional houskeeping service and used the in-suite washer and dryer to launder our own towels each day. The washer and dryer also allowed us to pack less and launder our clothes as needed. Definitely a plus when traveling with kids. Location The hotel is only 5 - 10 minutes away from all the Disney parks, and shopping is close by. We did not use the shuttle service they offer to the parks so I cannot comment on it, but I would definitely recommend a car for anyone staying here. There is shopping and dining nearby, but nothing within walking distance. Plus, the property is very large and if you are staying in one of the outlying buildings (5, 6 or 7) you will most likely drive up to the main building for breakfast. Value Our internet-reserved rate of $119 per night was an outstanding value. For this price the quality of the room was unbeatable. For a similar rate within WDW we would have ended up in a double room with a roll away bed and still have had to pay for breakfast each day. Other hotels in this price range outside the park don't offer the space or quality we found at World Quest. Service Check-in and check-out were smooth and uneventful. The rate we reserved was the rate we got. There was no pressure to accept the houskeeping charges. We opted out and that was that. The service provided by Karen, the concierge, was great. She was very helpful booking our theme park tickets and making and canceling dinner reservations for us. We had car trouble one morning and she was very helpful getting us in touch with the auto club and recommending a place to get the battery replaced. My only complaint is with the additional \"resort fee.\" I think this is just an attempt to keep the advertised room rate low. We didn't receive any added services to justify a resort fee. Conclusion We were very happy with our stay at World Quest Resort, and would not hesitate to recommend it to friends.

Looking at the website, it looks fantastic. However, they fail to tell you that housekeeping only picks up trash daily. If you want towels or washcloths daily, there is a fee. Also, if you want your sheets changed, there is a fee. There is a fee for everything they do at the resort other than take your trash. While we were there, we had to call the front desk after being at the park all day, just to have someone come get our trash and bring us towels and washcloths so that we could take a shower!! And, we paid in advance for the service which is what made it even more frustrating. So actually, they didn't even do it with the fee until we would call. We were very disappointed with the service and the stay at the resort. If tyou plan on using the shuttle provided, be prepared. It only runs 3 times in the morning and 3 times in the evening. And, it drops you off at Epcot to catch the monorail. So, make sure you allow an hour just to get to Magic Kingdom or anywhere other than Epcot.

Let's start off with the positives: * Location is terrific. Made it to all the Disney parks and Universal in about 15 minutes. Five minutes to Super Walmart. Five minutes to a variety of restaurants on US-192. * Every worker I encountered at the resort from front desk, maintenance, housekeeping, etc. could not have been nicer and was always happy to help if you had a problem or needed something. * Having the continental breakfast was convenient, although the same selection of two cereals and breads/pastries every day gets old fast. Would also have really liked to have more food available at lunch (Tiki Bar often closed and had very limited selection). * We were in a 3BR/3BA. Really liked each bedroom having its own bath and own televison. * Nice pool area with comfortable, padded lounge chairs. Now on to the negatives which were the source of my disappointment: * I found this resort to be exceedingly noisy. We were first placed in building 4 which backs to a major highway (I think 417 or Osceola Parkway). It was like trying to sleep next to the Daytona Speedway. Buildings 3 - 7 all back to this, with more space between building 2 and the roadway. When I alerted the front desk, they were happy to move us to Building 1 which overlooks the pool. Little did I know that this meant we'd be subjected to screaming kids and teens from 7AM - 11PM+ (closing time did not seem to be enforced) every night. There was also some noise coming through the walls at all times. It sounded like chairs scraping against a hard surface, but I don't know what it actually was since we were on the top floor. * Beds were super uncomfortable and I would not say that I'm particularly picky about this. Larger mattresses were so hard it seemed like you were sleeping on the ground. King in the master had a serious dip/broken box spring. Twin beds were so bouncy it was like being on a trampoline. Pillows also very hard and uncomfortable. Linens on all beds were of poor quality and had holes and stains. Pool towels also very small and poor quality. * Carpet in bedrooms was very dirty and stained. I definitely did not feel comfortable walking without socks. Housekeeping seemed pretty spotty with numerous cobwebs in unit. * Low water pressure in showers and not enough hot water to use spa tub. * Poor/low lighting throughout. No sheers on the windows so unless you're prepared to just leave the curtains open (and second and third bedrooms directly face public hallway), prepare for it to be dark. * We rented directly through the resort (be sure to sign up for Hot Deals password) and did not realize that no housekeeping was included. There were three choices given at check in. We opted for $4/day for towel exchange. Other options were $15/day for towels, beds made and trash take out, $30/day for regular housekeeping. This wasn't a big problem for us since we're naturally pretty neat and clean, but is something to be aware of. * Numerous maintenance issues. During our stay we encountered a broken dishwasher, clogged toilet (that was clogged at time of check in), clogged sink (also that way at check in), non-working television remote, etc. Staff was helpful on all of these issues, but I don't want to spend my vacation encountering problems and calling to have them resolved. * Limited selection of televison channels. This was a more leisurely trip for us and we weren't spending all of our time in the parks so it would have been nice to have more options. Overall, I'd still say that the value was pretty good at this resort since they have such good deals directly through the resort as well as periodically through other websites (expedia, travelocity, etc.). I think whether you'll like it or not really depends on your expectations and what you're looking for. We stayed last years at Floridays, which I'd say is a direct competitor and they had similar rates available this year. Personally, I'd choose to return to Floridays over WorldQuest due to the issues above. If you've stayed at other Orlando timeshares/condos, I'd rate WQ as a definite step below the Hilton and Marriott properties, but a step above of other budget properties like Cypress Pointe.", "Date": "June 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place/Excellent Price\u201d", "Author": "beechbum46", "ReviewID": "UR32840237", "Content": "My family and I (2 sons 14 and 18) and my oldest son's girlfried (17) stayed here from June 13 - 20, 2009.

The first night we were there one of the toilets got stopped up so we called for maintenance. It took about an hour for him to come. When he arrived at the room I also asked him if he could turn up the hot water and he did. He was also very courteous. Also, the hot tub looked great, but it was roped off with yellow tape the entire time we were there. Not sure what was wrong with it. We really didn't have much time for the pool and hot tub since we were at Disney World everyday. The breakfast was okay. Wish there would have been more fruits instead of just pastries. The fitness room is like a large closet...it is extremely small. The resort was very close to the parks and was also close to Walmart and many places to eat.

We had 2 complaints. The tile floors needed a really good mopping. (We did not go barefoot after the first evening). We found the vaccum/broom/ mop on the last evening there. Our second complaint was that the woman replishing the breakfast food said something to our 12 year old grandson about being too early to get breakfast on the day we were checking out, which was 6 a.m. And she would not let him out of the beverage area until she finished putting beverages in the frig. We did not know this until we were walking out the door. But have put in our complaint about talking to a guest's child like she did. We opted not to have maid service. We brought our own laundry detergent and dish detergent. I believe they charge every time you use theirs. The washer and dryer was a stackable, we washed our towels, and there are pool towels at the pool, which was large and beautifully landscaped. The tiki bar has food and drinks and I believe the prices are fairly reasonable. We did not utilize the shuttle, it did not come back at an earlier time (we had a toddler with us), but the drive to WDW is smooth and easy. Since there is no early entry, don't go too early, you still have to wait until the parks open, but if you go early you get a better parking space (closer). The breakfast consisted of bagels/creamcheese, bread to toast, mufifns, pastries, jelly, juice and coffee. This is a great resort for families and large groups.

This facility was suggested by a family member who had stayed there. However, upon reading some of the past reviews, I was a little worried - needlessly I might add! The facility had everything we could have asked for! We had a 3 bedroom/3 bathroom/4 TV suite and it was huge! We were there for a week and we never got on each other's nerves! Usually, 3 kids sharing the same space with 3 adults (one being Grandpa), can be somewhat trying. However, there was extra room to spare! We had a TV in each beedroom as well as in the living room. There was a full sized dining room table and the kitchen had more than ample space and it came fully equipped with everything you could need to cook a family dinner. The dishwasher makes cleanup a breeze. The bedrooms were very spacious and comfortable. My kids were impressed with the fact that they had their own bedroom with their own beds, bathroom and TV. It made relaxing after a long day at Disney that much easier. My littlest one loved the jaquzzi in the Master Bath. My husband loved the huge walk in shower. I loved the 2 seperate vanities with their own sinks. With 3 bathrooms, getting ready in the morning took no time at all! The pull out couch gives you extra sleeping options. The screened in porch/patio is a wonderful touch too, the kids loved to eat out there. The room was clean, and pleasantly decorated. We loved the fact that no one came into the room to try to clean it up for we didn't have to worry about things going missing. The lack of detailed cleaning each day did not detract from the experience for us, in fact, it made it feel much more comfortable and like home. We quickly made the beds each day, put out the trash for pickup and were on our way to explore the parks. The washer and dryer gave us the option to bring less in the way of clothing and take more back home for gifts. We didn't have to pass up the light saber and stuffed animals. The iron and ironing board were handy, the shampoo and soap appreciated and the broom, dustpan and sweeper used! If the kids spilled something, we could clean it up immediately instead of waiting for housekeeping in the morning. If you really want to take time off from housekeeping chores, just pick the option available and they will do it all for you. Even with the extra fee, the room is still a \"steal.\" The ease of getting to the parks is understated in their materials. You can be just about anywhere, at the door of all the major parks, within minutes. We averaged about 15 minutes max. door to door for all of the Disney parks including parking and taking the tram/monorail/ferrry. We ate at many of the local restaurants which thriled the kids because there are so many to choose from. SuperWal-mart is just down the road and you can purchase forgotten items, rain gear, umbrellas and any type of food and snack you could wish for. We stocked the refridgerator with drinks, fruit, lunch meat etc. and the freezer with icecream and the kids were happy and content. We were also able to refill the backpacks each day with water bottles and snacks which saved us time and money at the park. The breakfast options that they provide was more than what my kids eat at home each day. The kids wanted something fast and easy so that we could get to the parks faster! The heated pool was a hit with the kids. It wasn't the least bit crowded and you didn' t have to worry about loosing the kids. Dad and Grandpa loved the Tiki bar and the hot tub was apppreciated as well. The best part of the trip was the staff. They were all so pleasant and helpful, never hestating to answer our questions, provide suggestions for dinner or shopping, Googling info. if they didn't know and to top it off, they printed our boarding passes for our return trip home!

It's a great place for those with allergies as most of the flooring is tile and all bedding is foam/cotton, not down. Unfortunately the beds were not comfortable, but that may vary by unit. The complex was a little too out in nowhere for my taste. It looks like it was built on a newly created road where intentions were to have alot of development, but then plans were scaled back and now there's nothing within a mile of the structure. They did offer a free shuttle service to the nearby LBV factory store outlet center, departing every 60 - 90 minutes. Continental breakfast only consisted of bagels, muffins and juice. We wished there was a hot breakfast available as there weren't any other breakfast places within walking distance. But for those that stay longer than just a couple of days, there's a full kitchen where breakfast could be cooked by yourselves in your unit. Although the rooms weren't equipped for wi-fi, we had no problem connecting. Our ice maker in our freezer didn't work, but we didn't need it enough to say anything to the front desk. The TV remote didn't work, but a maintenance person was up within minutes to fix the problem.

The clerk was very polite. We had a two bedroom unit. It was in the newer section (buildings 5,6 & 7). It was clean and nicely furnished with two bathrooms. The bedrooms are on the smallish size, especially the bedroom with the two twin beds but you really don't spend much time in the bedrooms. We had one television in the master bedroom and one in the living room. I wish that the second bedroom had a television because the tv in the living room was right off the master bedroom and it was a bit noisy when I wanted to sleep and my older kids wanted to watch tv. The master bathroom was very large with a shower, two sinks, and a jacuzzi. The unit had a full kitchen with utensils, dishes, pots, pans,coffee maker, toaster, etc., a dining area and a living room area plus a very nice screened in terrace. A washer and dryer is provided. I loved this as I like to come home with clean clothing. Every morning there is a continental breakfast provided at the clubhouse. It consisted of muffins, pastries, bagels, bread, cereals, juice and coffee. Sometimes there were apples and bananas but I think that once they ran out, they were not replaced. I didn't use the pool but the pool and the pool area looked very nice. I wish that I could have given this property a higher rating but there were some problems that I feel are not acceptable for a property that is supposed to be a higher end resort. 1. Limited housekeeping. Housekeeping consisted of the beds being made and garbage removal. I believe the sheets were changed every couple of days. You can pay to have full cleaning service - I think it was about $30 a day. No clean towels, etc. I don't recall the hotel's website mentioning this. Some people who work hard all year might prefer not to have to clean up after a long day at the park or wash towels every night. Others might like to know of this policy prior to arrival so that they can bring some light cleaning supplies from home like laundry detergent, softener and fantastik for the kitchen so as not to have to run to the local market or have to buy overpriced cleaning supplies at the hotel. 2. Towels - the towels provided were not the best quality. I didn't expect that they would be but the were pretty dingy looking and one was even ripped. Some clean, fresh looking towels would have been much more pleasant. 3. Bedding - Two of our sheets had holes in them. The sheets were on the thin side. Also, the blankets were made of a very thin woven cotton. 4. No hot water - I was really anxious to use the lovely jacuzzi in the master bath. Unfortunately, once the tub was 1/4 full the hot water turned luke warm at best and bath time was over. Taking a shower caused the same problem. Bathing or showering in coldish water was no fun at all. 5. Noisy pipes - there was a constant banging coming from my bathroom. I can only assume it came from the pipes as I couldn't figure out any other source. This property has a lot of potential and I think most of the problems I encountered could be easily corrected.

The resort was very close to perfect. First of all, we booked the reservation on expedia for $129/night. We booked a two bedroom but there was a promotion for an upgrade to 3 br for no additional fee. The upgrade was honored upon early 3 PM check in. The front desk staff was always helpful and very friendly. The three bedroom condo is fairly new construction which of course makes for a cleaner appearance. We had plenty of space and all kitchen utensils were provided. Every room had a tv. There is a washer and dryer. Our only minor complaints are as follows. Although the beds are adequate now, in a year or so I would not want to be sleeping on the cheap mattresses that are in each room. The mattress pad and sheets were slipping around and popping off the corners. Also, my fitted sheet had a hole in it. I didn't point it out to the front desk because it didn't bother me enough. I know they would have addressed it immediately. Next, we saw tiny ants intermittenly throughout the condo. They were in the living room on the floor, in one of the kitchen cabinets, by the entrance to the front door and on the nightstand in the master bedroom. Again, they were such a minor thing, barely visible, that we just mentioned it to the front desk upon check out. The cover on the flourescent light in the kitchen was hanging open during our stay. The two bedrooms in the front were a little cramped with furniture but that didn't bother us much either as we only slept in the rooms at night after long days at the parks. We loved the proximity to the Disney parks. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned Super Walmart is right down the street and in the other direction you can find lots of major restaurant chains like Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Chili's, Macaroni Grill, Chick-fil-a and finally Starbucks. Just ask the front desk and they'll give you directions. We did not utilize the resorts shuttle service as we did not want to be constricted by the departure and return times. So we paid $12/day for parking at the parks. The resort provided breakfast each morning. We did not get to use the pool as we experienced a cold front on the third day of our trip.

You got a family of 5 or more then this is the hotel you want to stay at, please do yourself a favor and don't pay for an overpriced hotel, this was really cheap and I have never stayed at a hotel that was clean and with brand new rooms. I was thinking of booking a hotel at downtown disney for the transportation but I glad I didn't because all they give you is a two beds and a separate room with a pull out couch, in this hotel you get three separate rooms and two bathroom and a washer and dryer, nice air conditioners all new! I rented a car and didn't use their transportation so I really don't know how that goes, all I know is that while you eat their complimentary breakfast there is someone asking who needs a bus to go to the parks. The complimentary breakfast was ok, it had bagels, muffins, cheese danish, only two toasters, there was apple juice and orange juice, coffee, hot chocolate, tea, it was a money saver! Oh yeah before I forget you get free detergent in your room, another money saver. There is security at the entrance. Ok enough about the positives what are the negatives? well let me tell you that their customer service sucks! really really sucks! the staff is not respectful, they don't even smile. Cleaning services only takes out garbage and places dishes in dishwasher and replaces towels and toilet paper but that's about it, you need to clean your own floor, mop, sweep, they won't do it for you! so if this really bothers you then a hotel with those small rooms might be better for you. The pool is huge and not crowded but......(i only went once) it had a salty taste, now what that was I don't know. My whole family didn't like the pool and how horribly salty the water was....Check in is not easy they will try to accommodate you but you will probably need to wait 2 hours to get something closer to the pool. I arrived at 1:00pm they told me a room will be ready by 3:00pm, I didn't mind because I need it to do some food shopping came back at 3:00pm and the room they gave me was on the first floor which I didn't like because you can't enjoy the balcony so I waited 1 more hours and finally decided on a room which had like a half view of the pool but was near it. Let me just finish by telling you that this hotel has more pros than cons, its a great hotel to stay with your family of 5 or more, the cost is worth it(remember there is a fee of 11.99 per night).

The man insisted there is one shower and a Jacuzzi in the other bathroom (but no 2nd shower). Thinking that it was odd that there only one shower (and perhaps the gentleman didn't understand the question), my husband called back in hopes of speaking to another representative. The same representative answered the call. My husband tried again with the fellow by phrasing the question a different way, same result - one shower in the entire 2 bedroom suite. He gave up.

Frustrated I called back yet again and dialed '0' and spoke with the operator (the only human being I could speak with in the middle of a weekday afternoon!). She assured me that the 2 bedroom suite has 2 showers (the Jacuzzi has a shower in it). The resort itself is in a remote location. It is almost in Lake Buena Vista near the Nickelodeon Hotel. The closest park is Epcot. When we arrived, we felt very put off by Hanna, the very unfriendly front desk clerk. The $11.95 \"resort fee\" is hardly recognizable on the website and took us by surprise upon check in. Instead of being nice about it, Hanna seemed to have a take it or leave type attitude -- almost hostile. The fee includes the following: - Wired Internet access via your laptop (NO WIRELESS) - USA Today (NO delivery on weekends) - Local calls - Use of fitness center - One fax per day - Daily shuttle to Disney (only to EPCOT twice a day to/from) - Continental breakfast (no protein or fruit) Obviously the 'resort fee' is tacked on so that the rate can be advertised at a lower rate than the competition. I get the marketing strategy but it still pisses people off. Having two teens anxious to get to Universal, we decided to stay. Although the Superior 3-bedroom suite is advertised to be furnished with one king bed, one queen bed, and two double beds, our Superior 3-bedroom suite (we were upgraded) was furnished with one king bed, one DOUBLE bed, and two TWIN beds. The full size kitchen with all dishes and utensils was nice. The washer/dryer also came in handy as we had rain each day of our stay. Because the clubhouse was so far away, we did feel separate and isolated. Although the suite was nicely appointed, the cobwebs and silk/plastic flowers (we were constantly moving them to get them out of the way) made us feel like we were staying at grandma's condo for the weekend. Although the suite didn't smell funny. The internet connection worked intermittently and the blackout curtains did not cover the windows completely. For the seasoned Orlando traveler, this may be an ideal accommodation for the price especially if you have kids. If you are new to the area, you will want a resort whereby the staff is more accommodating and helpful. Will we stay here again? Most likely not. The fact is, Orlando is second only to New York in hotel room availability.

The best way to get there is to take the first right once you get off I-4 and see Nickelodeon Hotel on your right. You will drive through the side street and see infront of you the entrance to WorldQuest at the end of this road. At the entrance there is a security gate, which is manned by a guard up until 9pm. After that, the gate is usually open. However, the area is so secluded and safe. Our condo was in building 600, which definately was a walk to the main clubhouse, pool, and gym. There is a continental breakfast offered in the morning, which was limited to cereal, bagel, danish, juice, and milk. We stayed for 3 nights in a 3 bedroom condo, which was a great value for the space. The room includes 3 bathrooms, screened patio, kitchen, dining room, and living room. The kitchen had all utensils needed to cook including plates and silverwear. The sofa in the living room had a pullout bed. Overall, the cleanliness of the room, space, and service was EXCELLENT. The employees were also very friendly and accomodating. Regarding the $12 resort fee, it is stated on a brochure given to you at the time of check-in. Many people have complained about this, but it is per diem and not per person. So essentially if you had 4 people in your party, you are only paying $12 for everyone. Another negative opinion I have read regards the distance of some condos from the pool. This is a small inconvenience as most people staying there are probably in Orlando to visit the parks and not the pool. Worldquest is located in an area where there is limited eating places. However, there is a Super Wal-Mart close by and Downtown Disney is literally on the otherside of I-4, which offers restaurant, shopping, and nightlife. The resort is close to Disneyworld and a 10 minute drive to Universal Studio, Sea World, and Wet N' Wild. On the next exit from WorldQuest going east on I-4 is the famous Premium Outlet where you can save alot on high end designers and treated to an amazing shopping experience. My tip to all vacationer is to book your reservation on their website www.worldquestorlando.com. It was less than booking it on Expedia, Travelocity, or other travel sites. Also, rooms that may not be available on the travel sites is actually available on the home site for Worldquest. However, booking on the weekends can fill up quickly as we saw the place increase with guests by Saturday. The price for a 3 bedroom condo at the time of booking was $159 a night versus almost $200 when compared with Expedia and Travelocity for a 2 bedroom condo at Worldquest. We definately had a great time in Orlando during our trip in July '08 and would have never accomplished this without the great value, friendly employees, and proximity to the parks from Worldquest Resort.

Plenty of cushioned chaise lounges and a tiki bar with a limited but satisfactory food and drink menu. We had the continental breakfast each morning at the clubhouse. It was always fairly crowded, but they did a great job keeping the food coming. This was a big savings for us with 2 adults and 5 kids! The unit had laundry facilities and they even provided detergent. The only minor detail that could have been better was the A/C.

I have to say it was the most quiet and peaceful location I've ever stayed in Orlando - ESPECIALLY in view of the popular vacation week. Instead of taking time here to reiterate all the positive reviews I read before me (and agree to all), I thought I'd provide some information not mentioned in the previous reviews. You should be aware that WQ provides BOTH $free$ internet access using an internet cable (if you have your own laptop) and TV Internet Access (for a fee). Don't confuse the two. When you check in, your room key envelope indicates an automatic daily charge of $11.95 Resort Fee in addition to your room fee. This includes daily delivery of the USA Today Newspaper, Internet access for your own laptop, all local calls, use of fitness center, in-room coffee supplies, one fax per day, daily transportation to Disney and continental breakfast. Personally I think that's a great deal for basically $12/day in addion to the already inexpensive daily room rates! I also highly recommend your asking for Building 1 or 2 upon checkin (or even see if you can pre-reserve before arrival!). Those buildings are the closest to the pool area. I included with my review, a picture of their site map - indicating how the resort is layed out. I was lucky enough to stay in Unit 107 - PERFECT location and I will ask for again when I return! The Security Gate always had a guard every time I came in and out - and I was on the go every day as I was in Orlando on business. I always used the Marriott Towers and the Nickelodeon hotels as landmarks when finding my way back. Another outstanding feature I personally appreciated - was the many many electrical outlets in the unit. Something that was quite useful for me with all my business PDAs etc, but I'm sure would be helpful for families trying to recharge multiple cell phones, digital cameras and video cams!!! Air conditioning worked perfectly!! Kids will also get a kick out of all the little geccos (mini-lizards) sunbathing around the resort. Completely harmless creatures but are found EVERYWHERE in Florida! I even had a mommy racoon waddle past my screened porch one night with a little baby close behind! In closing, I simply don't understand what some of the fuss is about with some of the previous reviews.

We were not within easy walking distance of the pool this time--buildings 1-4 are pretty much the only ones that are. No construction this time, though that may be temporary (a lot more buildings are planned). The free breakfast was improved from last time--they listened to feedback and spread the food and toasters out more. The crowd was bigger too both for breakfast and in the pool, but still quite reasonable. Parking was ample, even near the pool entrance. I got no calls trying to sell me a timeshare, which surprised me. The location is excellent for Disney--literally a 2 minute drive to Epcot. They improved the sign on International Drive S a little since last year, but it is still hard to see.

The pool and hot tub were clean and fairly large and had nice chairs/tables/umbrellas and generally plenty of towels. The one disappointment was the unpredictable hours of the 'Tiki Bar' which we found closed around seven - and as the parents of 2 teens after a long day at the park we really needed a cocktail! The next evening we brought our own drinks to the pool and nobody bothered us. The 'Fitness Center' is pretty non-existent, with only a few cardio machines and basic free-weights. We also had trouble with wireless internet service which was down during our entire trip. The amenities of the suites were great. There were full kitchens including large fridge, stove, microwave, toaster, coffee maker, dishwasher, garbage disposal, dishes / silverware / cookware / glasses, washer/dryer.

Hopefully if we return we would like to see more/expanded dining options on the premises, a larger fitness center, better internet service and possibly a shortcut from further buildings to the pool area.

However, before you book your stay, you should realize that this is not a typical hotel. You won't find a doorman, a bellhop, or a concierge on the premises as you would for a nice hotel. There is no real on-site restaurant, unless you count the tiki bar and the continental breakfast. If you're looking for a full-service hotel, you should look into other choices. With that out of the way, let me explain the main reason you would want to stay at WorldQuest: the rooms. No, wait, that's incorrect - they're really condos, and they're large and beautiful. My family of four stayed here once before in a two bedroom unit; it had a full kitchen, a generous living/dining area, two relatively spacious bedrooms, and two full bathrooms. The master bath had both a stand-up shower and a whirlpool tub. Everything was modern, well-constructed, and tastefully appointed. This time we also booked a two bedroom unit, but since our room was not ready by check-in, they upgraded us to a three bedroom unit at the same cost. Just as beautiful, but even more spacious with three full bathrooms as well. The units even have a washer and dryer in case you need to do a load of clothes, and the kitchen cabinets and drawers have all the dishes and utensils you'll need. Each bedroom has its own television, and the living room had a nice flat-panel TV. Housekeeping did an excellent job each day - the place was always immaculate when we returned, and any used items (shampoo, etc.) were replenished on a daily basis. The resort has a small fitness room, with two treadmills, two elliptical trainers, an exercise bike, and free weights (dumbbells in various sizes). Also in the fitness room you'll find complimentary towels, and each exercise machine has a small video screen with basic cable. You have to plug headphones in to listen to the programs, but those are also supplied in the room (in sealed packages, so I would assume they're sanitary). The pool area is nice, with a tiki bar that serves drinks, snacks and sandwiches I believe, and a separate whirlpool. The pool itself is large, with fountain-type jets shooting out from the sides. Other than that, it's rather plain - don't look for water slides here. For that you would want the Nickelodeon hotel, which is across the street. In the morning there is a complimentary continental breakfast in a small dining area near the \"lobby\" (or rather, the rather small area where you check in). Breakfast consists of cold cereals, milk, coffee, bagels, danishes, and fruit if you get there early. Rooms have complimentary internet access; though I couldn't seem to get the wireless to work, the room did have an ethernet cord and a data plug. Once I plugged in the cord to my laptop, no problem. Oh, one other thing - did I say all of this was complimentary? Well, sort of. Be aware that there is a $12 a day resort fee added on to your rate (it is not included in the advertised rate). Location is another benefit of this resort. Disney parks are extremely close - you just have to study the map a little to make sure you don't get lost. I would estimate it's only about 10 minutes to any of the Disney parks, and maybe 15-20 to Universal. The resort offers a bus to some of the parks, but we did not use this service, as it forces you to adhere to the bus schedule. So, here are my final thoughts. We've stayed at many of the Disney resorts (from value to deluxe), and while you get the nice Disney service and a themed pool, the rooms are generally on the small side. We always end up spending our days in the parks anyhow, so the themed pool never really was a big attraction. For the same amount of money (or less), you can get a huge condo that is a hundred times nicer than a Disney room. I would definitely stay at the WorldQuest resort again - I love the space and comfort after coming back from a long day at the parks.", "Date": "June 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Murfreesboro, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cJust Getting Better\u201d", "Author": "Blueboro", "ReviewID": "UR17002736", "Content": "This was our 2nd stay at Worldquest.

No problems and a 5 minute ride home from the parks every night from then on. Secondly, I will admit that I am picky and kind of a snob about where I stay on vacation and I have to say that this place is incredible for the money. I don't know how they can afford it. We booked a 3BR/3BA for $219 a night and I thought even that sounded too good to be true, but went with it because we were traveling with a group and needed the space and because of the good reviews. A few weeks after I booked, I got a random email from the resort advertising a lower rate. I thought I had missed out since I had already booked at the higher rate, but when I called, they cheerfully gave me the promo rate of $149 a night!

Just beware the labyrinth-like Disney roads! - When we stayed (first 2 week of April '08) there were no queues, no trouble, no noise whatsoever. There were plenty of free sun loungers and free towels around the quiet, heated pool. - The condo was the cleanest, brightest, most modern and spacious I have ever stayed in. At no time were we ever asked if we'd like to purchase one. - Our condo was serviced every day; bins emptied, beds made, towels replaced, dishwasher loaded /started and extra detergent left for the dishwasher and the washing machine.

This place was the perfect place for our family. The resort is really beautiful. The rooms are modern (think sparkling granite countertops) and clean. The minute we walked in we knew we had scored. We stayed in a three-bedroom unit on the top floor. Each bedroom had a TV and the living room had an LCD tv with DVD player, which was fun to come back to after all day on our feet at the parks. The master bath was enormous and very luxurious with nice robes, a seperate shower , dual sinks and large jetted tub.. There was also a secondary bath, which was also very nice. I've read some of the issues with housekeeping, but honestly I don't get it. Their housekpeeing services are made clear, signs were in our room indicating what was included. I think this point is all about expectations. If you're expecting standard hotel housekeeping, then yes you'll be disappointed. Each day they never failed to remove the trash, make our beds, replace our towels, replace the toiletries, replace the laundry detergent (if you used it) and put the dirty dishes in the dish washer so we'd come home to clean dishes. I thought this was plenty adequate housekeeping, so I really don't know what all the fuss is about. I also never once smelled smoke while here, and we're very sensitive to smoke. The main advice I would give is to stay on a high floor, the top floor if you can. I can see how there might be some noise issues with folks passing by your room or even overhead foot traffic from other condos. We were in a corner on the top floor and never heard a thing (and I'm a really light sleeper). The pool area was fabulous, what I would expect at a nice resort. This place is perfect for a Disneyworld vacation. It's literally a 4-minute drive to Disney World, so don't even bother staying on-campus. Stay here for a fraction of the price. Our Disneyworld vacation was better than we could have imagined. And honestly I think our choice of accommodation had a lot to do with it. Having so much space allowed everyone to spread out and relax; we weren't on top of each other. All three of my children got plenty of sleep and so did we since everyone was spread out among three bedrooms. No crankies on this trip! And aside from the space it was a really beautiful place.

People smoke in the rooms (there are even ashtrays in the rooms), at the pool, in the pool, at the bar in the pool area - just about everywhere. Many times people were smoking in plain sight of Worldquest employees and nothing is said. It is completely unfair to guests who pick the accomdations based on the non-smoking policy. We could not even sit out on our screened porch at night because the people below us smoked like chimneys and the smoke came up and filled our porch and room.

After reading some reviews I was a little nervous of what we would find, but we were very pleasantly surprised. Firstly location - from previous reviews, I was prepared to have trouble finding the property, but called reception on the way and was given very good directions. The hotel is across from the Nickelodeon Hotel, which is a huge and very easy to spot landmark - you really can't miss it - so I don't understand why people have any problems getting to World Quest. Parking is free. The property is very new and the neighbouring rooms to ours were not yet let out (still being furnished). We were in building 6, which is one of the furthest from the reception / breakfast area and the swimming pool. But we are not talking that far - you certainly do not need a car to get to the pool - it's a 5 minute walk along a completely flat path! There are towels provided at the pool, so you don't even have to carry anything with you! There was plenty of space for the 4 of us to spread out, a well fitted out kitchen, 2 bedrooms (master suite and twin room for the children) 2 bathrooms (huge master en-suite), living room, dining area, terrace - and in-room laundry facilities (including free detergent). The room had a safe, and we did not have any problem with valuables - just locked them away as you would always do in a hotel. The free continental breakfast was good - certainly adequate for our needs - cereal, toast, pastries, apples, oranges, juice, coffee. It was a bit crowded at peak times, but you could sit outside by the pool with your food which was a nice alternative to the rather more squashed indoor area. There was usually plenty of food available, but it was disappointing on our last day to see a family stocking up from the buffet with enough bread, fruit etc to feed an army - literally bags of fruit and loaves of bread being carried out to their car - such greediness isn't in the spirit of the complementary breakfast and spoils it for everyone. The pool area and sun beds were nice - a good way to relax after a day at the parks. The gym was small but adequate.

After reading all of the reviews I was a little nervous but was hoping for the best! I can see why people have problems finding the resort. You must turn at the Nickelodeon hotel. It doesn't look like a place to turn onto a street because it looks more like an entrance to Nickelodeon or something else. If you miss the turn you will end up in Disney and can't turn around for quite a while. We had been to Disney before and were familiar with the area so we never had a problem, but they should have a better sign up. However, you are very close to the disney entrance, within a mile which is great when you are going back and forth. We arrived at the resort at 4pm, and had to wait about 25 minutes to check in. The woman checking everyone in was alone and was also answering phones, she was going crazy jumping back and forth between the phone and people checking in. When I reached the front she was very pleasant, but informed me that housekeeping was behind schedule and didn't have rooms ready yet, even though check in is at 3pm. She found us a 3 bedroom and we went off to find the room. I had specifically asked for a 3 bdrm/3bth and wanted to be close to the clubhouse. However, our room was a 3bdrm/2bth in building 5 not close at all to the clubhouse or pool. You had to drive to get to them. I called the front desk and she told me that when you book the 3 bdrm you aren't guaranteed the 3bth, you only get it if it's available at check in. We really needed it with 2 teenagers and a tween! The woman at the front desk was polite and said she did have one available and would move us to building 2. Much better! The pool was right behind us, we could walk to the clubhouse for breakfast and the fitness center was very close. The fitness center isn't big but was very nice, had great equipment and each piece of equipment had its own tv built in. After settling in, we did notice that the door to our patio would not lock. We called the front desk and they sent someone to fix it. They sent someone immediately which was great since it was already night time. The next day we realized we couldn't get the lamps to turn on in the living room so again we called and someone came to fix them for us. Later that day we had problems with the lamp in the bedroom with the 2 twin beds and someone came right away to fix that. Some type of faulty switch. Although they came quickly and they were minor problems, it was a little frustrating to have to keep calling them to fix things. The room itself was nice. The three bedrooms were spacious & clean as well as the three bathrooms. The beds were very comfortable. The tile floors were cold and somewhat sticky, which we really disliked. The tv remote in the living room didn't work and we couldn't find one for my daughter who was in the third bedroom. The showers had plenty of hot water, but they don't drain well. All three showers in all three of our bathrooms filled up to your ankles or higher as you showered. The kitchen was fully equipped, although our refrigerator door didn't close well and you had to be sure to push it closed and hold it to make sure it stayed closed before walking away. We could have called the front desk about some of these things, but we had already called three other times as mentioned above so we didn't want to bother. Besides we weren't in the room that much. Housekeeping came and made the beds, gave you new towels and loaded the diswasher and took your garbage each day. One day we were there when they came (about 4:00pm), they just come in and clean and do what they need to do with you there. The pool was very nice and my daughter (10) loved it so much. It was a bit chilly this last week so she didn't get to go in much. It says it's heated but it still felt very cold to us! The tiki bar was good and the guy making the drinks was very nice, but his computer kept breaking down and he was working alone, so it took him 15 minutes to get me 2 drinks. The resort has a gated entrance, however, my husband and I noticed that no one was there when we came in at night, any night we were there. Isn't night time when you want someone there? The gate was just left opened when no attendant was present, strange. The continental breakfast was okay, but the area is very small. They had cereal, juice, coffee, bagels, danishes, & muffins. All in all we had a good visit, but we were a little disappointed with all the problems we encountered. They were little problems but when you are on vacation you don't want to have inconveniences like that, there are enough of those at home!

We chose World Quest Resort due to it proximity to the Disney World Parks and it ability to easily accommodate a family of five. We also wanted a condo complex with a bit of a resort feel.

Stay USA managed the particular unit we had booked so I had to check-in at a location which was over three miles away from the resort. Check-in time was at 4pm and since I was an hour early the told me they could not check me in at 3pm without charging me for an additional day. I told them I would leave and come back at 4pm. When I got back I was informed that the computer was down and that they could not check me in until it came back up. After waiting in the lobby for an additional hour for the computer to begin working again they told me I would have to wait an additional hour since my room was not yet ready. Finally at 6pm I was given the key (singular) to the condo. I asked if I could have an additional key since there would be five people in the condo and I wanted to avoid a lockout situation. They told me that there was only one key per condo. I will say that upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised. Each of the three bedrooms had its own television and bathroom. The kitchen was well equipped with granite countertops and had a sufficient amount of utensils. The tile floors were nice, thought the carpets did seem a little dirty. The best feature was the patio door that could be retracted to expose the condo to a nicely screened patio. We also found the pool area to be a great feature. The pool was large and lightly heated for the cooler nights. There were ample towels and the hot tub was roomy. We also liked the Tiki Bar which had daily drink specials and a very reasonable happy hour. As predicted on our second to last day, the key was accidentally locked in the apartment when the wind blew the door shut. Unfortunately, the car keys were also trapped inside. We went to the front office and were told that they could not help us since our unit was run through a different management group. We called Stay USA and they told us it would be an hour before they could get someone out to us. After four additional phone calls and three additional hours a maintenance man finally showed up and asked us for our key to the unit so he could see what the problem was. We informed him that the key was locked in the unit and that was the problem. He looked at us dumbfounded and said if he had known that he would have brought the spare key. After an additional half hour of waiting he opened up the unit for us with the spare key. I called Stay USA the next morning to see if we could move our check-out from 10am to 10:30am. The told me that that would not be possible since they needed to get the room ready for the next guest. When I told them that I got the unit two hours late, could I get at least an half an hour of it back, the told me that policy required them to charge me one more day if I wanted to do that. All in all, it really is a lovely place. It is a great value for what you get and the pool is very nice and relaxing and not at all crowded.

I have to admit I was pretty thrilled at the price considering you can stay at the Disney resorts for well over that for a one-bedroom.

I mentioned that I wanted something closer to the pool and she found a spot in building 1 - which overlooked the pool. I was SO pleased! We had no complaints at all. The concierge helped us get tickets to Cirque (a must see) at Downtown Disney. They can also help you with Disney World tickets and many more. We rented a car so didn't use the shuttle.

We stocked up on water and oj and froze them to bring to the parks. It is not hard to find this hotel once you know it is right behind the HUGE Nick hotel. 5 minutes to Disney, and really close to a super walmart. As soon as you check in go to walmart and stock up. We cooked most meals and our kitchen was fully stocked. The pool is gorgeous and clean. We were in Building 2 , 2nd floor overlooking pool and hot tub. We experienced no construction noise or late night pool noise. One evening of 9 we had a loud group of people out on patio directly below our bedroom yelling and screaming we called the front desk twice and they sent security to rectify. One day our fridge shelf snapped out of place and the maintenance man came instantly and was very nice. Twice we had an issue with housekeeping once they never came and our garbage was overflowing and once they just came in while we were still there and didn't knock. Again in most condos you get no daily maid service and bring out your own garbage. The staff was great. We expected a computer to have access to and when we didn't they did our boarding passes for us the day before we left. The security gate staff knew us by day two and were very friendly!!

The problem is that Disney tries to hard to make finding your way around. They mark destinations, but often do not mark streets on their property.

We stayed in a three-bedroom, three-bath condo not directly overlooking the pool but almost. Other than a few nit-picky things that aren't worth mentioning, it was a wonderful stay. Very quiet at night, clean grounds, clean units, etc. Our last evening there were a couple of groups of quite rowdy college-aged kids there for some marching band festival or football game, and they were pretty out of control, frankly, but I attributed the situation to the fact that this property isn't very near to completion yet and seems to be experiencing typical growing pains. Although we didn't call and complain, I was surprised that nothing was done to address their behavior. But that was a very isolated event, and the rest of the stay was just wonderful. The free breakfast was good and saved us at least $40 a day, plus a lot of time. The pool is HUGE and clean and seemed to be freshwater and not chlorinated heavily. But VERY clean. Our unit was great, lots of hot water (we needed it with three girls), wonderfully equipped kitchen, always enough paper products. Check-in/check-out was effortless and quick, and the gatehouse guys were so sweet. The property is incredibly close to all the parks. One chilly day, we had time to leave MGM early evening, get back and fix pasta to go, change into warmer clothes, not really hurry and got back to MGM in time for the Fantasmic show that evening. I have read other reviews on this property that seem parallel to mine, only a couple bad ones. As a family of five, it's very difficult to find a good place to stay with enough space for us all to relax and not be tripping over each other, without paying a small fortune.

Upon arriving, the gates to enter were down and the guard gate apparently unoccupied. I pressed the call button....no answer. No guard and no answer, so I called the hotel and asked how can I get through the gate? About that time an older gentleman sheepishly poked his head out of the guard shack and proceeded to take down my information. Once in the lobby, I approached the desk and proceeded to check into our rooms (I was traveling with 3 other associates). The associate was by herself and began to check us in. The phone rang and she excused herself and took the call. Several minutes later she returned to complete our check-in.....that is until the phone rang again. Finally we had our two rooms and we headed to drop our luggage. My 2-bedroom suite was ok, however the 2 ladies we were traveling with were checked into a dirty room...dirty towels, dirty linens, etc. Of note is the 2 bedroom suite has one King bed and 2 twins...twin beds in a Resort? I called the Front Desk and explained what happened and was placed on hold.....for 10 minutes...until I eventually hung up and walked back down to the desk. Evidently if you call from your room you get put on hold, if you call from the outside you get serviced. I went back down to the desk and requested a new room and suggested it would be nice to have a 3-bedroom suite for the ladies since they were checked into a dirty room. This request was met with \"I can't do that without creating a whole new reservation\". I then asked to simply have a clean 2-bedroom suite and one was located.....in another building. I asked who the manager was the next morning and was told the desk associate would leave a note about the problem we experienced. The manager did call me back.....the next day at 2:53 PM. She offered to move us into another 2-bedroom suite....an odd gesture given the fact were already in a 2-bedroom suite. The next few days were met with no housekeeping service on one day, service on one day in which the towels were not replenished and no in-room coffee being replaced. Given the fact this resort charges a \"Resort\" fee, is it not too much to ask for a new coffee packet each day? The coffee pot sat half full for 3 days. Continental breakfast consisted of some pastries, bagels, Diet Pepsi and some other sodas.

Call the hotel directly and ask for specials! WorldQuest was a very economical solution, especially for a large group like ours (ie. 4 adults, 2 kids). Staying on Disney property would have bankrupted us so the value is definitely there. The three bedroom condo was spacious and well appointed. The property is newer, nice and has decent amenities. Our stay overall was satisfactory, however this resort fails on delivering on the small details. The devil is in the details! -When we checked in at midnight the room they sent us to had not been made up. The next room they sent us to was the same. And the third. We did not end up in our eventual room until 1:30am after a 14 hour drive that day. To add to the fun, the elevator on our buidling wasn't working and we had to haul luggage for 6 up 4 flights of stairs. Not fun. -Housekeeping did not thoroughly clean the rooms to a hotel standard. All they did was make the bed and replace towels. Any dirt that would accumulate in sinks, floors, carpet would just sit there until we cleaned it ourselves. -Many things in the room would not work. Room safe didn't work and needed engineering help. Batteries were dead in one TV remote and also on the keyboard for internet -We were missing basic kitchen items like a frying plan, towels, and other items. They were supplied after we called but it was an inconvenience nonetheless. -Cleanliness of the resort was spotty. For instance, the day after we arrived we noticed that someone spilled some Fruit Loops cereal in front of the entrance door in the landscaped area. We're talking like 8-10 pieces of cereal - hard to miss. It was obvious. 10 days later on our departure they were still there. It became a running joke when we would go for breakfast - \"Are the fruit loops still there?\" There are some positives: -The pool and spa are very nice and spacious. Contrary to another review I can assure you the pool is heated. -The Contintenal Brkft was fine and the fridge full of drinks was good to load up on cold water before heading out for the day. -Contrary to some other reviews I found the staff friendly and genuine when it came to addressing concerns. -If you are doing DIsney World the location is very convenient. You can drive to the themeparks from WQ in no time, even faster than most hotels on Disney Property. Plus the roads surrounding aren't very busy so there is no congestion. Everything you need is a couple of minute drive on US-192. You need a car as nothing is walking distance.

The 3 bedroom condo was very nice, however it had no toilet paper and the jacuzzi jet tub did not work . Housekeeping also only came once during our 3-night stay and when they finally came they missed a ton of things (including giving us toilet paper). The heated pool was also not heated which made swimming in the evening after Disney impossible this time of year. We complained to the front desk about these things, but the general attitude of all was they could care less. We also tried to utilize the concierge for things to do besides Disney. The concierge barely knew anything (I knew more from my own research before we came). So if you are looking for a lot of room and a newer place to stay - it is nice in that regard, as long as you don't expect anything from the staff. As a side note, this hotel faces I-4, so expect to hear the traffic unless you turn on a fan!", "Date": "November 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cA very enjoyable resort\u201d", "Author": "SydneyHat", "ReviewID": "UR10632735", "Content": "My wife and two kids (8 & 11) had traveled from France to Orlando via Philadelphia.

We stayed in a 3bdrm, 2bathroom. After reading all of the amazing reviews, I think I had my sights set a little high. It is not a sparkly brand-new fantasy-land. It is, however, a very nice, very functional alternative to overpriced, undersized hotel rooms! We (a family of 5) enjoyed the space that this resort gave us. The Master bdrm and bathroom were huge. The other two bedrooms (one queen, one with twins) were not large rooms, but they were great for the kids to either play some toys or watch cartoons. The king Bed in the Master was very comfortable and the room was huge! The Jacuzzi tub was enjoyed by all (plenty of hot water!) and the walk-in shower had alot of space and pressure. The kitchen was well equipped, right down to the corkscrew, cutting, board and bottle opener. Coffee packets, both decaf and regular, were supplied daily. Kitchen sponges. dish cloths, dish soap, and dishwasher soap was also supplied. The only downside to the kitchen was the colony of ants that resided on our counter, which was taken care of after a phone call to the front desk. (We were offered another room, but didn't see the need to move.) The Dining area was very tastefully decorated and served the 5 of us nicely. The Living Room was comfortable. However, another easy chair would have been nice. It was a tight fit for five on one couch and one easy chair. Overall, the resort was quiet (no construction noise) and well run. The pool area was huge, clean and nearly deserted. We sometimes had the whole area all to ourselves. The supplied breakfast was adequate. Muffins, Cereals, Danishes, Cinnamon Knots along with free juice, milk and pop. Chips and Salsa in the afternoon, and Brownies, cookies, or cupcakes in the evening. We were incredibly close to DisneyWorld, as well as many restaurants and shopping. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The common areas were always kept very clean, as were the grounds. The downsides were outrageous long distance charges, internet access the wasn't accessible, and a tv remote that had a mind of it's own. None of these were unbearable. We would definitely stay here again.

Like other reviewers, we found it challenging to find at first, but once we found it, it's actually easy. The resort is off the main roads so use the Marriot and the Nickelodeon Hotel as your landmarks. The road that leads to Nickelodeon will lead you to the WorldQuest. WorldQuest is a gated community, very nice indeed. Check-in was easy, no wait and great service. Our room was a three bedroom, three bath condo which was excellent for our party. My mother-in-law basically had her own wing and we had the other (master bedroom suite) with a large bathroom and jacuzzi tub. The 1300 SF space with a screened in porch sure beat the usual (even upscale) hotel rooms. We had no problems whatsoever. While we would have preferred larger bath towels; brighter lighting in the rooms; and breakfast available after 9:30, but no matter - our stay was wonderful. Pool was really beautiful excellent, Jacuzzi really nice - never crowded. The resort is close to everything. The staff was very friendly; the rooms are spacious and clean. The pool is terrific- we enjoyed it day and night. The morning continental breakfast saved us time and money. The complex is quiet; a wonderful place to relax away from the crowds and noise of the parks. In the lobby's breakfast/snack area there is a refrigerator stocked with complimentary juice, milk and soda - how nice! WorlQuest does not have activities, no kid's pool (we have no children but for those who do...), no restaurants, no game room, no business center, etc. That was fine for us, but for those who may want more, it's good to know what is available. There was really nothing to do but relax by the pool or in your unit and enjoy the comfortable space.

We are in our 50's & 60's and several have traveled extensively. We unanimously agreed that this is the nicest place we have ever stayed. We reserved a two bedroom unit but were upgraded to a three bedroom upon arrival as there were no two bedrooms available. The unit was roomy, clean and had three bathrooms...what more could four women want!!! Everything about this resort hotel was exactly as others have described it. The pool was exceptionally clean and was never crowded. The front desk personnel were friendly and helpful, and having rented other condo units, it was very, very nice to have daily housekeeping service. Shampoo, conditioner & lotion was provided in all bathrooms and the hotel provided one package of laundry detergent, fabric softener and dishwasher detergent. More was available at the small store in the clubhouse; however, we did not purchase any. I was told the price was only $1. We had an issue with one of the bathroom showers and it was promptly repaired. This place really knows about customer service! We were also very pleased with the continental breakfast. Each morning bagels, muffins, pastries, cinnamon rolls, cereal and fruit were available, as well as coffee, an assortment of teas, milk and orange juice. Each morning one of us would go to the clubhouse and bring back enough food for all of us. Additionally, the refrigerator in the clubhouse is always stocked with sodas, milk and juice and you can freely choose whatever you want whenever you want. We never checked out the afternoon snack but went down several evenings for the great brownies and cookies and decaf coffee which we brought back to the unit to enjoy. As previously mentioned, WorldQuest is very close to Disney property...just about 5 minutes from the Disney welcoming arch and, at the furthest distance, probably 15 minutes to Animal Kingdom. Getting to the parks was never a problem; however, getting back to WorldQuest always proved challenging. It seemed we hardly ever wound up back on Rt 536. I was glad I had been to the area many times before and knew numerous roads. I had checked out WorldQuest on Google Earth and knew exactly where the resort was, so we had no problem locating it initially. We always used the Nickolodean Resort as our landmark.

Our family of 4 (2 teens) had a 2-room condo. It was the BEST we have ever stayed at. Everything was spotlessly clean and spacious. We loved the patio that overlooked the pool. There was plenty of room for everyone to have their own space. The teens liked having their own room and tv. The Master bedroom was perfect. The beds where comfy and there was more than enough storage throughout for all of our stuff. Loved, loved, loved, having the washer and dryer. So nice to not have to bring a bunch of dirties home. My husband thought we had 2 lights out in the bathroom. I called the front desk and someone was there within 15 min. It turned out my husband didn't realize the switch was under a towel. The tile floors in the main areas made it neccessary to turn the tv up as there was a small echo. We found that we had plenty of dishes. The water tasted bad, so we bought ice got bottled water from the kitchenette in the Clubhouse. The room staff was super about cleaning up each day. The front desk staff where very professional. The internet was down when we where there and they offered their computers for my daughter to submit her summer reading assignment. The guard at the front gate was very friendly and recognized us after the first day. The morning buffet is served out of the kitchenette in the Clubhouse. This is a VERY small room, so it resulted in a bottleneck of families getting their breakfast. I suggested that they set up the breakfast in the eating area in my survey. We only went to the afternoon snacks once, there was some nacho chips and salsa. My kids went to the eveing snacks twice, and there was cookies and brownies. Oh, a little advice, when you go to the pool, check your chair. they don't lay the chairs flat at night and condensation pools in the bend of the chair. If you are dressed, this results in a wet tush! (My dh's experience.) The pool is spotless, warm and well lit. We met some very nice people from all over. Orlando is very international with tourists. Each day at breakfast, we would try to figure out the languages we heard. All the local things where very close to the hotel, just give yourself a few extra minutes to get to Disney & Sea World because the Hwy. is ALWAYS busy! At this time of year, there is almost always a mid-afternoon shower. We usually went out in the am, afternoon at the pool, and if there was thunder, went up to the room for a bit.. The only solicitation from the hotel to purchase was a letter on the Master bedroom bed. I was very relieved because I have heard horror stories about some timeshare sales pitches. What you get for the $$$ is so good, I would come back again and agan to WorldQuest. This is SO much better than a hotel room.
