My wife and I have been traveling for more than 25 years and we have stayed at other hotels and they dont even come close to Hampton Inn in value,quality,and customer satisfaction. Our recent stay on April 23-25th was just as we would have expected very friendly staff. I would like to mention that the young lady at the front desk Sheila that works in the afternoon or evening shift was very helpful in recommendations for local dining as well as looking up local businesses for my needs. I also noticed the young lady even could greet guests by their own name as well and I was very impressed with that showing a personal touch that you dont see in this fast paced world that we live in.

I explained to them that the payment had already been completed and I showed them the extract of my bank account, which included the payment of the hotel.

I would recommend this place in a heartbeat to friends and family. The shuttle service to the Disney is great too because it is the last on the route into the park and the first one to drop off on the way back at night! Took approx. 20 minutes in the minutes and only 10 at night to get home. During the first week of January there are only 2 shuttles in the morning and 2 in the evenings. The only other compliment was that the jacuzzi was just slightly warm, not hot. At least not when we attempted to use it in the evenings after a long day on our feet in the parks.

Great to have free Wi-Fi and computers to access for airline check in and print boarding passes without being charged for printing. One great point to this hotel is it is very close to all parks and there are probably 30 restaurants in the area. You can walk but since we did MILES at the parks we drove. We ate a perkins and Olive Garden which were both great service with the amount of people in the restaurants at 9pm. Also 2 grocery stores within 1/2 mile of the hotel.

When we got to the next room a few floors up we could see that the carpet had big squares cut out and crudely replaced (looked like someone was trying to fumigate under the carpeting) The next day at check out we asked to speak to a manager and for a discount since we were put out.

We booked the hotel via Hilton Honors web site. The web site indicated that this was one of the few hotels that had a single room for five people for six days of stay. The price was high since we requested a room for five. When we arrived, the front desk person name Chris told us that the room could only hold four people and they did not have any movable bed to be added to our room. I showed him the print out of our reservation that stated we had five people, he said that was the problem of the Hilton Honors web site, and the hotel had nothing to do with that. I asked for my options, he contacted the hotel manager. The hotel manager told Chris that I could pay for another room for 4 days. As the hotel was sold out for the last two days of our stay, he said that he would give me a movable bed for the last two days of our stay. As I don't have any other options, I had to pay an extra $449.96 for an additional room for four nights. After checked into our rooms, we found out that the fridges on both rooms were very noisy. We had to unplug them in order to sleep. Other than that, the hotel facilities are similar to other Hampton Inns. We checked out the additional room after the fourth night and expected to see a movable bed in our other room after we come back from the park. To our surprise, when we came back near mid-night, we did not see the movable bed in our room. When my wife came to the front desk to ask about it, she was directed to the telephone to talk to the hotel manager. The manager told my wife that there is nothing the hotel can do. The only option for us was to check out of the hotel and go to somewhere else. This was at 12:30 am in the night and my two kids were already sleeping. My wife told him that if we were forced to check out at this late hour, we would have to sleep in the hotel lobby, and we might have to call the police to help us find a temporary shelter.

The pillows used to be high-quality, a choice of \"firm\" \"medium or soft written on them from the same manufacturer.

Not only was it uncomfortable, but it would slide away from the base mattress, even if you just sat on it. The duvet was not cleaned well and the baseboard cover was this old and cheap gold fabric. The sheets were yellowed and worn looking and not crisp. Even the TV was old and cheap, looking like something out of 1970. I know I keep mentioning how cheap everything is, because that's how to best describe it. The owners of this hotel intentionally went cheap, sacrificing quality and comfort in order to make a few more bucks out of their customers.

I wanted to discuss this first to let people know it's still possible to stay here and do other things! The location is good. It's great for the theme parks I mentioned above (I think the hotel has shuttles to these places, but not sure). It was less than 10 minutes by car to each golf course we played (Shingle Creek and Marriott Grande Pines). It is walking distance to a fair amount of restaurants, but your choices are somewhat limited. I would say it was about 0.5 miles to the first business center cluster, and about another 0.4 miles to the intersection of Palm Parkway and HWY 535. I give a word of caution to those walking: it's fairly dark walking at night because there are little or no street lamps, so walk with another person (or in a group). There are sidewalks on both sides of the road, but just be careful. Even though you are in a highly populated tourist area for Disney, you never know what type of people are out and about. The room was clean and well kept, and the hotel overall was also clean. The room has a mini fridge, a wall AC unit (a bit noisy), and an old rear projection TV. It's rare to find these in hotels today, so I was disappointed with this. No, I wasn't here to watch TV, but it's also nice to have a nice TV to watch when you are settling down for bed. We smelled bug spray multiple times during our stay in the hotel: first in the elevator and once in one of the hallways. I guess it is Florida, and there are bugs, but you really don't want to walk around and smell that. I guess you also don't want bugs crawling around either? The hotel offers free parking (the lot fills up pretty nicely at night), free wireless internet, and free on site breakfast. The breakfast is your typical Hampton Inn spread, but their waffle maker produces Mickey Mouse Ear waffles for the kids. I am sure they enjoy it. The hotel elevators are VERY slow. My biggest problem was with security. I walked out the rear door of the hotel one morning and found it propped open with a piece of wood, allowing anyone without a hotel door key to \"come on in\". This is a pretty big security issue, and thus I can't really recommend the hotel. I wouldn't bring my wife and kid here because of it. I reported this to the front desk. The reply was the doors are checked around midnight and there was a uniformed guard walking the property. Well, I hope they check the doors more often than that. Also, I didn't see a guard once while on the property. For $88/night, it's a good deal for the location and what you get. I hope they work on their security a bit.

Our family planner that got the hotel for us was assured we would have a pleasant time in the lobby. We had a \"pizza\" get together and started to play cards.

The only noise was the slamming doors from inconsiderate neighbors. Laundry can be done at the Extended Stay next door when you show your room key. I used the advanced pay option so the rooms were paid for and check out was easy. The staff was friendly and professional. The breakfast included bagels, muffins, make your own waffles, eggs (imitation), sausage, french toast sticks, cereal, yogurt, fruit, and juices. The juices were watery but overall I thought the breakfast was good. We had our own transportation so we didn't use the hotel Shuttle to Disney World. It was really easy to navigate to all of our destinations. If you have your own transportation, there are lots of restaurants that are a few minutes drive away. There is a Pizza Hut and a small shopping center with a couple restaurants on the same street as the hotel. Of course driving past these locations, they look close to the hotel but an actual walk may not seem so short (I didn't try it). One day, I took a taxi from Seaworld b/c I needed to come back to the hotel earlier than the rest of my family and the cost was $10 one way (not incl. tip). I liked this hotel and would stay again based on the value, location, and the cleanliness of the facility.", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Experience\u201d", "Author": "-Traveller4Life-82", "ReviewID": "UR69909733", "Content": "This hotel was just Great!

We really liked this hotel and considered staying for our entire 5 nights at Disney but glad we didn't. We liked our room, we thought the staff was the best and the price was awesome! Even after tax, we only paid $88.88 - the cheapest hotel of our 9 day trip - we drove to DisneyWorld and stayed at 4 Hampton Inns along the way & 4 nights at a Disney Resort. It really, really is a great deal to stay here & be so close to Disney. However, there were two reasons why we are glad we didn't stay here the remaining 4 nights at Disney. We stayed here because we wanted 5 nights at a Disney Resort Hotel but they were booked and we could only get in for 4 nights - so we stayed at this Hampton Inn before moving onto the Disney Resort Hotel. The reason we are glad we stayed at the Disney Resort Hotel was for the convenience of the shuttle buses - our Disney Resort Hotel had different shuttle buses going to ALL the different Disney Parks - most leaving every 30 minutes from early morning to past midnight. This was amazing convenient! This Hampton Inn has a shuttle bus that goes to Epcot only & only twice a day - like 8:30 am and 12:30pm - so if you miss it, you are out of luck. Plus they have only one return time - it was something like 5:45pm which you need a reservation for. We wanted to stay late to see the Epcot fireworks and if we used the Hampton shuttle, we couldn't have done that. Once at Epcot - if you wanted to go to Magic Kingdom you'd have to leave Epcot on a monorail to a transportation center then take another monorail to Magic Kingdom - very time consuming. I notice another guest complained about the shuttle service from Hampton and I also noticed that the management frequently responds to guest comments on tripadvisor so I'm sure they'll be reading this review. The management responded to the other guest's review by saying \"Free Shuttle to parks: Disney controls where they allow such shuttle services to drop off guests. Once at Epcot guests can take Disney's own internal shuttles to any park you want.\" So in the hotel's defense, I could see how limited they are due to Disney's rules but it is still not guest friendly. But I did think of a great solution! IF guests at Hampton have a vehicle with them and do not need to use the shuttle, it is still cheaper to stay at the Hampton Inn & drive to the Disney Park of your choice & pay $15 to park there - with direct access to the park you are visiting instead of paying $$$ to stay at a Disney Resort Hotel like we did. We thought of this only after we moved to the Disney Resort Hotel so we could have access to more direct shuttles. The second reason I didn't like this Hampton Inn was the awful breakfast! Out of 8 hotel breakfasts on our trip - this was the worst! Only 3 choices of cereal from a dispenser - which was not labeled - were those regular cheerios or honey nut cheerios?? Milk from a dispenser. No fresh fruit, but cut up fruit chunks served in a bowl. Their fruit chunks looked spoiled. I can say this because the night before we stayed at a Hampton Inn in Mobile, AL which had an amazing breakfast serving the same cut fruit chucks which looked like fruit and tasted good. This Hampton\u2019s fruit looked pale and awful and not like fruit. They had 1 choice of muffins along with a bread selection to toast. Their \"hot\" breakfast had 3 choices - none were hot. In fact, they had an egg dish topped with shredded cheese that was so cold, the cheese wasn't even melted. And lastly - they had 1 and only 1 waffle maker for tons and tons of guests. The line to a make a waffle was very long & to make it worse - each person was making 3-4 waffles which took extra time. I don't blame them for making waffles for their entire family at the same time. I waited and waited and finally got to cook my waffle, shaped like Mickey Mouse. The waffle tasted awful - like cardboard. I never use syrup on pancakes or waffles and had to for this waffle since it tasted so awful. However, again - in the hotel's defense - I can understand why they don't offer more convenient breakfast foods - like choices of cereal boxes, milk cartons, fresh fruit, danishes, lots of muffins, lots of bread options, peanut butter or jelly. Because guests could pack an entire cooler with \"to-go\" options to eat later in the day at Disney. I've see that at other hotels - people grabbing food to go as they left to eat on their road trip. This is a great hotel, clean hotel, friendly staff, very close to Disney and a great deal for the money. If you can park at a Disney Park and not worry about the shuttle - do so - it's still a great deal. But don't count on a decent breakfast here.", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clearwater, FL", "Title": "\u201cLove this Hampton Inn!\u201d", "Author": "LydiaMKClearwater_FL", "ReviewID": "UR67899426", "Content": "We absoulutely love this hotel.

Not many places call within 15 minutes of check-in to see if the room was acceptable!", "Date": "November 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cSoccer moms staying for college tournament at Disney\u201d", "Author": "soccermome", "ReviewID": "UR48369515", "Content": "We found Hampton Inn/Orlando Lake Buena Vista to be over above our expectations. Our daughters were staying at a Disney Resort Hotel with their team and we found this Hampton Inn to be very convenient to their hotel, Wide World of Sports and any other Disney area we wished to travel to. Everything was within 10-15 minutes away. Not only was the price very affordable but the staff always courteous and willing to assist. Rooms were clean and whenever we asked for additional towels, etc our requests were taken care of promptly. Never having to worry about breakfast in the morning was another plus as well as the many restaurants in the neighboring area. We have stayed in many hotels with our soccer travels and would rate this Hampton Inn as one of the best. Truly a great find!!! Would stay again and hope to soon.", "Date": "November 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worldwide!", "Title": "\u201cDisney Delight\u201d", "Author": "StumpWorldwide", "ReviewID": "UR48360811", "Content": "Clean, great service.

Rates at the Hampton were much better than the Hilton rates, although a rental car was necessary to quickly move from one hotel to the other (it is a mile or more). The rooms, building, staff, and public areas were all at the usual high quality I expect from a Hapton Inn. Breakfast was OK, with some hot items and plenty of food. After 5 days it does seem a bit tired since there is no variation in the items. However, as breakfast is included in the price, and the cost of dining in the area is high, it is a great deal. There are plenty of chain restaurants nearby; unfortunately not much in the way of interesting non-chain places to get a feeling for the local culture. Overall, the price I paid (prepaid 5 days, about $75.50/night incl tax) was good and the quality was as expected for a Hampton Inn - very nice.", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hampton Inn Orlando/Lake Buena Vista", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d223017-Reviews-Hampton_Inn_Orlando_Lake_Buena_Vista-Orlando_Florida.html", "Price": "$85 - $152*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">8150 Palm Parkway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Orlando</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">32836</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515941", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/a3/a6/09/hampton-inn-orlando-lake.jpg"}}
