Three days later the DO charge my credit card for the full stay, even though we never stepped foot in the hotel and more importantly, had been promised they wouldn't. After emailing Julien at the hotel, he admitted to us that they had mistaken us with someone else who did not call to cancel, and has since refused to refund out money and has ignored an emails about this.

I agree that the shower floods the bathroom as the shower door only covers half but it didn't bother me and would be more of a concern fior the hotel as it would after time damage the flooring.

The Gabriel, by contrast, is for guests who can get quite enough bustling romance outside the hotel's doors. It's more like a pocket-sized spa resort than a city boutique, and the fact that it's located at the edge of the Marais, which makes for a fair bit of street life, whether by day or by night. A quiet room and a soothingly Zen sense of interior design both go a long way towards producing the desired restful reaction. There's more, if you want it, from organic food (and organic bath products) to detox-themed spa treatments. But most of us will find the mix of high style and luxe comfort to produce all the relaxation we could ask for. As is customary in Paris, the Gabriel can afford to opt out of certain services which the city at large is only too happy to provide - which is the long way of saying there's no restaurant because there's no need for one. This hotel offers a stylish respite from the life of the city, not a full-immersion twenty-four-hour experience. The contrast is the whole point - take part in the bustle by day, and unplug and detox by night.About Hotel Gabriel: Hotel Gabriel is a luxury boutique hotel in Paris from Axel Schoenert. It is located at the edge of the Marais. The hotel features a calming, zen atmosphere with detox spa treatments and organic products.

The hotel and rooms were very hip, impeccably clean and very comfortable, if small (although, no smaller than any other place I've stayed in Paris). Definitely tops were the bath products - wonderful! The location is not as \"in\" the Marais as I had envisioned but two metro lines are within 5 minutes walk and it was not more than a 20 minute walk to the Pompidou Centre and barely more to the Louvre via the Marais districts. There were a few downsides of which others have mentioned - I agree that style trumped practicality for the bathroom, as it flooded after each shower (granted of course I enjoy rather long luxurious showering). The wifi as well was sketchy but FREE so I let that slide a bit. I did not pay the 17 euros for breakfast - with Paris full of cute/delicious caf\u00c3\u00a9 I did not think it worth it. The staff were almost perfect, except for one staff member who continually gave sketchy directions and information regarding shop opening hours.

Only problem for us was the transfer from and to the airport and hotel, it appears to be rush hour every hour in Paris so the transfer time from Charles De Gaulle is around 50mins to an hour which was a bit long for us, however I am led to believe there is a quicker metro link, didn't fancy taking a suitcase on the metro however... Would definately stay again and recommend to anyone looking for an affordable buut chic Parissene Hotel. Also we stayed in Winter (December) and I am led to believe less tourists around at this time of year and the outdoor ice rink and christmas market near the Eiffel Tower and the decorations on the mains streets and cathedrals such as Notre Damn added a nice touch to the trip.

It looked gorgeous! The room was always very clean and we found the staff to be really helpful too, which surprised me, having in mind the stereotypes about the French attitude to the English! In the bathroom I think style may have won over practicality, as there was a lovely rain shower head, but with no door on the shower this meant the whole bathroom was flooded even from a quick wash. And they weren't generous enough with the towels so I was wringing them out and hoping they'd dry by the time we needed them again! I'd also suggest adding in tea making facilities - this is a pet hate of mine - and tea from the bar cost 5Euros. Top tip - turn left out the hotel and across the road is Cafe Jean, which does take away tea for approx 2Euros and has lots of tasty breakfast items and only a minute's walk away. They could also do with maybe an English language TV station, since they've gone to a lot of effort to incorporate a TV into the room it'd be good to be able to get some use from it for non-Francophones. We didn't have the breakfast because at 17E each we thought this was just too expensive. It's backfired on them somewhat - more reasonable prices on drinks and breakfast and we'd have had them everyday for convenience.

Which brings me to my upstairs neighbor......who, with heels on every night would walk the runway in her room. Or at least, that what it sounded like. None of this was hotels fault and I am sure if I called, they would have called my neighbor. Food: Did not opt for the buffet since there are French Cafes to be had. Many people did though. There are some treats in the room and though, not cheap, I went for some since I was hungry one night. I was later pleased it was at least a healthy bar. Housekeeping: Everyone nice. Pleasant.

My wife and I stayed here last week on our honeymoon and to be honest we both found it a big disappointment. We read a lot of reviews all saying how great this hotel was so decided to make a reservation. I emailed the hotel before our arrival saying that we were on our honeymoon and asking if they could do anything special for us. This is the reply i got - \"Thank you for your email and your interest in Hotel Gabriel Paris. We will of course do our very utmost to meet your requests. We will try and provide an upgrade. This I can not guarantee but we will certainly add some perks for you if we can not give you an upgrade\". Sounds great right?... The room we got was very standard and not an upgrade, or at least i hope not! Unfortunately we got none of the above things mentioned in the email and i had to actually ask the desk staff if they were going to do anything for us. Can't say i liked having to do that. It fealt cheeky, but if you don't ask you don't get in my opinion. In the end we did get a small bottle of cheap champagne. Ok, i can live with that as it's better than nothing, and the hotel were under no obligation to do anything for us ...and they didn't. The room we had was very small but it was nicely decorated and trendy looking. But hang on a minute ..where is the tea and coffee making facility? There wasn't anything at all except overpriced health snacks. I have never ever stayed at a hotel of this price level and not received these basic facilities. But ok, it's a health and wellbeing type hotel ... Now this is no exageration - i really have thought about this and what i came up with is that i have never stayed in a noisier hotel, and i have stayed in some noisy hotels. One of the reasons we booked at all is that the Hotel Gabriel was sold as relaxation hotel. Rooms were supposed to be quiet and peaceful. They are not ..well not the one we had anyway (202). We could hear a lot of noise from other guests - slamming doors and generally stomping about. The worst thing was that we were right next to the cleaner's closet. I had to go out on the first morning and ask the cleaner to oil the sqeaky door which had been going since 6.30am! Incredibly annoying. We never did get a peaceful nights sleep. Other people have mentioned the shower splashing onto the floor. Ours did that too, leaving soaking wet towels. On the plus side, the staff were friendly, as were the cleaners. There were some nice soaps and gels in the shower room. The whole place looked lovely and was in a nice quietish area just outside the Marais and near to the Oberkampf Metro station. If you don't fancy paying 17 euros for breakfast at the Gabriel there are loads of quality nearby places selling decent French breakfast. So there you go. Some might ask 'why did you not complain to staff at the time?' - well because i was on honeymoon and bacause i'm not really into that. But on here at least my review can give an account of our stay and others can make what they will of it. There seems to be a balance of good and bad. Maybe it depends on what room you have.

The neighborhood is quaint but not near anything of particular note. 2. I don't know why they call themselves a \"detox hotel.\" Other than some health bars on the refrigerator and some fitness books, there's nothing health or spa like about this place. It's more of a clean, modern bed and breakfast. 3. The noise level is relatively high with thin walls and doors and particularly with the maids, who are pleasant but loud. I was awakened fairly early every morning. They say it's soundproof because of the windows -- ironically, the surrounding area is pretty quiet so that's one place they probably don't need soundproofing. 4. The rooms are somewhat irregular which is okay, but at one point I got a room without a shower. The rooms and elevator are tiny, but I guess that is to be expected in Paris. 5.

There is also free wifi in the rooms which is good. The Hotel also has massage treatments etc but these weren't pushed on you, so you're not made to feel like you have to use them. The Hotels location is great, being 5 minute walk from Republique which is only 4 metro stops from Gar du Nord (where the Eurostar goes to), and from Republique you can travel all over paris easily. There are lots of restaurants and bars around the hotel but we went down to St Michel for a meal and a few drinks in the evening - there are some really nice restaurants and bars in this area. All in all, an excellant stay and I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Stay\u201d", "Author": "andream39", "ReviewID": "UR96267747", "Content": "I was in Paris to celebrate my 29th birthday and my sister and I stayed at the Hotel Gabriel Paris Marais and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

On the one hand Hotel Gabriel offers the best hotel bed I ever slept in, in a very clean room, in a hotel that was refurbished by an Australian (if I remember correctly) designer, and serving a very good breakfast (bio-organic) quality-wise. But still I feel a bit ripped off, paying 640 euros for three nights plus breakfast for two. Maybe the overpriced part is due to the money that was paid to the interior designer. So, although having slept like a rose, and having had a good breakfast, we also noticed some downside details: - Room: very small, sometimes there was a subtle 'sewer'-smell hanging around (getting better after putting a towel on the shower draining), there was no place to hang our towels, everything got wet when taking a shower (shower curtain, maybe?). - Breakfast: great quality, but not much diversity (only one type of cheese, no charcuterie), very small tables. - Service: our iPod-docking station didn't work. We had to ask several times before it was replaced. Conclusion: the quality of this hotel is good, but it also feels a bit pretentious (maybe because of the designer stuff?), and when paying almost 200 euros for a night, it doesn't entirely live up to it's expectations.

Its a bit hard to find if you dont know where you're going but once you've found it you've got it. When you have a shower (at least in my room) there's only a partition for half of it so there was always water on the floor I had to wipe up. So dont dance in the shower if you dont want to mop the floor. All in all I would subordinately go back! I love trip advisor!

Having said that, we filled up every morning on some delicious items (while in France, it's hard to go past the croissants!), and there was an endless supply of tea and warm, friendly service - a great start to the day! I would say that the location is almost perfect - close to Republique Metro (which has multiple lines), a stones throw from Canal Saint Marting (highly recommend La Verre Vole for lunch), and a great distance for walking down through Marais (great shops, cafes, just beautiful!) towards the River and all that is on offer along the banks of the Seine.

It's very discreet, event to the extent that we walked past it twice before realising where it was. It is a Detox hotel and our room, although small, was well furnished and very, very cosy. The bathroom was like a large cubicle in the room but it was also nicely done. We had a large flat screen TV embedded in the wall but either it, or more likely the remote control, was not working. Because the TV was behind a sheet of glass in the wall, we couldn't operate it manually. I reported the fault to the reception in the morning, but when we got back in the evening, found that they had done nothing about it at all. So, we had no TV for the two nights of our stay. Our complimentary water was also missing. I didn't even know we should have had one until I read it in the booklet on the second day. So we never got that! Breakfast was taken in the breakfast area on the ground floor. I knew it was a rather pricey \u00e2\u201a\u00ac17 each but thought we would try it. Oh dear! There were a few bread rolls, some cereals, cheese and some hard boiled eggs. No cold meats but that's usual in Paris. There was no orange or other juice on display - you had to ask for it as it was kept behind the counter and accessible only to the staff. Worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac17? No way! We didn't bother on the second day. Finally, at the checkout, the hotel presented me with a bill for two nights' accommodation. They didn't seem to realise that I had already paid in advance. Soon sorted but what was most galling was the amount they were asking for was considerably less than what I'd paid through Eurostar.

I had never been to Paris and didn't know the neighborhoods but I was so lucky. The Marais Area (spreads across parts of the 3rd and 4th arrondissements) is amazing. I didn't use mass transit once during my stay, I walked everywhere. It was December, cold and snowing most of the time but everything was still comfortably within walking distance. The furthest landmark from the hotel must have been Arc de Triomphe which I visited on my way to the Palais de Chaillot and then on to Tour Effiel. I saw every notable landmark in Paris on foot from Hotel Gabriel. At night after dinner it was a very short walk to the best nightlife in the city, Rue Oberkampf. My room was amazing, clean and modern. The hotel has a \"Detox\" theme that has as much to do with your mind as your body (and luckily nothing to do with alcohol, because I like to drink in the evenings). I really enjoy the peaceful feeling that this theme imposed on me by my choice. The hotel staff was more than friendly, they went out of there way to be accommodating. Any hour of the day or night a staff member was present and able to speak to me in English (I know I should work more on my French).Any question I had was meet with a thought out and helpful answer. I am very pleased with Hotel Gabriel and its staff. Only thing that I didn't like is that the complementary bottle of water was not replenished each morning, I only got one for my entire stay.

The staff was really helpful and even though the hotel is situated in a neighbourhood crowded with restaurants and nightlife, the rooms where calm and quite and the bed amazingly comfortable! I loved everything from the design details, the lit up walls, the bathroom, the wide assortment of Kusmin teas and the sleeping device that woke me up in the morning with music and soft light :-) Will most definitely come back!", "Date": "August 3, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Gabriel Paris Marais", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d529918-Reviews-Hotel_Gabriel_Paris_Marais-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$176 - $332*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">25 rue du Grand Prieure</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75011</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "529918", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/60/48/604872005cb487feae618326219ef9e06large.jpg"}}
