If you want air con, lifts and all the mod cons go to the big named hotels that will happily separate you from lots f your money for each night you stay. A lot of the hotels in London are like the Orchard Hotel - historic four or five story terrace houses that have been converted into a hotel. This is the best one of those we have stayed in so far. Stayed with my wife and two young children in a Quad room - one double and two standard single beds. The room was very large - the biggest in the hotel. TV had multiple channels - only thing missing is a channel listing and it would take for ever to surf thru the channels to find what the kiddies wanted. There is no air conditioning, or fans, so on a hot summers night it can be warm in the rooms - guess it depends on what you are used to as to whether that is a problem. There is breakfast, but never made it. Timing for this was strange - finished at 8:30am. But if you walk out the hotel, turn left and take the second road on the left - you will find plenty of little cafes that do a wonderful breakfast.

No frills, no shampoo, no tea and coffee, not even a shelf for your toothbrush. Bed was comfy and the bed linen clean, not always the case at this price range I believe. A good point on a sweltering night, the room faced the back, and the window opened fully. Sussex Gardens is a pleasant street, lined with small hotels.

I know some hotels indicate that if you'd like to reuse your towels you should hang them on the rack and if you'd like new ones you should put them bathroom floor. That hadn't been my intention, but reusing them was not a problem. The next morning I left the wet towels (day two) on the bathroom floor expecting to receive new ones.

While we were satisfied with the distance between the Park and the hotel, we realised that the area was less than desirable. Upon entering reception we were greated by a less than welcoming gentleman, who seemed to find our mere presence a cause for complaint. Our room was at the front of the hotel, on the third floor, overlooking a block of flats and the main road. Although this did not appear to be an issue at first, it became more so later on as the road became quite busy during the night. Our room was surprisingly small, featuring two twin beds, a tiny bathroom lacking any toiletries or a plug for the sink. We had a very small television, although this was plugged into the only socket in the room. When we unplugged it to use our electrical items, we noticed that the television plug was frayed, which appeared slighly dangerous. There was no remote provided, some of the buttons on the front of the television did not work and the picture was intolerable. Another cause for concern was that the door did not feature any form of deadlock, or even a chain. When another guest entered the room opposite ours, resulting in their standing next to our door (the corridor was very narrow and dark) the door almost came open. As two young female travellers, this made us nervous to say the least. The final issue regarding the room was the window. It was a wooden sash, which in itself appeared quite pretty. However, we noticed when in bed that there was a constant breeze and the road noise was rather loud. There was a 3 inch gap between the upper and lower panes which could not be closed and hence had to be endured. Whilst the breeze was welcome during the warm temperatures, in winter I'd imagine this would become irritating. The breakfast room was located in the basement (four flights of stairs down from our room). Whilst we found a free table quickly (as we went into the breakfast room at 7.30am) those arriving slighly later had to wait. The 'full english breakfast' was beans, a rasher of bacon and a very 'well done' fried egg. On a positive note, we were given tea and coffee, toast, jam and butter to accompany the cooked breakfast and orange juice was available. All in all, I was a little shocked by the standard of the hotel and the fact that quite a few of the staff appeared to detest the inconvience of having guests, whilst they struggled to communicate with us due to poor English language abilities. That said, it was clean, the beds were quite comfortable and in relation to Hyde Park the location was okay.
