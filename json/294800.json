They are affordable and usually clean and they have a loyalty program through the Wyndham chain that encourages return stays. This trip we pre-booked most of our motels through the Wyndham website and were very pleased with the one that we stayed at in Las Vegas. It was a newly renovated property and new member of the Super 8 chain. It was freshly painted and very obviously clean. The rooms were a cut above the usual budget motel with their headboard and new linens. Even the way the beds were made up, looked more like a luxury hotel rather than just a budget. And the price was the lowest of the Wyndham chains. We changed our plans on our trip and came back to Las Vegas early and had to find a motel again for our last night. We returned to the same location and they extended the same 20% off when paid in advance price that we had booked on-line. Comments: Pros \u2022 Fresh and clean property \u2022 Staff that we dealt with were personable and good at their jobs \u2022 Very well priced \u2022 A certain higher level from the staff and property Cons \u2022 No fridge or coffee maker in the room Definitely a budget property that I can recommend and not, \u201cwould return to,\u201d we actually did return to it\u2026\u2026. and the price is the best of the other Wyndham properties. It is really, as the saying is, \u201ca no brainer\u201d Just a note to comment on our stay in the Super 8 in Las Vegas. It is newly renovated and new member of the Wyndham chain and we booked it off the Wyndham website sight unseen, of course. It was hard to find because they are apparently waiting approval for their new sign but what a surprise being there. It is obviously being managed by someone with a higher than average \u2026..something\u2026. perhaps professionalism. The property is clean because it is new but the rooms/beds were made up a cut above what we expected and have experienced in other Super 8 properties. The staff were professional and personable and they made it a good experience which sometimes can be lacking especially in a budget motel.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201csuper 8 super vacation\u201d", "Author": "leon s", "ReviewID": "UR124979616", "Content": "me and my family stayed in for 3 nigth and 4 days the hotel crew was really cool and profesional help me with all my family needs and always were available to us truly nice place and will defenetly will be back thanks guys Leon .s miami", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cSuper 8, Super Place\u201d", "Author": "Gila L", "ReviewID": "UR123816838", "Content": "In the last minute I found this new Super 8 on Las Vegas Blvd, Great place to stay for the $$$ Very Clean in just minute from the strip.

The single queen size bedroom only provides basic needs, no microwave, kettle, coffee maker nor fridge. Hence, it's not convenient if you want to make a hot drink.

You can definatley tell they were up grading everything slowly but surely. After one night with a few of my friends it was okay, but then they left me in vegas by my self. the next day i met one of the hotel owners. He realized i was in a jam. He made me feel at home and helped me out as much as he can. i met a few other people that worked at the hotel like a cleaning lady and one of the clerks. they were really nice. My point is i felt at home. yeah the area is not the best and the hotel is not at its highest peak but i will deffinatley stay there every time i go to vegas for now on. its right next to a wedding chappel so they try and keep the weidos away cuz they they want there guests to feel at home. I deffinatley reccomend this hotel mostly cuz its a great price and great people. Why would you spend all this money on a hotel in vegas when you go to vegas to get drunk and have fun.NOT TO STAY IN YOUR HOTEL!!! i was barely in my room,cuz i was out haveing fun.when i was in there i was sleeping, the beds are great. i love that all rooms are non smoking, but most of the rooms have huge balconys. its very close to the stratosphere and its on las vegas blvd. on the strip. i hope you take my word for it.

No bed skirt etc. you can see that in my pics also the water pressure and the hot/cold seemed to be off. I had a 3rd floor room. I didn't notice any issue with noise. Continental breakfast is nothing special at all. Just basic enough for them to sell it as a feature.

Pros: the check-in agent gave us a room at the more quiet end of the building after requested. The bathroom was quite ok. Cons: The building is old and worn-out.

We checked out Tripadvisor, our trusted source, and found the Continental Suites, at the time sitting at #9 for all hotels in Las Vegas. At $29 per night for 2 nights, and $49 per night for the other two, we figured we would take a chance. We've been to Las Vegas a half dozen times before, and never went the \"cheapest hotel we could find\" route, so we thought we'd experiment. Pros: We had booked a balcony room, and ours overlooked the chapel next door, so it was entertaining to watch the weddings, especially on Halloween. We also asked for and got a fridge for our entire stay, so that was good. Parking was never a problem, it was available on both sides of the building. Free internet was a bonus in this town that is notorious for charging for it all along the strip. Cons: Overall the hotel is a bit run down with stained carpets in the hallway and a non-functioning ice machine (not that I was going to get any anyway). The towels are hit and miss, the tv only has about a dozen channels, and the bed is not at all comfortable. I realized after this trip that I really do need a few more comforts when I travel, and a nice bed is at the top of my list. We also skipped the breakfast. I personally would not choose to stay here again, but I can't completely bash the place at $29 and $49 per night.

Well, we were first attracted to this hotel because of the price and the fact that it was rated #9 out of almost 300 hotels in Las Vegas.

After reading the reviews and then staying there, I'm thinking that they're either dilusional or they're talking about a different hotel. The prices on tripadvisor were accurate but there is NO WAY this hotel should be rated #9. It was so gross. The towels and washcloths had multiple long black hairs in them. We asked for an extra pillow and they brought us a dirty/smelly one. The bathroom smelled like a port-a-potty. The carpet looked pretty clean but after I took a shower and walked to my bed, my feet were dirty again. When the people in the room above us came back for the night, they were walking around and talking to each other. The floors creaked with every step they took and we heard every word they said. They weren't being ridiculously loud, the floors were just that thin. It kept me awake for a couple hours. The parking lot was TINY - both the number of parking spots as well as the spots themselves - they were so close together that we could hardly get out of our car without scratching the ones on either side of us. Adjacent to the parking lot was a vacant lot full of garbage dumps that were overflowing with trash. We went to get some ice from the ice machine and there was a homeless guy living in one of the stairwells. There were prostitutes and drug dealers on the street right outside.

Few frills but great value. The hotel is basic but clean. Our room looked like they had recently removed one of two beds, but left everything else in place making for an awkward arrangement. The bathroom had nice tile floor and marble counters, making it a little fancier than I was expecting. It didn't quite go with the rest of the hotel, which was so basic that their complimentary shampoo + conditioner came in foil packets like ketchup. One nice add-on: free wifi. Few hotels in the area offer free wifi, charging anywhere from $9.99 to $13.99, so this was a good perk. Nothing fancy, but it wasn't bad either. If you just need a place to sleep and shower this will suit your needs just fine at a great price. Tip: This hotel apparently just reopened under the name Continental Suites, so there's not much signage. Make sure not to blink or you'll miss it - look for the giant neon \"Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel\" sign and make that turn. They share a parking lot.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Hotel, a gem in the desert\u201d", "Author": "Esther B", "ReviewID": "UR118135099", "Content": "My family and I spent a weekend at The Continental Suites in Las Vegas.
