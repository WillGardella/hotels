We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as there are loads of lovely cafes with a few metres. The Moulin Rouge is a wonderful experience but I would also recommend the restaurant Le Basilic, great food at a great price and just a few minutes walk away.

We were a party of 10 and had booked 6 rooms. We were in Paris to celebrate my partners 40th birthday and prior to visiting, after contacting the hotel to see if they could arrange something special for my partner, we had our comfort room upgraded to the superior room. This room was excellent, very quiet and very well decorated. The rest of our party had booked comfort and standard rooms and all though they varied in size, again they were all very clean and well decorated. The hotel was well situated for the Moulin Rouge which took us only a couple of minutes to walk to for us to see the fantastic show. The nearby restaurants and bars and the walk to Sacre Coeur were not far at all. Finally, the service in the hotel was exceptional, especially Vincent, to whom nothing was too much trouble. If you want a small tradtional boutique hotel, Le Relais Montmarte is wonderful.

Around the corner there are more than 10 breakfast places where you can get a breakfast for half the price but probably not so extensive. Restaurants, cafe's shops were all in minutes walking distance. The hotel is located approximately between Pigalle (with the moulin rouge) and Sacre Coeur Cathedral. The hotel staff was very helpful in explaining were to go and how to get there all in good english. At night we went to restaurants and of course we had to see the show in the Moulin rouge, champagne included. From former vacations with a girl friend I learned NEVER take your girl to a to a cheap hotel, no matter how romantic the city is, sleeping with the flees in a bad bed on a dirty noisy room makes for months of quarreling instead of positive memories of great stay.

After spending about 15 nights in hotels across Italy and having such a tough time booking a hotel in Paris, out of desperation I booked this hotel on Hotels.com since every other \"recommended hotel by Rick Steves\" was full. I was trying to find a hotels in the locations recommended by him and I am glad I was unsuccessful in finding a hotel in those areas since I would have never found this gem of a hotel or such a vibrant neighborhood of Montmartre. We arrived after midnight from Milan from the Gare De Lyon Train station by Taxi which was about 16 Euros at that time of night, and the person greeting us was very welcoming and gave us the keys and also the WI-FI userids and passwords for the two laptops we had. He even gave us a Ethernet cable since you could also use an Ethernet connection in the rooms. He even gave me an adapter since I could not find mine to fit the European style plugs. The room was very well appointed with a very comfortable bed and lots of electric outlets (which is useful if you have multiple things to charge). The bathroom was very nice with a very nice bathtub, separate area for the toilet and very nice toiletries. Plenty of hot water and good water pressure. The room air conditioning was excellent though we didn't use it much since it was on the cooler side in Paris. Though we were facing Rue Constance we hardly heard any noises during the night and hence had great uninterrupted sleep. Breakfast was not included in our room rate and we did not eat breakfast at the hotel, there are plenty of places within a block to eat as well. This is in the heart of Montmartre area, and about a few blocks to Moulan Rouge and the Blanche Metro Stop. Its also pretty close to Sacre-Couer. Though we had booked for 3 nights on hotels.com it appeared that the room was not available for the 3rd night due to a mix up and the hotel was arranging for us to stay at another place the 3rd night, fortunately they were able to accommodate us in the same room which was a relief. The staff spoke excellent English and were always available and friendly. It also surprised us that everyone we encountered in Paris spoke English to us while we attempted to speak our pathetic little French.

The location of the rooms was exactly as requested with a ground floor room for mother, and an upper floor for us. Rooms were fairly spacious and well decorated.

We chose Montmartre as it is a little bit away from the main city and tourist attractions but near Sacre Coeur. We arrived in the late afternoon feeling quite tired, so when we got off the Metro at Blanche in Boulevard de Clichy, right in the heart of the red light district, we wondered if we had made the right decision. However we walked along Rue Leipc and up the little side street where the Relais Montmartre is situated and felt a little better as once round the corner, it is a completely different world. When we got inside the hotel we realised it was a little gem. There is a beautifully decorated front lobby/lounge area and a small courtyard with seating outside. Our two rooms were quite small but perfectly formed with lovely fresh and tasteful decor, comfortable beds and superb shower rooms that had shaver points and hairdryers. We had chosen the 'cheapest' rooms in the hotel but got a peek at one of the larger rooms which looked quite a lot more spacious and equally as nice as ours. The only gripe perhaps was the price but then you pay for what you get. The staff we very friendly and accommodating, spoke good English and helped us sort out the right bus into the centre of the city. Going on the bus is a much better option than the metro. It's more pleasant generally and you get to see some sights along the way. Rue des Abbesses, just up the road from the hotel has countless bars, interesting shops and restaurants. We had a lot of fun walking up and down, browsing in the shops and stopping for coffee or a beer etc. It's far enough away from the Sacre Coeur area so you don't feel too crowded out by other tourists (go to Place du Tertre to have a look but don't stay too long). Everywhere we went we got a friendly welcome and we enjoyed a very nice lunch at 'A La Pomponette' in Rue Lepic. If you don't want to got too far afield to experience a French style Brasserie, try Brasserie Wepler, a five minute walk away on the very busy Place de Clichy, especially if you love seafood.", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucks", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "HMLBucks", "ReviewID": "UR38326559", "Content": "What a lovely, charming hotel in a great area.

Lovely decoration, a bit English B and B style, the room was whisper quiet, it did face the inner courtyard rather than the street, but as the courtyard is big there was plenty of light in the room. The bathroom was a good size and there was a separate toilet (well at least the toilet was still in the main bathroom but there was a door) which was nice. The location is terrific, 5 mins from Blanche metro and just off rue Lepic which has loads of cafes and shops.

Once we got to know the area we really did like the villiage atmosphere with the local Boulangerie, creperies and cafes. No complaints in relation to being in Montmartre as the area is quaint. Convenient to Metro Blanche and not too expensive by taxi at least to the Moulin Rouge then a quick walk up the hill. On first impression the lobby was very cute although my partner noted a smell of a hair salon perm treatment. I noticed it too and said it must just be some recent cleaning they have done although that smell greeted us everytime we were in any of the public areas in the hotel during our entire stay. Fortunately the smell didn't filter into the room if you laid a towel at the door. Noone could explain where the smell was coming from either which didn't help matters. The internet in the hotel lobby was not working either which was a little inconvenient as I do like to check email and update friends and family for a couple of minutes every few days whilst I am away. Some of the day staff offered the front desk computer although I never wished to imposs on them while they were trying to do thier job. The day staff all were pleasant, professional and amused me in my attempt to speak French to the best of my abilities. Most of our conversations where in English however. The room, on the first floor, was small but well laid out. I like the fact that we had two windows, one in the washroom that looked out onto a courtyard and one in the bedroom looking out onto the mainstreet with a view of other similiar buildings on Rue du Constance. We also had the hotel sign outside our window which fortunately wasn't lite at night. The bathroom was spacious with a good toilet and sink area. The bath/shower was elevated off the ground by about 6 inches which made it slippery and not easily accessible to get in and out of, especially as the floor was usually covered in water because the glass partition in the shower was not large enough to prevent the splashing from happening. The bathroom toiletries where pathtic and not to the standard of a room that cost 175 Euros per night. The night staff at the hotel, particularly the one young fellow who was on three of four nights (Oct 1, 2, 3) was absolutely unprofessional and left alot to be desired. He was downright rude and did his best to ignore us. On evening we came back to the hotel late and the hotel door was locked and noone was at the desk to answer the door. This is acceptable as I am sure he was in the washroom or doing otherwork elsewhere in the hotel. We waited less than a few minutes at the door and when he walked by he just turned the lock open on the door and walked to his computer and sat down without opeing the door for us or apologizing for the slight inconvenience of having to wait outside while he was doign his other work. This just left a bad taste in my mouth, let alone the perm smell was still everywhere in the hotel at the time. The day prior to departing I asked the front desk clerk to book us a taxi to Charles Du Gaulle Airport for our flight home the next day. He told me the taxi would cost between 50 - 60 Euros and it would be much cheaper and just as convenient for us to book a shuttle with the hotel. He said it would cost a 12 Euro booking fee to the hotel and then 26 Euro to the driver. We told him to make those arrangements and he said he would and then would leave a confirmation to be picked up at the desk when we come back to the hotel later in the night. Fortunately a new night clerk was on who was very pleasant and gave us the reciept and we paid him the 12 Euros booking fee. He explained our shuttle would be at 1030am instead of 1100am. The reservation stated we would pay the driver 28 Euros. This was 2 Euros more than what the front desk told us earlier in the day. No explanation could be given. Oh well, no worries! The next morning my partner and I came down at 1015am to check out of the hotel but low and behold the driver was already there. My partner and I put our bags down and paid the driver the 28 Euros as stated on our reservation. He picked up my partners bag and took it to the shuttle as I went and settled the bill for the room at the front desk. I saw the driver come into the hotel lobby three times and go back out to the car, assuming he took my luggage. The driver had parked the shuttle in the street and there were a few cars honking behind him so he spoke with the desk clerk and myself and said to hurry along and get into the shuttle. We end up leaving the hotel in a rush and on arrival at the airport I notice that the driver never took my bag from the hotel lobby. This clearly is partially my responsibility as I never double checked to see if my bag was in the shuttle or not but the driver also never picked my bags and hurried me along to get into the shuttle. The driver let me us his mobile and I called the hotel where they confirmed my bag was still in the lobby. The driver said he could call the head office to see if another shuttle could pick the luggage up and drop us off at the airport. This was too confusing though as we were pressed for time and I didn't want anymore confusion to occur. My partner and I had to take a taxi back to the hotel to retrieve the bag and then toke the taxi back to the hotel. This mistake cost as almost 80 Euro. The reason I am writing this parishuttle complaint under this hotel review, is that the taxi to the airport from the hotel would have cost under the 40 Euros we spent on the shuttle. The taxi cost 37 Euros from the Airport to the hotel. When I arrived at the hotel to pick my bag up I complained to the front desk clerk who originally told me a taxi to the airport would cost 50 -60 Euros. I told him that the taxi just cost us 37 Euro, cheaper than the shuttle and way cheaper than what he told us it would cost to go by taxi.

Our room was small and the bathroom with shower was tiny, but I had chosen the least expensive option. Nevertheless everything was clean, which is my first priority, and there was a nice assortment of personal toiletries as well. Evidently all the rooms are color coordinated and lavender dominated the color scheme in ours. The windows looked out onto a delightful little courtyard which was furnished with patio tables and chairs. The price of 147 euros did not include breakfast, which we could have purchased for 13 euros for a buffet breakfast, but my husband and I chose to walk to a local cafe for coffee and croissant. After two weeks in France we were worrying about how much weight we were gaining! I booked this hotel primarily for its location, two blocks away from the Moulin Rouge. This was our last night in France and I wanted to stay in an area close to the airport, but not at a hotel airport. Since we had not seen the Montmartre area I thought this was a perfect location. Little did I know that on the major boulevard on which the Moulin Rouge is located, there are sex shops of all sorts lining both sides. Sitting in the taxi as it wend its way through the streets, I wondered if I had made a mistake in booking the hotel, as the area seemed seedy, populated by questionable characters. But as it turned into Rue Constance I realized that as in many cities, nice neighborhoods are located right next to not-so-nice neighborhoods. The buildings adjoining the hotel were obviously well maintained and the streets were clean. As for the Moulin Rouge, we didn't bother going. The prices are outrageous. Back to Le Relais de Montmartre, this hotel was a great value, but if we had wanted to see all the sights of Paris, such as Arc de Triomphe, Tour Eiffel, Louvre, etc, we would have spent a lot of time and money taking the Metro or taxis from this part of town. Instead we stayed at a hotel on the Rive Gauche (see my review of the Hotel Millesime) on the first part of our trip and walked to all those destinations. I also believe the restaurants are better on the Rive Gauche. In the brochure for the hotel I noticed there is a website that has pictures of the rooms: http://www.relaismontmartre.fr/", "Date": "August 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Le Relais Montmartre\u201d", "Author": "cantik1962", "ReviewID": "UR18757357", "Content": "This was a great little hotel with great location.

To compete in the city of style, any Parisian hotel worth its salt has to provide an impeccable experience, especially when they are so traditionally short on room space \u2013 which you can always overcome by spending many hundreds of Euros per night. For me though, like many modern travelers today fed up with the cold inhumanity of many expensive brand name establishments, I\u2019m now happiest when I can stay in a personalized boutique property at a reasonable rate and especially when I discover a tucked-away, well-priced and wonderfully convenient gem such as this. Personal friendly service from the Manager/Concierge and an intimate country style feel in the furnishings and d\u00e9cor instantly make you feel at home. Where is it? In a quiet, almost village-like setting yet in the middle of downtown Montmartre on the Rue de la Constance, it\u2019s just two or three minutes walk from the Moulin Rouge and the nearby Metro station this hotel is ideally situated for all of the delights of Paris, and most immediately La Butte Montmartre with its touristy artists, restaurants and bars and of course the famous Sacr\u00e9 Coeur, and its unbeatable Parisian evening skyline view. Rooms and Facilities Le Relais Montmartre is a 26 roomed property. The rooms are spread over several floors, and served by a small but quiet elevator. They come in three varieties and are all reasonable in size; the \u2018standard\u2019 rooms come with a full shower in the bathroom, \u2018comfort\u2019 rooms have a full bathroom and \u2018superior\u2019 have both a full bathroom and separate toilet. On the downside my wife felt the bathroom hairdryer was small and not very useful but the sheets, duvets and towels were thick and fluffy. Wooden beams across the rooflines, pieces of period antique furniture and delicate fabrics enhance the atmosphere of the rooms, although the beds, mini-bars, digital clock, room safe and flat screen TV\u2019s are very modern. Free internet connectivity is an added touch, which simply requires a code to be entered into your laptop and is given by the manager on duty. The rooms either face the street (a quiet lane) or the interior courtyard and both are pleasant. Turn left out of the front door and twenty paces brings you to the heart of the Montmartre district. Restaurants, caf\u00e9s and bistros abound; this is Paris at her best. We shopped for local camembert, bread rolls and bottled water and snacked on the best tasting supper ever to be eaten on a park bench! Vive la France! A continental breakfast is served in either your room or in one of two vaulted breakfast rooms, if desired and requested on check-in and there are drinks served in the summer on the small interior patio, with tea and coffee available in the downstairs lounge with its warming fireplace in the winter. Leisure Activities The local Metro station is one minute away and the open-top Parisian tour busses stop directly opposite its entrance. Sacr\u00e9 Coeur atop La Butte is a ten to fifteen minute gentle stroll uphill whilst the world famous Moulin Rouge is a two minute downhill walk. To describe this property as centrally situated in a fabulous tourist area simply wouldn\u2019t do it justice; it really is in the perfect setting. Verdict? It\u2019s outstanding and great value. We had booked a standard room at \u20ac155 which will comfortably accommodate two people although we were upgraded to a \u2018comfort room\u2019 at no extra charge on our first visit and without asking for it. (Normal cost \u20ac175). A superior room goes for \u20ac195. Breakfast is an additional \u20ac13 per person. We returned to the hotel for an additional night after a brief business trip to Hungary and were welcomed back as if we were long-lost friends; this time staying in a standard room facing the street which offered a fabulous local Parisian view \u2013 and was very quiet indeed.

The Hotel Le Relais Montmartre is wonderful. I have read all the previous reviews and I didn't think that the hotel could live up to its billing. Well it did. The hotel is quaint (but not in a chintzy way), immaculately clean and superbly located. The staff are all extremely courteous and professional and are very willing to help in any way possible. The hotel is situated just a couple of minutes away from Rue le Pic and Rue des Abbesses, where there are dozens of cafes, bistros and wonderful shops. I particularly admire the way that the shops seem to take a great pride in displaying their goods, be it designer clothes, jewellery or basics such as bread or fruit. The bustle of Montmartre is only a stones throw away, yet the hotel is situated on a very quiet street and the Blanche Metro stop is only a leisurely 5 minutes walk away. Worth bearing in mind however is that if you get off the Metro at Abbesses, you should be prepared to walk up dozens of steps to ground level if you don't want to use the elevator. I would recommend going up to the Sacre Coeur at night, just to see a view of Paris at night. The Eiffel tower is constantly lit up during the hours of darkness, but on the hour, it twinkles for about 10 minutes. Paris is definately more expensive than other parts of France and it might be a good idea not to let it bother you too much if you want to make the most of your time there.

But the attention to detail was all there: gorgeous unfinished ceiling rafters; immaculate, top-of-the-line bathroom. Another room, a deluxe, (which I took, as it was given at the standard rate) was on the top floor in the back, away from the street. Quieter than a bank vault, its many windows overlook a courtyard. It is a good room in which to watch fascinating French public access and news programs until three in the morning while steadily demolishing mini-bar's cognac supply. Everything about this hotel was perfect. It comes highly recommended.", "Date": "February 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely fantastic!\u201d", "Author": "Andytheknife", "ReviewID": "UR13086944", "Content": "It was our first time visiting Paris and we couldn't have picked a more friendly and inviting hotel to explore the city from. The reception staff were very accomodating and were always on hand if you needed them. They also spoke very good English which is a bonus if you are a French language novice like i am! The hotel was impeccable clean throughout our stay. We had the breakfast on our day of departure which was also very good. The surrounding area of Montmartre is very picturesque and if you like venturing off the beaten track, there are many great places to eat and drink. We tried to avoid the obvious tourist traps but were stung once resulting in a fairly awful meal at The Crepery place in the centre of Montmartre! All in all, a great first stay in a marvellous hotel. We will definately be back to explore more of Paris and i wouldn't think of staying anywhere else but here!", "Date": "January 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "joannac", "Title": "\u201cVery helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "joannac", "ReviewID": "UR13014103", "Content": "The hotel was lovely, very clean, the rooms are decorated in quite a kitcsh style, which is cute.

The owners have found the perfect balance of running the hotel in a highly professional yet friendly, helpful and intimate manner. There is great attention to detail and everything is spotlessly clean. The beautiful decor with top quality furnishings is a welcome change from most other boutique hotels today which end up feeling rather cold and charmless.
