{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Tolerable Stayed here overnight while waiting to board a flight at Sydney Airport. Courtesy shuttle is very convenient, came promptly at the scheduled time from the airport. Bus driver provided a totally smiless service, and that pretty much summed up the service of the hotel. Upon entering hotel, the feeling was of a time warp back to the 80's. Hotel decor really needs some updating and has little style. The rooms were of an okay size, and we actually had a nice view of Sydney in the far distance. We used the gym facilities which were bare essential systems 10m on the outside of the hotel. We had trouble entering the gym, which was actually locked....but when we came back to reception, they just told us to swipe our card....which was not possible as that part of the hotel was actually locked by another member of the staff..... so we had to come back, and apparently another staff member locks the gate every shift but the others were not aware. The restaurant had surprisingly tasty food, although the environment was poor and banging in the kitchen could be hear loudly. Staff were friendly, but not well trained. This made the food overpriced. So overall it was a functional and convenient stay, but hardly a memorable experience, like using an old laptop with Windows 95 to type up an essay.", "Date": "Dec 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR560000441", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "agent_bx"}, {"Content": "Not really impressed After an unimpressive experience at Holiday Inn Sydney Airport (the first room given smelled very strongly of urine, and the replacement room smelled musty and damp), I decided to try Mercure Hotel Sydney Airport. It appears that I have so far had no luck with finding a good Sydney Airport hotel (I was not particularly happy with Stamford Plaza either).One of the reception staff when I was checking in was not exactly terrific - not so much rude but told me that I had to have a printout of the confirmation email for my booking when there was no such requirement mentioned anywhere. It took a while to sort this out, but it was eventually agreed that I did not need to print it out and he begrudgingly allowed me to check into the room (for which I had already paid). It wasn't a very good start to the stay!The room was quite spacious, although quite dated. It smelled a little damp but nothing serious (I find that many Australian hotels smell damp for some reason). Bathroom cleanliness left a bit to be desired, and it also looked dated. Generally, the room was basic but adequate, although they could, and should, do better for the price they charge.The bar had a rather poor atmosphere (quite rough) and the service was very, very, very slow. It wasn't the fault of the staff - they appeared to be very short staffed, but from the customer's point of view it was quite unsatisfactory.Upon check-out, I noticed an error in the bill (someone else's food consumption was put on my room account) but the staff member (different one from the one that dealt with my check-in) dealt with it smoothly and without fuss, so that made up for the poor check-in experience.Hotel's transport to the airport worked very well - it was efficient and effective, so that's a good point.Overall, I was not very impressed with Mercure Sydney Airport. I'd stay there again if I need to, but I would much rather stay somewhere else - the only problem is that I have so far not found a decent alternative.", "Date": "Dec 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR801518952", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "EuroFrequentFlyer"}, {"Content": "Good Standard Stop Over Hotel Firstly, I've read other reviews on this property and had to ask myself what do I expect from a hotel directly relating to the purpose of my visit .I see Mercure Hotel Sydney Airport as an overnight stop over before or after travel and have used it on three occassions now with very little complaint.These reviews are to rate a hotel as you see it and not to try antanticipate what others standards are and what they may want from the place. I appreciate that peoples standards vary with experience and needs etc. Please read my review based on this.To us the Mercure Hotel was clean, comfortable and reasonable value with a park and fly deal for seven days booked directly through the property.Yes, the restaurant is a little expensive but they don't try to hide their prices which are clearly displayed at the entrance. We didn't have breakfast there so won't comment. The bar was disappointing. The barman on the night we stayed appeared uninterested and unfriendly and the drink prices were excessive. Fortunately, little of our travel time is spent hanging around hotel bars. There is a perfectly good club venue with meal and bar facilities within a short walking distance of the hotel. The front desk staff were found to be courteous and efficient. No more could be asked and no more was looked for.The twin standard room we booked was clean and comfortable. Fittings were a little tired or well used but again quite adequate for a short stop over. Beds were comfortable and linen conducive to a good nights sleep. Towels and toiletries etc were also fine. No complaints for the money paid. We were not spending a lot of time in this room so have to be fair in judgement. Mini bar is from a machine in the hallway and charged to your room card which is one way of short cutting those that take delight in abusing the usual system.A wake up call booked for 0430 was on time and the shuttle service to the International terminal was efficient and also on time. (No problem with the return shuttle service either). We have stayed here before and also at Holiday Inn Sydney Airport and would rate both similarly. The only disadvantage of the Mercure is that long stay parking is in the open whilst that provided by Holiday inn is usually undercover. In general, few complaints compared to others. If you are not overly critical and discerning and fairly laid back in your approach to a simple airport stop over hotel than Mercure will do you just fine.", "Date": "Dec 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR136583049", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Austin-Powers63"}, {"Content": "Not bad, but let down by noisy aircon in room Stayed here two nights prior to return flights back to England.This hotel is was not too bad. The room was large enough and clean enough. However, we had booked a King Bed and only got a Queen bed.The worst thing about the room was the noise of the air-conditioning unit - we didn't have ours turned on, but it kept clonking all the same. I complained the next morning just prior to going out for the day. Reception promised that it would be looked at. No surprise really when we got back to the room rather lat that night to find nothing done and the noise persisted. It was the most disturbed sleep I had during a three week stay in Australia. I don\u9225\u6a9b think customer satisfaction is top priority, probably because they know most stays are short term.The bar prices were average for hotel bars for Australia - about S$6 for a beer and A$3 for soft drink. The bar staff were friendly enough. Restaurant prices more expensive and I did not use the restaurant because of this, so cannot comment on the quality. The reception lobby is clean and pleasant enough.Booked online with popular web booking agent (who I used for other online bookings on the same holiday without problem, so know it was the hotel and not the online booking agent). However, on check-in the reception presented us with a balance due when it had already been paid. Luckily I had a copy of the online confirmation of payment/booking. The hotel made a photocopy of this and there were no further problems. However, it is still disconcerting when presented with a balance due (other hotels I stayed in on this same holiday, knew it had been paid up front on check-in). So holidaymakers beware, take a copy of your confirmation booking/payment with you.There is a shuttle bus from/to the airport, but it is not free and will cost A$5 per person per way. But this is convenient for getting to the hotel from the airport. The hotel is close by the airport.There is not a lot around the hotel, so do not expect bars or restaurants nearby. In the day you can walk along the Cook River as there is a small park facing the hotel. There is a free gym and free outdoor swimming pool at the hotel. Squash  Tennis courts could be hired if you are the sporty type \u9225?no sauna or Jacuzzi though.The cheapest way to get around from the hotel is by local train - a 15 minute walk to Wolli Creek station and it costs A$4.60 for a day ticket (trains run well past midnight). This is only one way to and then from Sydney city centre (any station ie. Central or Town Hall etc), but you can\u9225\u6a9b hop on hop off trains all day. But both Central  Town Hall are centrally located in Sydney. If you don\u9225\u6a9b mind catching the train then it is not hard to get to and from the city centre.If it wasn\u9225\u6a9b for the noisy air conditioning within then hotel, this would have been quite a decent hotel.P, England", "Date": "Nov 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR505188315", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "PLL-England"}, {"Content": "Poor Service, Dirty Room Arrived back at the hotel after flight late evening with 2 small children only to find that the staff had yet again forgotten to put a cot in our room.

I could hear the guy in the room next to me speaking to his girlfriend on the phone. I could even hear HER telling him how much she loved him.The Hotel is located out near the international terminal. There is nothing around in terms of shops and restaurants so you are limited to eating in-house. I suffer from food allergies from heavily processed foods \u9225?I was sick each time I ate in the hotel, it\u9225\u6a9a obvious the food they are producing is coming from packets. Feeling ill from bad food, one night I just wanted some simple soup from room service and what I got was so obviously a packet of French onion soup that they didn\u9225\u6a9b even add any cheese or garnish to in order to disguise it. It was revolting.Dinner in the restaurant was a bit of a debacle on the first night. Note \u9225?if you plan to eat there you need a reservation unless you come very early. I witnessed very tired guests who had travelled internationally being turned away as there was no room for them to have dinner. It is also VERY expensive. You have the option paying for 2 or 3 courses.

One should never compare, anyway, but, secretly, one does nevertheless...Well, the first impression began at the airport, where we waited for 40 minutes in the (already pretty burning) sun, for the hotel shuttle bus to come. We guess, we just missed the one for our hotel, as we saw one bus after the other passing by, for the other 4 hotels, until at last, ours came, too. We considered ourselves lucky that we had brought an umbrella with us, which gave us some shade...and that it was not pouring with rain, because there is no shelter at all for bus stop number 6, which is the one for the 5 airport hotels.Next time we will probably take a taxi, as waiting 40 minutes for a 10 minutes ride, seems a bit exaggerated in our eyes, but all depends on the weather and your patience, of course.The reception staff at the hotel was quite pleasant, the bed- and bathroom clean and functional.We had dinner at the only restaurant, the other being a bar offering snacks. The air conditioning worked well, which means that we regretted not having put a pullover on. We had the choice of a 2 or 3 course menu for either 55 or 65 AUD per person and could chose between half a dozen dishes each time. The appearance of the dishes was elaborated and they were more attractive for the eyes than for the palate. Service was rather slow and we were happy to get out of the cold restaurant at the end.

I went to my room and after using the toilet, found that it kept running very loudly after being flushed. I called the reception and they said they would send somebody up to look at it. Half an hour later, the toilet was still running, and I wanted just to sleep as my conference was early the following morning.

Because of the insane prices of Sydney hotels on New Year's, the price we paid for the hotel was reasonable, but only by comparison. Cheaper than downtown was about the best we could say about our rate.Overall, the hotel was a comfortable and passable site for a quick stay. If you're only visiting Sydney briefly, or need accessibility to the airport or long-distance rail, the Mercure may be a good choice.LOCATION: Literally seconds from Sydney International, the hotel is within view of the airport's International Arrivals area. The hotel has a shuttle available on a fixed schedule, but a cab ride is only $5 and may be more efficient. The hotel is located adjacent to a medium-sized park which is a pleasant place to get some fresh air on nice days, with biking/jogging trails around a small lagoon, and public playground equipment and barbeque grills available. About a 10 minute walk from the hotel is the Wolli Creek train station, with direct service to downtown and other popular areas like Bondi Junction. Trains to/from Wolli Creek are less than half the cost of trains directly to the airport, despite being on the same line and less than a mile away!ROOMS: The rooms are a bit dated, but were generally clean and acceptable. The bed was a bit firm for our tastes, but the room was spacious and had all of the amenities one would expect from a budget travel hotel. Initially, on check-in, we thought our air conditioning was broken -- however it was actually fine; the AC is controlled by a small not-obvious switch on the nightstand that must be turned on before the on-wall thermostat will work. There is no wireless Internet in the rooms.SERVICE: The front desk staff seemed somewhat overworked, and anything we needed involved a wait for either other guests, or people calling on the phone. They accommodated all of our requests, and were fairly knowledgeable about the Sydney area, but were a bit inefficient. We reserved a cab one evening, for the next morning -- and while they did call the next morning after the cab never arrived, other guests who were also waiting indicated that they'd also had problems reserving cabs through the front desk. Recommend booking your own.AMENITIES: The hotel's nod to snacks is a strange card-based minibar located outside the elevator on each floor. If you want to purchase standard minibar fare or alcohol, you get a card from the front desk that's linked to your room account. Your card unlocks the mini-bar, and removing any item from its slot charges it to your account. The hotel has no guest laundry, but there is a travel inn across the street that does have washers and dryers available. The front desk said they were available for our use, and that hotel had no problems with us using their facilities.There are undoubtedly better places to stay in Sydney, but if you need accessibility to the airport and want easy train access to downtown, this is a good traveler hotel for you.", "Date": "Feb 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR896984888", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Darlox"}, {"Content": "Very clean Stayed one night on the 5th December.

The gym was no better - very shabby and ill equiped. The room was 'ok', but close to needing refurbishment - we've stayed in better '4 star' rooms - but the bathroom very much needed upgrading. The bath was small and the door draughty, and the sink unit lacked even a basic shaving light!The evening buffet, too, was not up to '4 star' standard - nothing special.Overall, a disappointing experience.", "Date": "Nov 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR956631175", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "mylocath"}, {"Content": "Not too bad Stayed overnight while in town on business.

What a lousy welcome home to Australia after a few weeks enjoying the great service and amenities of Asian 4+ star hotels. In fact, I'm embarrassed that international visitors to Australia get some of their first impressions from this hotel.My wife and I arrived mid-evening after a pleasant Qantas flight from Hong Kong. We used the complimentary Mercure airport shuttle bus service which was easy to find and on-time. That was the one and only high point of our overnight stay.There is no porterage at the Mercure International Airport Hotel that we could find! Absolutely unacceptable, given that most international travellers have quite a bit of luggage. Our's was just unloaded out the front of the hotel and we lugged it inside where we queued to check-in. There was just one person on duty even though it was only 9:00pm. Again, not good enough. Eventually, a second person helped with check-in but by the time he turned up, most of the queue had been processed.The demeanour of both receptionists was, in a word, 'robotic'. No trace of warmth or genuine courtesy. We and our fellow travellers were just items to be processed as quickly as possible with as little interaction as possible. I witnessed a terrible episode involving an Asian couple who had travelled with us on the shuttle bus. After standing in line for 10 minutes and presenting their paperwork, they were told they were in the wrong Mercure Hotel. Their's was in the city. The couple had little English and the female receptionist did the absolute bar minimum to assist. She spoke to them like they were idiots and pointed outside the front door. Eventually, she ordered them a taxi but that was after several bewildered looks from the stranded couple. Their mistake was understandable and should have been handled with more diplomacy.Our non-smoking room had been smoked-in and the alleged refurbishment was at best, modest. We were too tired and Peed Off to complain and just wanted to hit the sack. The next morning, I told the receptionist about the smell in the room so that they could fumigate it. Her response? No sorry, no thanks for lettting us know. The best she could muster was well why didn't you complain when you checked-in last night! That's it, verbatim. Unbelieveable.We made the right decision the night before when we resolved not to stay a moment too long in the hotel, electing to eat breakfast at the airport rather than the downstairs restaurant. The last straw was the shuttle bus journey to the domestic airport in Sydney for our connection home. The driver was a lazy jerk who treated the bus load of guests like a major inconvenience and he drove like a maniac. Lots of hard acceleration and hard braking making the trip both uncomfortable and at times, nerve racking.Overall? Lousy service and attitude.

I was very surprised to hear a knock on the door within 5 min and it was fixed.\u9225\ue534O MINIBAR IN THE ROOM. I thought this was great! There are fully stocked minibars located near the lifts on each floor. You simply go to reception and ask for a \u9225\u6deamartbar\u9225?card and you swipe the card and grab what you like and pay upon check out.

Room service was I thought very pricey for what it was eg: $14AUD for a bowl of wedges, $12AUD for a piece of mud cake.\u9225\ue53de ended up having to buy food whilst shopping in the city and also bringing back extra food to the hotel to eat. Other options we did was to take the hotel shuttle to the Int. Airport and eat in the food court area.
