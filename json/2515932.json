It's a beautiful resort. Hopefully they will be able to continue to go forward with more towers when the economy picks up again. They had a great vision with this project. The staff are friendly and very accommodating to your needs. The pools are great. The marketplace very nice. We have nothing negative to say. Can't wait to go back again. We booked our room getting HGVC \"open season\" rates since we own a timeshare at HGVC Seaworld. I thought $100 per night for a 2 bedroom deluxe room was a great deal, considering you would pay more that this to stay at your local holiday without all the amenities that the Parc has to offer. This resort is within 5 - 10 minutes of all the major theme parks, stores and restaurants but you will need to have a car to get around.

At first we were all excited but after the first day we wished we were at the International Drive location. The pool is beautiful with the water slide, that my daughter enjoyed but that's it. It seems as though they also do more activities for the kids at ID than at Parc Soleil. I bought tickets from the Concierge for Islands of Adventure and realized when I got to the park that we paid $11 more per adult and $6 more for our daughter ~ as if the parks don't cost enough as it is. The food at the restaurant is very good but the bar itself is very small. The one on ID is def. much nicer with a great resort feel. The rooms were very nice but again, ID is much nicer. The ones at ID have jacuzzi tubs in the bedroom, no jacuzzi tubs here. The kitchen is also smaller here. We ordered a high chair and pack n play from house keeping, which was great that we didn't have to travel with them, only thing they took a while to come. Regarding what everyone is referring to as the resort being in the middle of nowhere, it does feel like this. The resort is by itself down a lonely road. I'm sure this area will be built up soon, but for now there isn't much going on in the immediate area. It is close to all attractions and driving distance to stores and restaurants, etc. This is another reason we prefer the HGVC on International Drive. The outlets are right behind it and there is a path that can take you right to them so there is no fighting for a parking spot on a busy day. Publix is right across the street along with Outback, Mcdonald's and other restaurants. ID also has a Pizza Hut on location along with a kiddie spray area, the run through kind. There is a projected plan for 7 buildings total... I hope they plan to add more pools or at least one more bc as of right now there is almost not enough lounge chairs for the 2 buildings they have, let alone 5 more buildings with many more ppl.

We just stayed here for five nights on a time share exchange. We loved it! We had a one bedroom unit on the 12th floor of building two. Our balcony overlooked a huge vacant lot. Not the most scenic thing to look at. But then, look to the horizon and you can see Magic Kingdom in the distance. We watched the Wishes fireworks every night except for one right from our balcony. We were at least 5 miles away, but we could see the fireworks perfectly. When we looked to our right, we could see Universal, Orange County Convention Ctr, The Fun Spot, etc. from a distance. 5 miles or so. Looking to the left, we could see in the distance Epcot, Swan & Dolphin, and Tower of Terror. We could also see a bit of Downtown Disney. The pool area was wonderful. We enjoyed the quiet pool even more. Pools & whirlpools were open from 7-11 daily. There was a washer & dryer right in our unit. Nice little market near the pool along with a cafe. We never went to the cafe though. We found the location to be great. We were able to use the backroads (Palm Parkway) to get to Disney or Universal. Sea World was just around the corner. There is absolutely nothing within walking distance of the resort, so a car is most helpful. The resort was also close to the Premium Outlets just on the other side of I-4. Very easy drive to get there. The closest attraction for us was Downtown Disney. Staff of the resort was very friendly & helpful to us. Very nice place. We were called once to see if we would like to attend a sales pitch. We said no thank you, and we were not bothered again. Covered parking in garage is available. I would not have liked to stay on one of the lower floors as some of the balconys were right above part of the garage that was open air. We didn't have any face cloths in the room at first. I called house keeping the next morning and asked for some. I said no rush. Then I went downstairs to walk around the pool area.

We have stayed in hotels, motels, rental homes, and onsite at Disney. So I think I am more than qualified to give a good honest review of this hotel. First of all, due to my mix up, we arrived a day early. And it was Spring Break. As I stood at the check-in, I was frantically wondering where on earth we would end up, because the hotel was full, and so were many others due to the time of year. Luckily, they moved us into the penthouse for one night until our reservation began the next day. For a normal rate, not the penthouse rate. Everyone at the front desk was very gracious. In fact, every employee I encountered during this stay was very friendly and helpful. Staying here gives you the best of both worlds. You get the convenience of a condo, but the amenities of a hotel. We had a 2 bdrm unit, fireworks view. That was so nice. Most evenings as we got the kids ready for bed we enjoyed watching the EPCOT and Magic Kingdom fireworks. My kids loved the hotel. They really enjoyed the game room, and the pool. There is a nice water slide that they had fun on. Even my teenager had a good time. She actually showed an interest in doing the things the hotel would offer every day, something we normally don't see from her. The hotel plans several things per day to keep kids and their parents entertained, such as a Mario Kart contest, a tie-dye shirt session, music trivia by the pool, a not-so-newlywed game, etc. There is plenty to keep you occupied right here. And the on-site restaurant is very good. The pool is heated to a comfortable temperature, and there are 4 hot tubs scattered around so you are not crammed in one with a ton of people. The pool also has a beach entry, which is great for toddlers. And there are some small fountains at the entry that the little ones can splash in. But you also have the condo convenience of bringing in your own food, cooking it there, etc. As for someone complaining about the maid service, they tell you that there is none unless you stay for 7 days then you get one day of cleaning. If you rent a house or condo normally, there is never any maid service. BUT, if you need new towels, they will gladly come and trade them out. We had 6 people in this unit, and each room had a king bed, including the couch. I have never seen a king size fold out couch before. This worked great! Yes, you need a rental car. But you need that anywhere you stay in Orlando unless you are onsite at Disney and have no plans to do anything else. It was actually nice being away from the maddening crowd. To be so close to Disney, yet have no crowds or traffic around was something we have not experienced before. Also, it was nice having a parking garage. One day it was raining, and we comfortably walked to our car and got in, unlike in other places where your car is exposed to the elements and you run for it and get soaking wet. The beds were very comfortable, and the pillows were great too. I did not like the provided shampoo, it had a very manly smell. I smelled like my dad after I washed my hair! The elevators are very speedy which is nice. No long waits there. We stayed in bldg 100 and had no issues with sound from neighbors. There is a nice mile-long path around a pond, and I saw people on it at all hours.

I guess the garage parking is good for summer heat. The hallways are wide, but stark of decor. We stayed in a \"King Studio\" that was zilch of any luxury. Cheap wood laminate floors greet you. Then there is the \"mini kitchen\" with a mini fridge, bare minimum utensils/dishware and minimal storage space. Then there is a king bed two end tables, wall lamps, bistro table and two chairs, console and flat screen tv, teeny closet. There is no where to place your luggage (no racks) so you have to lay them on the floor. The closet barely holds anything. The bathroom, while large, has no place to hang a towel, sit down, get dressed. Oh did I mention we had to run the water for more than 10 minutes to get any hot water? Did I mention that housekeeping is slim to none - we had to call after 6pm to report no cleaning done? Add to that the HVAC that sounds like a jet taking off. Oh, and when anyone flushes, you think there is target practice going on in the surroundings! Yet, I have seen ratings here and other sites that still give this place 4-5 stars. Why?

In all, we stayed for 5 days and 4 nights. It was funny reading other reviews of this place before we left . . . . I warned the kids about the speed of the water slide . . . and our kids actually got stuck going down because the water pressure was so slow/low . . . so I think that they have been reading feedback and have turned it down?? Also, there are LOTS of things close by for shopping and eating . . . it is immediately surrounded by fields/future construction sites for Hilton Grand Vacations, but by no means is it in the middle of nowhere. It was just a few minutes from all of Disney. It is very close to Downtown Disney and many other restaurants. I think the longest it took to get to any of the parks was 15 minutes . . . and that was because of bad timing at traffic lights. We ate at the restaurant on site and used the on site market to buy some breakfast items so we could eat in our room each morning. Good food at fair prices at the restaurant, and elevated prices at the market, but not so elevated that it made me want to leave and go grocery shopping somewhere else. You are paying for the convenience. The rooms/apartments were very nice. We had a two-room suite in tower one, which was essentially a one-room suite with an adjacent studio suite that opened up to the main living room area of the one-room suite. It was huge. Two-bathrooms, full kitchen (and a small kitchen in the studio). More space than we really needed, but it was really nice to have with three kids. The best part about the room, was the washer and drier. So nice to be able to pack less and be able to wash clothes! The kids activity center was wonderful. No joking, our kids wanted to leave Disney early so they could get in on some of the events and activities going on at the Resort . . . There was so much for the kids to do: wii, playstation 3, arts and crafts, hair braiding, karaoke, ping pong, pool, family water Olympics, basketball, tennis, board games . . . you name it, they had it. I think they even offered a SCUBA class in one of the pools. For every activity that the kids participate in, they get stamps in their resort passport. Once they have so many points, then you can cash them in for a prize (similar to Chuck E. Cheese prizes). The 90 minute time-share presentation itself was very enlightening . . . they do the time-share thing very differently . . . you work with points and not weeks . . . . But at any rate, besides that 90 presentation, we were not pressured or asked about joining Hilton Grand Vacation Club again. The only bad thing I have to say about Parc Soleil, is that just after we checked out on our final morning, we realized that we left our boys two brand new light-sabers in the cupboard above the fridge. It was too late for us to turn around and go back, so I called and asked them to mail them to us. I knew exactly where they were when we left and gave that info to the lost and found office. They said they would be willing to mail them, but that none were found in our room or in the specific place I asked them to check above the fridge. Basically, I don't fully trust the cleaning staff, and they must have stolen them. So be sure to use the safes inside the closets for valuables, and TRIPLE check your room before checking out.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gainesville, Florida", "Title": "\u201cnot one bad thing i have to say\u201d", "Author": "Andreamelo", "ReviewID": "UR126183000", "Content": "staff friendly, great clean rooms, games room for the kids is awesome, pool area worth every penny", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sarasota, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAlways a nice stay!\u201d", "Author": "Beth0313", "ReviewID": "UR126083146", "Content": "We've stayed in several hotels around the Orlando area and this seems to be our favorite.

We stayed for a week here at the resort. Beautiful! Reasonably priced! Excellent location! A 5 minute drive to Disney and main streets filled with restaurants and stores so the people that said the location was far away from necessities need to reevaluate.Our one bedroom suite had everything you could need. The bed was super comfy, the pools were great, the staff was fantastic. Our room was next door to the laundry room on our floor which made me very nervous considering some reviews saying the walls were very thin and we didn't hear a peep from outside our room the entire stay. We stayed in tower 2 the newer one which was very modern and clean and we had a lovely view of the pool below as well as parks and fireworks in the distance. There was one mention of a time share presentation at check in and then one phone call later that day but that was it. We did not experience any pushiness at all that some mentioned. There was a strong food smell in the parking garage that some people mentioned but it didn't bother us at all aside from the fact it made us hungry :) I was very happy with the recycling bin located right at the door in the parking garage before you enter the building. Was very nice to see. The elevators were super fast which was fantastic! With anything however there is room for improvement so a few suggestions... Our biggest beef was one nite in the pool they were bringing out the inflatable movie screen and were going to play one of my daughters favorite movies, Rio. We were planning on eating at the restaurant beside the pool, outside so we could watch the movie. There were SEVERAL tables outside with dirty plates and empty glasses on them and when my husband inquired he was told some families were \"still using\" the tables. Well we were in the pool for 2 hours and nobody sat there once so why not give another family a chance? Was really not impressed with that. As far as I'm concerned if you want to \"keep\" a table for hours you should be sitting at it, and ordering food, drinks etc. Also lots of ppl taking up tables sitting for a few hours after having a drink or meal. Can't you sit in one of the million lounge chairs instead and let another family have a turn? Surely there can be a better way to serve people. We ended up ordering in from a restaurant. Another thing was water pressure in the shower was poor. For someone with very thick hair like myself it takes forever to get the shampoo out. Was very excited to see two shower heads in the shower as well only to find out one did not work :( And lastly, one small suggestion is to put some kind of step stool in the washroom. Being a family resort it would be a great investment. the sinks were too high for my daughter to reach anything so we ended up pulling an ottoman in from our room to help. Would be a good idea. All in all we were far more impressed then not and will be returning.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northwood, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cHilton's big mistake paid off for us in the end\u201d", "Author": "ohnostargazer", "ReviewID": "UR125894513", "Content": "We bought a Hilton Grand Vacations Package for 3 nights at a Hilton in Orlando. I made the reservations and had our timeshare appointment set up months in advance. After being at Disney's Fort Wilderness campground for almost 2 weeks, we were looking forward to a nice hotel room. When we got to the Hilton we booked, they couldn't find our reservation. After checking everything and being on the phone for a while with Hilton Grand Vacations, the lady on the phone told me we had to go to another hotel. She sent us to Parc Soleil, a little further away from Downtown Disney than I had wanted or planned. After an hour of all this and then driving to find the Parc Soleil, we got there, a little worse for wear. When we walked in, everyone was very nice, the hotel itself looked very nice. They were having problems with their computer system when we were checking in, and the young girl helping us could see we were frazzled, so she offered us some water and snacks while the manager tried to fix the problem. After a few minutes we were all checked in and given directions to our room. We parked in the parking garage and headed up to our room. When we got to our room, we were pleasantly surprised. It was a studio room (the original hotel was a plain HIlton and we were supposed to get a room with 2 double beds and that's it). It was very spacious. The bathroom was huge, there was a lot of open space. There was a table and 2 chairs, a king size bed, a nice big window that we could look out of and watch the fireworks at Epcot. There was also a little kitchen area which included a sink, micorwave, fridge, coffee maker, toaster, and some dishes, dish towels, and dish soap. The next day we checked out the pool area, the restaurant, the market, and some of the activities. The restaurant and marker were a little pricey, but you can expect that somewhere like this. The pool looks nice, but isn't as big as it looks once you get in and see there's an area roped off for the slide and with the fountains running, it really reduced the size of the pool. On a side note, after reading other reviews that says the waterslide is pretty intense, my husband went down it and said it is pretty fast, so it may not be great for young children. We did the timeshare presentation, which they told us was only 45 minutes, but of course it was much, much longer. The lady was pushy even though I was promised it wouldn't be pushy (like I would actually believe that). While we were waiting for our presenter, we were given hot dogs, chips, donuts, snacks, and drinks though, which was nice. We did a few activities, mainly snow cones and Bingo, which was nice. I like having some activities around the resort to do, even though we don't have kids with us. Overall, the hotel is very nice and I would definately stay there again if the price was right. Right now they only have 2 buildings, but are planning on 5 more in the future. The hotel is literally in the middle of a field right now. There's nothing else around, but everything is very close. Downtown Disney and all the surrounding stuff is only 5-10 minutes away. I really liked staying here. It really was a vacation. One of the days we were there, we didn't even leave the resort (which is rare for us).

My husband, 2 yo daughter, and I stayed in a 2 bedroom/2 bath lockout. The accommodations were very nice, clean, large, and well appointed. The towels were thick and soft and the beds were comfortable. Traveling with a 2 yo, it's always nice to have a washer and dryer in the room. The pools were also very nice and kept at a comfortable temperature. We didn't eat onsite since there were so many restaurants close by in what we heard referred to as \"restaurant row\" along Sand Lake Rd, about a 5 minute drive from the resort. There were several grocery stores also within 5 minutes, and a nice Whole Foods (which is where we did our shopping) just a few minutes away. I would guess it's safe to say that we're sushi snobs, and we found a great sushi restaurant just off of Sand Lake, called Nagoya Sushi. They accommodated our daughter very well and the food tasted great and was very fresh. It also was a quick and easy drive for us to get to Downtown Disney, Hollywood Studios, and Magic Kingdom. The property does sit all by itself. Initially it was a little off-putting, but we ended up appreciating how quiet the area was and we had a nice open view from our balcony. Also as others have mentioned, you do hear noise from your neighbors. I couldn't hear talking or tv noise, but I could hear someone above us moving chairs around and walking with hard soled shoes. Part of the problem is the hardwood floors. After we noticed the noise, we just tried to be mindful of what we were doing in order not to bother the people below us - no big deal. We always travel with a white noise machine for our daughter, so in her room we couldn't hear anything. As I said, we did sit through the timeshare presentation. It wasn't anything terrible at all and took about 90 minutes. The sales person was friendly. He certainly did his job by trying to get us to buy. We are respectful of the fact that that's how he puts food on the table for his family, so we listened to what he had to tell us but then told him we weren't interested.

We've stayed at this resort most every time we've visited Orlando in the past few years--about eight to ten nights a year--and only once did we not have any problems. Everything from not getting the room we reserved, housekeeping not having the room cleaned when we returned after 6 p.m., some of the linens for the sofa bed missing, our room not ready for check-in till well after 6 p.m., loud music at the pool and lax safety precautions. This past visit last weekend topped them all. For the first time, I reserved a studio room because it was only my husband and myself and I was using Hilton Honors points to pay for it. My only requests when I check-in is that I have a high floor away from the elevators. My choices were either ground floor or a room on the 14th floor. I chose the higher floor and found I was about 20 feet away from the elevators, but on an end where there wouldn't be much traffic. Since this was my main concern, I gave no thought to the ringing of the elevators. My first mistake. After entering the room, I found that the safe was locked and missing one of the numbers on the keypad. I wish that at that point I had asked for another room, but didn't want to take my chances on the ground floor room and the noise. When leaving the handicapped parking on the first floor of the garage that evening for dinner, we found that two cars were parked in a no-parking area that was reserved for maintenance and/or to also allow a car to back-up out of the handicapped parking spaces in this dead-end parking area. Luckily, we had earlier backed into our space and therefore, didn't have to drive in reverse to exit the parking garage. This isn't anywhere near the first time that security has allowed people to park in spaces where it wasn't allowed. Upon our return around 11 p.m., we pulled back the bedding to find a large depression in the center of the bed--a sinkhole of about 6 inches. I called the desk to notify them of the problem and was told that they would send maintenance up to check it out. Upon removing the mattresses from the bed, it was found that the center support for the bed was broken as well as two of the three lateral support beams. After attempting to jerry-rig the center support, the two maintenance men left to see what they could do about fixing or replacing the lateral support beams. After they left, we inspected what they had done and realized that as soon as we put any weight on the bed, that the center support would then give way and again, bend any support beams in place. I called the desk again and was told that there were no rooms available at all in the building we were in and that if we wanted another room, we would have to transfer to the other building on the property. I told her that was not satisfactory and would wait to see what the maintenance people would do. When they returned, we showed them that their \"repair\" would not work and they finally agreed. I could not believe that on this entire property that there wasn't another bed frame they could bring up to replace ours, but there wasn't. They ended up pulling out what was left of the base and we placed our mattresses on the floor. Since it was now well after midnight, I thought that we might now get some sleep but then again I was wrong. With the television off, one could easily hear the pinging of the elevators ALL NIGHT LONG! Although I usually check out via phone, this time I went to the desk and complained about all the problems we had. I was told \"Sorry about that\" and that was it. In summary, the grounds are pretty, the suites are large and spacious, and the room rates are usually pretty good for what you receive. However, when your room isn't ready at check-in time, it isn't the room you reserved, when you can't find a parking space in the evening in the garage for your building, your room isn't made up upon your return from a long day at the parks, you only have 4 bath towels in a 4-person suite, you don't have the proper bedding for the sofa-bed, the safe won't work, the bed is broken, and the loud elevator keeps you up all night, just to name a few of the ones I easily remember, NO ONE WILL CARE because they know you will be back because the grounds are pretty and the suites are large and spacious and the room rates are pretty good.

We both agreed, saving a couple bucks in a cheap hotel is just not worth it. Next time we'll call Parc Soleil first and enjoy our vacation from the first day.

Once two years ago when nearly new, and the second visit just last week. I have a family of four, with two kids age 5. First, the staff is superb in the lobby, in the pool area, and in most places around the hotel. It is hard to beat their level of service and I would equate it to a top tier resort. The pool area with its two pools and five saunas is well maintained and kept up. The one water slide is very fast - so fast it scared my five two year old daughters. Great slide, but young kids can be frightened by it. The playground next door is also a great facility, as my girls loved it with the well padded astro-turf. They may trip and fall down, but when they are ready to cry, they realize, \"Hey, that did not hurt!\" The elevators in the buildings are quick and efficent. The hallways are nice as is the lobby. The rooms are another story. The furninture we noticed after our first visit was a little beat up. After the second visit, much more beat up. It is nice but not holding up well. In addition, the cleaning staff has been cut back on (probably because the time shares are not selling well - more on that in a second). So cleaning for a seven day stay is only one day. The other six days they will make the beds and change the towels if you ask. The problem is the kitchen. We came and it was barely clean. The dish drainer by the sick was absolutely fility. It took two calls for someone to come up, look at it, and tell us they would bring up a new one. The new one the drainer was clean, the silverware pocket had food in it! We gave up. Dishes and silverware were in the main tray to dry. It is unfortunate as the rooms have some nice touches. Televisions in every room, in the one bedroom unit, you get a tub with a faucet in the ceiling as well as a separate shower. In the studio, you get a standard hotel room but with the high end tile that comes in the one bedroom, losing the bathtub and one of the two sinks. The one bedroom has a full kitchen. You can make anything you want in it and in addition, they have grills outside you can use. We used them one time buying the charcoal at Winn Dixie for $3 (or you can buy it from Hilton at the nice store they have on site for $7). You call up the staff and they put out the charcoal when you are done so you don't start a fire. Again, the excellent service. We got the sales pitch both times to buy a time share. However, for the high prices to sign up and then the maintenance fee every year you pay for about $1000 or more, it does not make sense finanically no matter how you cut it. Right now, I can go online to hilton.com and use it like a hotel now since they cannot sell the units. The one bedrooms are for about $200 a night, the studios a litlte more than $100 - or a standard hotel rate. So I can stay in that hotel in a one bedroom for 5 nights for $1000 - or about the maintenance fee for a week per year if I purchase the time share - not counting that $10,000-$20,000 I have to pay up front. To save two days on a on bedroom hotel room per year, or $400, it is going to take me a very long time to make up those thousands I put down up front. They try to sell you on the \"guaranteed vacation for life,\" but basically you are locked into Hilton or their partner properties, and the payoff can take as long as 50 years. So you never break even on this \"vacation investment.\" Your kids might beneift if you bequeth it to them,but then they are saddled with the annual fees. So for a short visit and if you can deal with the declining quality of the rooms, everything is great. For a long term investment, stay far away.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cAnother good stay\u201d", "Author": "Gracie99uk", "ReviewID": "UR124270489", "Content": "This is the third time we've stayed at the Parc Soleil (April '10 and May '11 previously).

The bed was nice and comfortable but there was no real wardrobe space so we lived out of the suitcases mostly. The air conditioning was so noisey we just turned it off. Overall the room was fine but as the aircon was so bad we turned it off and turned on the fan on the celing and WOW we were covered in white dust and fluff, it seemed to come from the top of thefan and under the bed when the fan was blowing but of course we turned it off asap. What i did find that over the 4 days i had a dreadful sore throat which i thing was caused by this dust. Hopefully they will clean fans in the future. Ignoring the dust the biggest problem is the walls were just not sound proofed, i knew what people were discussing in any room to the side or above/below and toilet or shower was so easy to be heard, infact we would be woken by direct neighbours flushing. My wife was in the bathroom on one occasion and she accidently had a conversation with the neighbour through the wall thinking she was talking to me through the door, i was in hysterics as i could hear both from the bed :) but seriously the sound proofing was a big issue.

I will start with the good. Areas where they can improve then another good. First \"good\": This is hands down this is a beautiful resort. You receive a good impression when you first drive up. It's gated which is great. There is a beautiful circular drive way. Well appointed lobby as they say! This is far away from the Disney part of Orlando where you will not see glaring lights or Mickey and Minnie all over the place. You truly get a resort \"feel\" when you stay here. Areas where they can improve: The place where their restaurant is located does not have doors too keep cool air out. There are two doors on the side. In the summer time,this will be appreciated. For January and probably February, it's a bit chilly and you will need a jacket or a heavy wrap to wear if you decide to eat dinner there. Somehow our food stayed warm but I wish they had designed doors. What they do have are those \"garage door\" type enclosements. If they pull them down then it would give the appearance of the place being closed. The food choices though are pretty good and reasonable for a resort of this caliber. You will find the staff at this eatery to be cheerful (even if they appear to feel the cold too...they just smile through it) and also very knowledgeable of the dishes being served and the wine list. Another good: Yes you may be invited to sit through a sales presentation but you might not be sorry if you did. My husband and I want with our pre-planned game faces on of \"no matter what they show us...we are not buying\". We sucked! We bought. We were overwhelmed by their well appointed one bedroom and two bedroom options. We found out we were staying in their efficiency which is actually a third bedroom. Each bedroom has a bathroom so no awkward sharing. This is a great option for parents or families that travel with in-laws or friends. If you have kids (especially) girls who cannot stand sharing bathrooms or bedrooms, you will be the best parents ever if you get the bedroom. Speaking of kids, yes they do run around. This resort does provide an adult swim area and hot spa pool. You can let the little ones swim or if they are doing another activity on the premises you can enjoy the adult pool. They also have a fabulous workout facility with enough treadmills for all. There is also a private jogging path. No worries of dodging cars or running in an unfamiliar area. It's well lit at nite but as a female I still would not do it alone. You may now want to buy but talk to Felix. He is as \"unsaleman\" as they come. Nice guy and not pushy. I've sat through some of these previously and for some reason this was not a horrendous experience. If you have grandchildren but don't want to stay on a Disney property then I would recommend this place. It's great if you know you will be bringing the kids or grandkids for a while to the Orlando area. When you add the cost of a regular hotel vs. this place plus all the space you will get...it's worth sitting through the presentation. BTW-their kitchens are great so you can really save on food.

We wanted to try out this resort, since we had previous stayed at all of the other HGVC resorts in Orlando. We were pleasantly surprised with this property. We asked for a fireworks view and got a unit in the 2nd building where we were able to watch the fireworks from Epcot and Magic Kingdom every night. Since we were there through New Year's we got an additional full night of fireworks in every direction. The amenities at this resort are wonderful. My kids have grown up in HGVC are are familiar with the activities centers, but this one is set up for maximum entertainment. The gym is state of the art and is open 24/7. There is a great view from the gym of the pool area. They provide headphones to listen to the televisions which are embedded in the equipment. There are Pilates balls and free weights as well. Our unit was on the 6th floor and did overlook the parking garage if you looked downward. This is only a problem if you are on the balcony a lot and you hear some noise from people getting out of their cars and such. I can see it possibly being a problem from lower floors. The restaurant and bar area were good. We ate a fixed price menu for Christmas Day and it was excellent. We only had one little snag with housekeeping (they didn't clean our room when they were supposed to), but when we brought it to their attention they came up right away and did a tidy-up. Came the next day and did a complete cleaning plus they sent a basket from the marketplace with cheese, crackers, water, tea, fruit, etc. and an \"I'm sorry\" card signed by the entire staff. The activities crew here is a real stand out. We only went to the parks one day, so we spent most of the time relaxing at the resort. Christopher, Jonathan, Ryan, Xavier and the entire activities crew are just really fun to be around. They really enjoy their jobs. The four of us stayed 8 days in a one bedroom (kids slept on the fold out couch). The fold out couch was very comfortable and the master bed is super comfortable. The kitchen is state of the art and there is a Publix just under the I-4 on Central Florida Parkway, past Sea World. We were able to combine our points with open season and stay 8 wonderful days at this resort. I did not want to go home. The only bad thing about this place is that it is going to get further developed and the new buildings are probably going to block the views and the public areas will be more crowded.

We called the desk for assistance and found it easily from that point. \"Desforges\" is not likely to be listed on your GPS if you have not updated your maps recently... The location of the property is quite good for day trips to Disney, Sea World or Universal and is quite close to I5 (and unfortunately the Orlando Premium Outlets). It appears to be in a as of yet undeveloped pocket along I5, and only two of the six towers have been built to date. We had booked our trip through the Hilton Honors service line, and knew that we were accepting a discounted rate as long as we attended a two-hour timeshare sales session late in the week. We were not bothered at all during the week and the session itself was professional and comfortable - but not terribly succinct. Our one-bedroom suite was wonderful. We used the kitchen daily to prepare breakfast and lunch, packing our lunch for consumption at the Disney parks. We did eat dinner one night and breakfast on our last morning onsite, and found the food to be very reasonably priced and quite good. Connected to the restaurant was a convenient little store, complete with a coffee and wine shop. The main pool, located adjacent to tower #2, was wonderful. Our toddler loved the zero-entry pool and fountains. There was also a very nice playground located next to the pool - and we biked and walked along the long path around the lake one morning. The towers do indeed have parking ramps below them - a great convenience, as long as you don't drive a large SUV or arrive back at the hotel quite late. One night, we tried to re-enter the tower, trying three different locked entrances before walking through the parking garage to enter.

We were very happy with the property overall. Everything from an elegant lobby check in to the efficient elevators made our trip hassle free. Our room was on the top floor (15th) that is accessible only with your room card. I'm not sure what the penthouse level offers over the other floors, but the view was pretty spectacular. We were able to spend time on our balcony relaxing and overlooking the pool areas. At night we had a view of the fireworks at Sea World. I believe rooms on the otherside of our tower had views of the Disney area's fireworks. We had a 2 bedroom suite. The second room is separated by double doors that lock, so we had to keep them propped open with chairs (our children are under 3). Everything in the room was fuctional. The kids loved the novelty of the water coming down from the ceiling to fill the tub (there is only a tub in the master bath with a separate walk in shower). The kitchen had all the tools we could need and then some. The internet was fast and easy to use without an extra fee. There was an abundance of pillows everywhere which was comfortable. The beds were comfy, but the mattresses were definitely worn. Overall, it was spacious enough to truly live in. The only down side was that many of the finishes were showing wear and tear already. Housekeeping was sufficient, but they could do a more thorough job. We were never given new sheets, which was disappointing. Otherwise, it's nice to have daily service since other time share properties either don't do housekeeping or charge you a fee. There are 2 pool areas. The main pool has a water slide and is very child friendly. Like a beach, you walk right into the first inches of water and it very slowly gets deeper. There are plenty of small fountains for the kids to splash in. It's large enough that adults can lounge off to the sides peacefully. The secondary pool was usually empty during our early December visit. It was heated and overlooked a walking area with a LED color changing fountain. There is also a semi-covered playground and at least 3 large spas. Throughout the day there are fun activities like a not-so-newlywed game, a DJ, poolside bingo/trivia, etc. The indoor recreation area was also nice. A children's area was full of toys, things to color, and play with. It was quiet and relaxing. There are scheduled activities, but we were always alone in the room when visiting. There is also a teen lounge with Wii and other video games as well as a workout area. Having a restaurant and convenience store with a sandwich/coffee counter was quite nice. The prices weren't outrageous on most items, so we were happy to stay on property to buy items like milk, syrup, and treats. Service was always friendly. The restaurant food was average, but it was nice to sit right next to the pool and lunch. I was happy that there were a few vegetarian choices. The only major hiccup to the whole trip was having to attend a second time share presentation. We had gone to one a few months earlier and were sold their VIP package to try out the properties after turning down the offer to be an 'owner'. We were obligated to attend a second presentation during this trip. We were treated nicely, but it was still uncomfortable having to refuse the purchase. Luckily, after we did get out of the meeting, they never bothered us again during our visit, which I appreciated. The covered parking garage was a great addition. There is also gated access to the property that you can access with either your room key or opened by the gate guard. There is a lot of attention to detail at the Parc Soleil and I'd happily return during out next Orlando vacation. The location is quite central and you're only a few minutes to Disney or Sea World while feeling somewhat isolated from other hotels.

The outdoor pool area is large with a fun water slide that we all enjoyed. Plenty of lounge chairs both in shade and sun. Convenient restrooms also in the pool area. The on-property restaurant was good and not terribly over priced. Our room size was spacious and included a nice table with two comfortable chairs that could be used for eating or business. No desk. The bathroom is also very large with a glass-enclosed shower (no tub). Good brand of shampoos, soaps and lotions.

It is kind of a pain to call and ask for towels and supplies every day plus you need to make your bed too unless you don't mind looking at the mess but this is your main seating area. The biggest problem we had was the powerful odor present in our room that did not dissipate during our 5-night stay. Two floor managers checked it out and said it is just the smell of the cleaners they use and because we didn't have a window that opened there was nothing they could (or were willing) to do about it. We kept the bathroom ventilation fan running 24/7 and the ceiling fan but it really didn't help. The chemical smell was so strong that I had a headache during the entire stay and didn't get a good night sleep. Everyone of our friends who visited our room commented on the bad smell. The little efficiency kitchen is pretty sad. Fridge was tiny, the microwave stuck out of the cabinet over the sink and made it pretty impossible to use the sink.

I visit Orlando once a month for work and several times a month for Disney. Parc Soleil is my absolute number one choice when traveling for business. I prefer a Disney hotel or the Hilton at Downtown Disney for visiting Disney Parks so I can use the extra magic hours. LOCATION: This property is somewhat secluded which is the major point for it being my choice for business trips. The property is centrally located and great if you have a car and will be visiting Disney, Universal, I Drive, restaurants at Dr Phillips, and all the outlets. This is the best location for avoiding traffic to most of the popular destinations. I find this location to be more secure than staying anywhere near I Drive. This property is gated and in response to the previous reviews about this I find accessing this property no different than most gated resorts. They do have security patrolling the property which is way more than you can say about some other Orlando hotels. ACCOMODATIONS: I normally reserve a studio which is more than adequate for me. The studio is a solid step above an average hotel room. The bathroom is HUGE! It has a stand up, glassed in shower and no tub. Personally I like this! The studio also has a mini kitchen with small fridge, microwave, toaster, and coffee maker. I really like this because the kitchen is furnished with utensils. This is super convenient for me. The flooring is laminate and I love this! I hate hotel carpet. Every room I have had here has been super clean. The beds and bedding are always fresh and comfy! They also provide an Mp3 plug in alarm clock. Plugs are also easily accessible. One HUGE bonus is that for a tourist hotel I always find my room here nice and quiet! AMMENITIES: The pools here are spectacular. There is a large pool with a water slide, zero entry walk in, and fountains. There is a huge playground that looks like tons of fun next to the main pool. There is a second pool that is sometimes quieter in the evenings. I believe there are 4 spa pools as well which I always take advantage of after a long day of work. The workout room is larger than standard hotels and for a business traveler in a tourist town this is great. The property is half finished but the walk around the lake is lovely. RESTAURANT: The restaurant is another big point for making this my top choice. This place makes a most phenomenal steak! I've never had a bad meal here and I feel it stands up to some of my favorite Orlando restaurants. The restaurant is open air in front of the main resort pool. After a long day at work I really enjoy having a meal here and relaxing like I am on vacation! The layout actually reminds me of some resorts I've visited in Hawaii. Now to be just a bit persnickety, I would say my one complaint about this hotel is they rarely acknowdge Hilton status and provide no perks for Diamond level members. I know that sounds snobby but when you spend as many nights per year in a hotel as I do, it's the little things that keep you going. Overall, I really like Parc Soleil due to the ammenities, restaurant, clean quiet rooms, and convenient location!", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "chesterfield, va", "Title": "\u201cThe Good, The Bad & The Ugly\u201d", "Author": "postparade", "ReviewID": "UR120432384", "Content": "I will start with the good because there are a few nice things about the property that we did enjoy. First the pool and slide is spectacular for families with kids. It's friendly and shallow enough that you can let them go in themselves and watch from the sideline. The condo units are lovely and clean. They are new so you would expect that from a Hilton property. But the pull out couch was a queen size and the mattress on the pull out wasn't half bad. The marketplace downstairs was convenient and relatively priced which I was surprised about. The restaurant was ok at best and probably could be better but it is what it is. Now, let's start with this. We are Hilton Diamond Club members. We were invited by HGVC to come down on them and view the timeshare presentation and receive our 3 nights free. I took advantage of that thinking they would take good care of us and make sure our stay was wonderful...how far from reality that was. We checked in on a Sunday evening. Our Hilton profile says, high floor, away from elevator...what do we get? Bottom floor which is 4- and right next to the elevators. By the time we got all the luggage in the room and sat down it was kind of too late to move. Plus the man who checked me in said we had a great view and the location of the unit was lovely. Oh...I failed to mention after we walked out onto the terrace that we were right over the 3rd floor parking garage, had a great view of cars, and the view of the crappy, empty lots they have for the new buildings. We saw no fireworks and heard car alarms all night and into the mornings. I was not sure who to complain to since we were on the timeshare side vacationing. Later found out that we should have discussed with hotel management to have the room changed. In my opinion if we are Diamond members, you want to sell me a timeshare, aren't you going to make sure we have the best of everything? Location? Setting? Experience, Etc? Nope. Not to be. My daughter (6) prefers to take baths and after a day at Disney who wouldn't want to? Well the water from the bath was cold so when we got home that evening we had to give her a shower which she was not happy about. the next morning was supposed to be our timeshare presentation so we thought we'd mention it to our concierge about all the issues. so we meet up with her, go listen to the program (which wasn't bad or pushy) and she said she'd talk to the manager. They sent someone up to fix it. Under his breath he commented that the handle and valve were backwards and that if we put it on the \"C\" we would get hot water. He told us it was a quick remedy and he'd be done in no time. So we decide to go to the pool, call the front desk and ask for service since we didn't take it the first day to save on towels, etc. Well we come back 2 1/2 hours later to find, no room cleaning and the man still there fixing the \"so called\" easy valve. I wanted to get my daughter into a warm bath and couldn't. The man was so convinced in the beginning that the \"easy fix\" would be done in no time. Well needless to say it took another 1/2 hour. Furious with the whole thing from the location of the room, to no maid service to no hot water I went to see the manager. She was reassuring and sorry...of course, gave us a $50 resort credit and told me someone would be to clean the room once we had departed for Disney that evening. Thankfully when we got home the room was done. However it took way too long and too much of an effort from patrons who should be treated much better. As a matter of fact she wanted to push me aside so quickly she mentioned they had their \"staff party\" that evening like she was in a big hurry to get out of there. The front gates are a joke. No one checks your passes, no one looks out the window. They simply raise the gate and let anyone in. The parking is terrible and unless you have a VW Mini cooper you aren't fitting your car in the space where passengers can get out. Don't be surprised if you wind up with a few nasty dings in the side of your doors. The restaurant was average. Prices were ok. Food was ok. Nothing to rave about. The worst thing about our stay was how we were treated. No one seemed to care about our issues and everyone wanted to pass it off on someone else. All they want to do is get you in for their timeshare presentation. The staff is unfriendly and common. They don't go out of their way for anyone. They really need to take a lesson from someone on manners. I would not recommend this property to anyone. You can give it a try yourself. Some have had great experiences. I think that ours proves that all you are is a number through the timeshare presentation door and nothing else. They don't care about their Hilton Honors members and that was quite apparent on our trip.

The kitchen has anything you would need to make your own meals, the towels and linens were high quality, and they even provide your coffee for the coffee maker. The service was incredible...we never saw a single staff member who didn't greet us warmly. The marketplace is very convenient, and the prices were actually fair which was a nice surprise. The kids club was a big plus for our daughters. They really enjoyed it and met lots of friends from all over the world during our stay. The only recommendations I have to make it better are to not charge for all the kids activities. There was the occasional complimentary activity, but most are a la carte pricing. E.g., they offered sand art one day but wanted $5 to make one and it couldn't have been more than $1 worth of materials. At least don't try to profit off that stuff...felt chintzy to me. The other is that the kitchen grill vents into the parking garage and at peak meal times the garage gets very smoky and our car always smelled like a burnt hamburger. But beyond those two tiny points, the place is magnificent...and it is very central to everything. I've seen a few reviews saying it is in the middle of nowhere...I suppose if you don't have a car, it would seem that way but it is within 5-10 minutes' drive of anything you would need and an easy trip to all the big parks.

From the moment we arrived at the resort, we received customer service like nothing I've ever experienced before at any resort: the people were awesome. Although spacious and very comfortable, our room, a one bedroom suite facing the pool wasn't exactly as the pictures promised. For example, water did not come out of the ceiling in the bathtub. Our shower was more like a hospital shower and each time we used it water got all over the floor. I found it strange that there was no dresser in the bedroom and no small desk for the phone (and our laptop) in the living room. My husband wished there was a service that delivered a paper on the weekends to the room -- we would have paid extra for that (you do get U.S. Today Mon-Fri). But this is nitpicking, overall, it was very comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked with dishes and pans for cooking and the appliances were top-notch. The pool area was large and chairs and umbrellas were always available. The pool was perfect for my son who is 2.5 yrs old and just learning to swim and the place is clearly popular with families with young children. The pool was shallow throughout and had lots of waterfalls and fountains to play with. There were lots of great activities for kids - a playground, waterslide, activities centre, games throughout the day - bingo and slide races for example - and they even showed movies on a big screen at the pool twice a week in the evening. If your room faced the pool you could watch from your balcony, and other rooms can see the fireworks at Disney each night. The gym was good but not extensive or large. It was equipped with treadmills, elipticals, bikes and weight machines. Towels, water and earphones were provided which I found a nice touch. The general store at the pool was expensive but good for snacks and coffee throughout the day. We only ate dinner once at the restaurant. It was good. Nothing special except for the staff. The staff throughout were top notch and very accommodating towards all our needs. Parking was easy and there were always spots close to the elevators.

There is also a playground right next to the pool that is covered for sun protection. The activity center is tons of fun for the kids. We had one miserable day of nasty weather and the activity center kept their attention the entire day. There is ping-pong, pool, wii, xbox, computers, board games and the best part is the staff. Jordan was awarded the staff of the month while we were there and he totally deserves it! He as a riot, great on the mic and kept the kids (and parents) having tons of fun with all the games they had planned. They do family games, like bingo, scavenger hunts, ping pong tournaments, etc, kids only games and activities like build a bear, and parents only games like pub games, which was a blast. The food at the restaurant was very good, great menu, with good salads, fish, and great kids meals. The deli market is great for breakfast food (the rooms have huge full kitchens) snacks and salads/sandwiches. The work out room is spacious and has great equipment.

Some more umbrellas around the pool would be nice for those who like a bit of shade. These are all small points that did not impact on us too much.

I would prefer anywhere except maybe Libya. I went into this trip with expectations of wishing I was at work, or maybe in the middle of a tax audit; but the Parc made this trip bearable. When we checked in we were immediately directed to the sales table which promised wonderful gifts for just a small amount of my time. Having done to many timeshare pitches, we still said yes, knowing that we would save some amount on Disney Tickets. The pitch was ok, the sales guy Bobby, actually decent. We didn't purchase anything, it took 90 minutes and we were on our way with Disney Tickets for 280 bucks less than we would have paid at the gate. Then we went to our room. We have stayed at many other places that are actually nicer and much more deserving of 5 stars, but this place, in Orlando is really beautiful. The kitchen in the one bed suite is well equipped. Full size fridge and stove, washer and dryer, dishwasher, and fully stocked cabinets. The staff is quick to refill dish soap, laundry soap, and bathroom supplies with a call to the desk. We prepared breakfast everyday, and the occasional lunch or dinner when we returned from the parks. Living room has king size pull out sofa, actually more comfortable than the king bed. The bathroom is big, with tub and separate shower. Also a separate room for the toilet. Full porch with table and chairs were perfect for breakfast. Everything was clean, new, and functioning. The facilities were great: two swimming pools, water slide, 4 hot tubs. Small restaurant was better than the many chain restaurants nearby. My child loved the activities center to the point she was wanting to leave the Disney parks to get home at night to take part in some activity that they were offering. Special thanks to Kim and Jordan who really understand how to keep kids happy (not by feeding them candy, but by listening to them and laughing with them.) Also there is a tennis court and basketball court that no one uses, a walking/jogging path, weight room, pool table, and ping pong to round out the entertainment. I read a bunch of the reviews before exchanging my timeshare for a week at the parc, and the major complaint seemed to be that the Parc wasn't near anything. Because of that I rented a car and that took care of everything. It is true, the Parc isn't near much but in 15 minutes you can drive to Disney or Universal. It is 5 minutes to SeaWorld, 4 minutes to groceries, and 4 minutes to every restaurant chain known to man. I haven't been to Orlando in 10 years, hope I won't be back for at least 10 more, but if I return I will happily stay at the Parc.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Ma", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Parc\u201d", "Author": "Oconnellgang", "ReviewID": "UR117239287", "Content": "We loved the Parc Soleil.

I\u2019m a new owner to HGVC Parc Soleil and I\u2019m so glad I took the leap of faith to purchase here. This place is new, clean, modern and absolutely FANTASTIC! The kitchen was large had all the utensils someone would need for a week long vacation. The bedrooms and living room were spacious. The balcony had a table and chairs which was perfect for the morning cup of joe. The bathrooms are an attraction in themselves. The water for the bath tub comes out of the ceiling! Note: The rooms will get serviced on the 4th day of a 1 week stay. We knew this going in and that is just fine with me. Hotel rooms get serviced every day. I didn\u2019t want to stay in a hotel, so it was not an issue. If I rented a condo from VBO, I wouldn\u2019t have my room turned at all. My family had one unit and my in-laws had another unit across the hall. We all would hang out on each other\u2019s balcony, have a glass a wine and enjoy the evening. The poolside unit had a good view of the pool and downtown Orlando. The \u2018fireworks\u2019 side had a view of Disney fireworks. This was a quieter side because you also see the undeveloped area where future towers will some day be built. I read some posts complaining about this side. Oddly enough, we ended up hanging out on this side balcony more often than the poolside balcony. The staff at Parc Soleil was kind, courteous, and fun! Anyone planning to go to this resort needs to check out the activities calendar. There is so much to do on the resort that we planned around it. The days we spent poolside was amazingly fun. Probably my favorite part. The Parc Soleil recreational team know how to entertain! There were hoola hoop contests, Texas hold\u2019em tournaments, beer games, poolside trivia, face painting for the kids and more. Entering the hoola hoop contest was probably a mistake but I\u2019ll try anything once. Yes, this resort is new and only 2 towers are built. But that is what makes it attractive to me. The pool wasn\u2019t too crowded and we were always able to get a table. The gentle slope into the pool is a nice touch. Also, we all enjoyed the water slide because the water flow was set pretty high and we were able to fly down the slide. That\u2019s the way it should be. The adult pool is set aside away from the main pool so you can read a book or get some R&R without being bothered with all of the hoopla at the main pool. The onsite deli and restaurant was convenient and pretty good! I highly recommend the roast beef wrap. My wife and I had this for lunch just about every day. It was that good. The resort is located between Disney and Universal and a short distance off the freeway. So it doesn\u2019t have a lot of traffic going by and is peacefully quiet at night.

We extended the 4 days in the package and paid the regular \"hotel\" rate for an extra few days. We also paid a little extra for a one bedroom. We know from friends that the yearly maintenance fee for most timeshares, no matter the brand, are not cheap. During the entire timeshare presentation I kept saying to myself that we paid less for our week than the owners paid for their yearly maintenance fee. But, having seen some of the major timeshares out there, Hilton would definitely be our first choice even though they tend to me a little bit more expensive. If we did become owners I would struggle with the fact that random people could just stay here simply by booking a room online like a regular hotel. As an owner I would rather my 'investment' be limited to owners. But, the stay was good. The cleanliness was overall good. No matter where we stay we always have to touch up areas that housekeeping missed. But, for a new resort, I did not expect to see stains on the carpet and the sofa cushions. This could go back to the renters(people who book online) and owners(those who shell out a lot of money). I feel that owners take better care because they will be coming back, maybe even requesting the same room. But the renter has no vested interest. Now we are under the category of renters, currently. But, we are seriously considering becoming owners. Some people had reviews about poor customer service. We found the customer service to be absolutely excellent. Whenever we requested towels or other items, no matter the time of day, they were delivered within 15 minutes. Every Hilton employee we had contact with, whether it be the front desk, housekeeping or maintenance, there were extremely courteous. When we checked in early, a room was ready but we choose to wait for an upper floor with a pool view. Our biggest issue with any hotel or resort is the lack of towel bars or hooks for towels. We believe in conservation but, we need somewhere to hang our towels in the bathroom. Without that we end up putting them on the floor and having to request new ones every day. Actually my husband reused his towel because he used the one hook that was in the bathroom. We really felt that this resort was a home away from home. Having a washer and dryer is such a necessity for a family like ours with young kids. The kitchen table is located in the perfect place because we used it as a folding table for our clothes. The kitchen is very open and bright. The balcony is huge. The tub idea was cute with the water coming out of the ceiling. I would have preferred frosted shower doors that way some one else could be in bathroom at the same time using the sink. There is a sliding door that separates the toliet but, where would the person wash their hands since both sinks are in the same area with the clear glass shower. The parking was interesting. There are more beams in this parking lot than many other garage that we have used. I guess that is because the hotel is on top and they need the extra support. Around some the beams are these metal rectangular things around the base, you will have to squeeze out of your vehicle to avoid hitting your door. The advantage of the Parc Soleil over the Tuscany a few miles away is the slide for the pool. I am not sure how much I will enjoy the Parc Soleil in 5 or 10 years when the other towers go up. Currently with only the two towers, it does not feel overcrowded like other resorts we have stayed at. We really enjoyed our stay. We will stay at the Parc Soleil again. And one last thing, we can not figure out why during the timeshare presentation they were trying to get us to take ownership with a deed on one of their older resorts in another state. The representative said it was to save us money. We like Hilton but, when has a company done something that is financially in the best interest of the consumer.

At our arrival the Hotel facilities exceded our expectations, since we had read the Hotel was located on a isolated area and far from being finished, and to our suprise YES the hotel is located in an unconcluded area but is only a 3 min. drive from many restaurants and populated areas ... anyways the Hotel\u00b4s charm lasted only a few hours... Day after day we kept getting awfull service that ruined our overall experience, here I name a few of the Hotel\u00b4s flaws: 1. On our second day, we left the Hotel around 11.30 am and came back at 12.30 am to find our room not cleaned by housekeeping, when we complained to the front desk (which answered after 3 phone calls) they told us that MAYBE we left the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door... which we DID NOT... and if we had left it on it would still be there when we came back.... obviously it was NOT. 2. Anyways we needed to take a shower since the days over there are incredible hot, but we did not have clean towels since the hotel bathroom does not have towel hangers, you are forced to leave your towels on the floor... so on the same phone call we asked for clean towels and receive them 1.5 HOURS AND 3 ANGRY PHONE CALLS LATER... by then it was around 2.00 am and we were incredibly tired... NOT A NICE EXPERIENCE 3. The shower floor is made of a rough tile which makes it very dificult to clean, and HAIR stays stuck in between them, I noticed that on my second shower and I seriously doubt those hairs where mine or my husbands, also the drain cap is all rusted and uneven... NOT ACCEPTABLE. 4. The hotel does not offer room service. 5. The hotel offers a shuttle that leaves several times a day to the different theme parks, but when we wanted to sign on to the 10.45 am shuttle, the concierge assured my husband he could only make his reservation at 8.00 am that morning (what\u00b4s the point of going on the 10.45am shuttle if you have to be at the reception at 8.00 am making your reservation?) anyways we did the reservation at 10.00 am and there was no problem... why did the concierge wanted us tu be at the lobby at 8.00 am? .... The shuttle service van was awfully smelly and the driver in a horrible mood...

Our check in started off rocky as our room was not ready when we said we'd be arriving. We left, came back a couple hours later, waited some more and it still was not ready at the stated check in time. We ended up with a handicapped room, which was less than ideal, but workable. The downside to the handicapped rooms are the counter heights and the bath arrangements. The roll-in shower left the bath floor a mess (curtain, not door covered the shower) which meant daily laundry to keep up with the towels. I like to cook even on vacation, but the handicapped rooms have the microwave on the counter so there is minimal counter space and working on low counters in hard on the back. Thankfully, those were really our only significant complaints - and if you're handicapped even those aren't negative! We had a lot of rain this trip so we did spend time in the room relaxing and had plenty of space to spread out. There was a DVD player in the living room. Internet worked well the majority of the time. We did spend some time at the pool and love the poolside restaurant bar - enjoy a bite to eat and a drink with the kids enjoy a swim. King bed in the master bedroom was very comfortable as was the sofa bed (memory foam mattress). Parc Soleil is a little off the main streets near Disney/Universal so I'd suggest having a car if you're staying here. Oh - it does have the BEST smelling garage I've ever been in! The grills for the restaurant must vent into the parking garage - yum! They do have limited parkng for taller vehicles in the garage area. There is outside parking as well.

I meant to write a glowing review of this property on our return but that got lost in the daily grind. However I was again pleasantly reminded of this property when I got an offer email from them recently - unfortunately no trip back planned this year, but definitely again in the future. But I had to ad my praises to all others on this site. Parc Soleil Hilton is a diamond in the rough, because as many reviewers have mentioned the two buildings that are currently built were meant to be part of a much larger project that seems to have faltered due presumably to the recent financial downturn. However you can be assured that the two towers that are finished and the surrounding pool area are fantastic! So what you may ask is the 'rough'. Well it's not as bad as you may be thinking - the rough is the surrounding plots where the remaining tours are to be built. On approach to the hotel you pass through this area and it is a little disconcerting. But that is all forgotten when you arrive in the finished part of the complex. Honestly this did not encroach at all on the enjoyment of the complex and apartment for us. Once in the complex the plots for the other towers are not evident or relevant. The complex should have been centered around a lake, the two existing towers are located to the end of this finished lake - but even so the lake area makes for a nice running/walking track and view from the balcony. We found the hotel complex to be the perfect location and distance to the parks, attractions and shopping (both food and outlet shops). Yes it is off the main drag of International Drive, but having stayed on International Drive before this is no bad thing. International Drive can be a little \u2018tacky\u2019. This hotel is away from the hustle and bustle and has quick and direct access to the interstate when trips to the parks or further afield are needed. In reality International Drive is only 5-10 minutes drive away anyway \u2013 if you really must! I did read a review that criticized the garage \u2013 I can\u2019t understand this criticism as the garage was large with many spaces, easy to navigate and had quick direct access to the main building \u2013 what more could you want??? People who can\u2019t park properly, i.e. taking up two spaces, is hardly the fault of the hotel. The quality and size of the apartments themselves can only be described as suitably American in scale. Myself and my wife looked forward to returning to the spacious, cool, comfortable apartment each night after long days in the parks. The apartments are practically new, so the quality and finish of the furniture was top notch. The apartments are equipped with a large, quality kitchen with all mod cons. We found stocking up at the beginning of the holiday gave us alternatives to eating out on any evening we were too tired to venture out. There is a large supermarket about 5-10 minutes drive away that has everything you could need. The dining area had a full size dinner table and six chairs. The main bedroom is spacious and comfortable with a large king sized bed. Bathroom was spacious with both a bath and shower unit and separate toilet - do you get the large spacious vibe - I'll stop with it now :) suffice to say that a family of two adults and two kids would be well catered for here. Also to mentioned - two flat screen TVs with a plethora of stations to keep tired kids entertained when needed. Only one down side was that we couldn\u2019t use the balcony. The aforementioned lake nearby during the summer months did seem to bring out a larger than usual amount of mosquitoes \u2013 even for Florida. So sitting sipping wine on the balcony was a no, no for me \u2013 but again this wasn\u2019t a huge thing for us. For as usual, mosquitoes only really a problem at sun down and sun up \u2013 during the day by the pool, no problem \u2013 especially for my Irish skin which usually attracts them from miles around. The pool area has the main pool with kids slides and pool side bar/restaurant serving decent food and at a reasonable price. There is however to one end a smaller adult pool with sun shielding cabanas for my pale Irish skin! Waiters made regular tours around, so need to budge from the cabana for food or drinks if you don\u2019t want to. One point that I talked to management about was the piped music around the pool - was loud a little harsh at times - they politely turned this down, only to be chastised by another guest who wanted it back up again - horses for courses! In summary, I will be booking here again when we hopefully return to Florida for holidays. Having stayed in a few hotels in and around the Orlando area - for the quality, comfort, location and value for money \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t consider anywhere else better.

Regarding other complaints on this website--those of you staying in studio units really should not complain about no balcony--the studios are lovely and well equipped and really rate much higher in quality than a hotel room. Anyone who complains that their dishes were not done or there was no dishwasher soap is just plain lazy. When you stay at a resort with a kitchen you are basically renting a condo or a home--do your own dishes! As far as the location is concerned--we loved it. Five minutes from Seaworld, 10-12 minutes to Universal and 15 minutes to Disney.

Quiet is important to me while in Orlando because every sense we have is attacked at these parks, so I never opt to stay on the properties.

They said, \"we will take your name off our lists and never call you again.\" So, we said, \"okay.\" I mean, we are not going to be bullied to buy something. What is really funny is that within a few months I had another offer from them for another location. There was still construction going on, but I can tell you this property definitely caught our eye!

We booked a one bedroom suite and got a discount for sitting through their 2 hour timeshare presentation (similar to other timeshare presentations, a really hard sell and the salesman tries to convince you this is the deal of a lifetime - we must be crazy for passing up this investment that you pass onto generations - yeah, no thanks). Back to the hotel. Our suite was beautiful - large living room with a full (eat in) kitchen (granite countertops and stainless steel appliances). Very clean. French doors lead to the king size bedroom. From what I could tell the one bedroom suite costs about $50 more per night than the studio - it is more than twice the size of the studio - and has a balcony (that the studio does not). I think the one bedroom is a much better value than the studio. The pool area is fantastic. Our 6 year old daughter had a great time, loved the water slide. There are also several kids activities in the late afternoon (most cost extra). There is also a separate adult's pool which is a great option to have. We ate dinner twice in the pool side restaurant, I thought the food was good and the prices were reasonable ($8 to $10 for a hamburger with fries, mine was great, I don't eat many hamburgers). Drinks were $8 to $12. There was also a small store next to the restaurant with ready made sandwiches and snacks. We spent much of our time at the pool. Most of the other guests appeared to be families with kids. We really enjoyed our stay here. Presently there are two 'towers' and I believe another 4 are to be built. I sort of wonder once all of those are built if the pool with the water slide might get crowded. Great to have the full kitchen, you can prepare basic meals in your room (we ate breakfast and lunch in our room, saved some $ there). Like any other hotel you can hear noisy neighbors (next door neighbors came back to their room at 1am and heard their loud talking kids for half an hour).

This hotel is no better than a common motel. Sure the rooms are clean, quite new and modern but they are certainly not luxurious. Our main problems with the Parc Soleil were as follows: 1. Despite being a new hotel, the air con is very noisy and even when you turn it off (to try and get some sleep) it still makes a constant noise (which is apparently \"the system refilling itself\"). Definitely not good. 2. All rooms are adjoining so you CAN hear TVs/children from next door rooms. 3. We were told our first room had \"views of the fireworks from Disney\". What they failed to tell us was that it also overlooked very ugly wasteland. As this hotel is in the early stages of development - many of the rooms will have views over wasteland. After we complained we were moved to a \"pool view\" room. It wasn't a whole lot better because the rooms overlooking the pool also overlook the roof of the lower part of the hotels which is similarly ugly and very dirty. There are also no balconies and you cannot open the windows. 4. The water from the taps tastes absolutely disgusting (like pond water) so you will definitely need bottled water. 5. The breakfast restaurant staff were not a very cheery or professional bunch and the breakfasts were decidedly sub-standard and expensive for what you got. Also - no buffet option was available. 6.

They didn\u2019t care\u2026 You can pay $180 and the you can change the room.. God ! The standards of the desk staff and management fall short of expectations\u2026 The only helpful person in this hotel was a technician who was trying to repair the AC and really wanted to help us when he saw that I\u2019m pregnant.

And there are thousands of disgusting bugs everywhere \u2639 You cannot read even one page of the book at the pool because you keep killing bugs. It\u2019s really disgusting. One more thing: forget that nice bathtub with the ceiling faucet they show you - not available in the Studio.

Our children (ages 15, 13, and 11 year old twins) participated in various fun activities which mainly took place at the main pool. They also spent some time in the activity center playing ping pong, shooting pool, and just hanging out w/ new friends. The basketball court is quite a hike however. We didn't eat on premises except for ice cream and wraps from the deli which were just fine. I suppose to some the resort is off the beaten path, but for us we liked not having traffic 24/7 when we ventured out for dinner. There are plenty of restaurants nearby, just not in walking distance.

Being Hilton \"owners,\" we expected high-quality rooms and amenities - it's the trade-off when one buys with Hilton for HGVC's limited locations - and the Parc Soleil didn't disappoint. Location: Reading other reviews, we were expecting the Parc Soleil to be in a very remote location. It was not. Yes, there is a substantial amount of \"green space\" around the resort (presumably for future development), but frankly, after days in the parks, space and peace were somewhat welcome. The only real irritant here is that there is very little in \"comfortable\" walking distance around the resort - one would have to be VERY committed to walking - but there were numerous restaurants, grocery stores, etc., within 1-2 mile radius. This would not have ordinarily seemed like much of a challenge, but the limited restaurant (discussed further below) exacerbated it. The semi-seculded location did contribute to our feeling somewhat more confident in letting the kids go off in pairs without adult supervision. It is an easy drive to Universal (almost a straight shot). Rooms: The three-bedroom suite was more than adequately spacious for our group of three adults and four children (ages 10-14), and the furnishings were all new and consistently high Hilton quality. We had no problems with any of the kitchen appliances, had four (4) flat screen TVs in our suite, and did not notice any exceptional hallway noise or noise from other rooms - and this was during \"Spring Break.\" The master suite was spacious and comfortable, providing a great \"Parent Land\" during our stay. The master bathroom was exceptionally nice. We requested a \"fireworks\" view, and - as other reviews have noted - this was a bit of a let-down. It is accurate to say that one can see the evening fireworks at Epcot, but just barely, and we were on the 12th floor. In retrospect, we would have preferred a pool view. Also, if you are traveling with teenagers who expect their \"own\" bed, be advised that you may need to bring an inflatable mattress and a quarter to flip - beds are kings, queens and - as others have noted - a very high-quality pull-out king. Pool: The pool area is great. Having stayed at the other HGVC sites in Orlando, the Parc Soleil has the best pool. The kids loved the waterslide and there was always plenty of seating in the pool area. The pool was clearly the hub of resort \"activity,\" and the activity staff were constantly engaging kids (and willing adults) in games and activities. To put it in perspective, we rented a room at the Portofino one night to take advantage of the Loew's Express Pass benefit at Universal. This allowed us to spend mornings in the parks, swim in the afternoon and rest at the Portofino, and go back to the parks in the evening. The pool at the Portofino is outstanding; however, all the kids could not wait to get back to the pool at Parc Soleil. Grounds and other Amenities: The fitness center is small, but state-of-the-art, and is easily accessible. The activity center is similarly nice, and our older kids spent a fair amount of time there. The grounds are well-kept, and there is a very nice walking path around a man-made lake. The basketball and tennis courts are new and nice. There is free high-speed Internet throughout the resort. As others have noted, the future expansion \"footprint\" is a bit odd and makes the resort seem initially incomplete; however, we quickly got beyond it. Restaurant: Definitely the low point. The resort's food options are extremely limited, and virtually all of the food options we tried - with the notable exception of breakfast - were disappointing. In a week, we pretty much worked our way through the menu. Popular, easy and \"kid friendly\" appetizers, such as wings and nachos, were missing from the menu. Even the sandwiches were not particularly good. There is no onsite \"mini\" Pizza Hut as at the Tuscany. Other than dinner entrees (representative dinner items - pasta, $16; steaks - $25+), food prices were not outlandish, but the quality simply was not good. Paying $19 for a pork chop on vacation is expected - paying $19 for a pork chop that might be sent back at Waffle House because of poor quality is quite another. Again, this would not normally be as much of a problem in Orlando; however, the resort's semi-secluded location makes everything a drive. Knowing that one will eventually have to get kids out of the pool, cleaned up and drive around looking for food kills the potential of spending the afternoon with umbrella drinks by the pool. We strongly recommend taking advantage of the kitchen in your room - we normally take cereal and other items for breakfast to eat in the room, but rely on restaurants for lunch and dinner (who wants to cook on vacation?). Here, you are better off doing the opposite - bring snacks, sandwich makings, and \"easy to fix\" meals. Breakfast in the restaurant was consistently good. Market: Limited compared to other HGVC resorts. Prices were reasonable for a resort, but the deli was underwhelming and, as with the restaurant, selection was exceptionally limited. While approximately half the staff in the market were friendly and helpful, two in particular - who consistently seemed to work the same shift - often appeared irritated that they were having to wait on guests. If you have any food allergies or picky eaters, you will want to check your orders very carefully. Service: Where provided, great, but the Parc Soleil is woefully understaffed. This was another big difference in Parc Soleil and our experience with other HGVC properties. During our week there, we saw, at most, one server tasked with \"rounding\" the pool taking orders - and remember, this is a huge pool with hundreds of people around it. Drinks took approximately 20-30 minutes to deliver and food was longer. Again, activities staff and servers were friendly and full of personality, but they simply needed more help. An inordinate number of employees working in various positions (serving, bartending) noted that they were \"new to the job.\" Overall: The overall experience was very good, and we will certainly consider going back to the Parc Soleil when we return to Orlando. If the restaurant issues were remedied, it would be a lock - this is a great property. Our kids loved it, and several days after returning, we are still in wonder that they preferred it to the Portofino, which is acknowledged as one of Orlando's premier resort hotels (having spent a week there previously, it merits this reputation). We tried to get a couple of the kids to spend the night with one of us at the Portofino and \"close the park,\" thinking that they would argue over who got to stay and who had to drive back to the Hilton. No one was interested and they all wanted to get back to the Parc Soleil.", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cBetween Universal and Mickeyville - home away from home\u201d", "Author": "Iluvha", "ReviewID": "UR103528276", "Content": "Parc Soleil feels like home away from home with its over-sized condos and warm staff. The two towers flank the pool and restaurant area which is shaded by plenty of umbrellas and palm trees. We booked a 3 bedroom which is a two bedroom with a studio lockout. The king studio doesn't have a balcony (FYI), but the two bedroom sported a huge balcony with one padded lounge chair and a table with four chairs. Ours was in the two-hundred building and we faced west with excellent distant views of Universal and Magic Kingdom and Epcot. The perfect weather gave us clear views of the fireworks each night at 10pm and we could see the Contemporary Hotel, castle and space mountain during the day and at night. A word of caution: If your suite is in Building 200, don't park on the first level since the vent from the kitchen of the restaurant blows out right onto the first level parking and you'll choke from the smoke. Move on up to the second and third levels where there was always plenty of parking for us. The coolest thing in our room: The bath tub in the King Bedroom bathroom fills from the ceiling. Weird. The kitchen cabinets have a slow close hinge that eliminates banging when shut. Wonderfully quiet. Unfortunately, chairs sliding on the hard floor surface in other units could be heard at all hours. We tried the marketplace for a quick breakfast and found made-to-order hot breakfast sandwiches and yummy pastries. Starbucks coffee and a cold drink fridge filled with juices, sodas and water. Or small milk and a bowl of cereal. We tried the Cafe one night and found that it's open all day until 11pm. We had dinner after a particularly exhausting park day. The food arrived at our table piping hot and delicious. Wild Mushroom pasta and Pecan encrusted chicken breast. I can still taste it, yumm-o. If you want to stock up your refrigerator there's a Winn Dixie a mile away. Turn right out of the resort onto Palm Parkway. At the four-way stop, turn right onto Lake road. 1/2 mile down the road on the right is Winn Dixie. If you reach Apopka-Vineland road, turn right and it's right there on your right. The heated pools and plentiful hot tubs provided distraction and relaxation. My only complaint which I will pass on to management is that a pair of mallards had made the reflecting pool their home and swam in it like it was their own private lake even though the property had a walkway around a man made pond feet away.

My trouble with the hotel started before I even set foot in the facility. When I was first contacted to come and see the hotel and stay for a reasonable price I informed the sales person that I would need to stay on the property due to having a child with a disability and would not feel comfortable leaving him and his older brother in a location I would have to drive to if I was needed in an emergency. I was told I would be staying on the Parc Soleil grounds, so I agreed to take the tour. HOWEVER, I received my confirmation letter that stated I would be staying at their Sea World location. Long story short, I contacted numerous individuals, both through Hilton Grand Vacations as well as Hilton Hotels and ran up an extensive complaint report for anyone within the HGV locations to see. Since we had already booked our vacation during our children's spring break, including a cruise, we did not have flexible dates to work with and any other location was booked. I was certain to inform them they had angered me enough that I would NEVER purchase one of their timeshares and that if we were forced to walk through a sales pitch it would be a waste of everyone's time and that I would be sure to inform anyone within earshot of the issues I'd already dealt with prior to showing up. I will give the hotel credit in that the staff was courteous and the room was beautiful. We were able to watch fireworks from our room. Though no fault of the resort, getting to and from the Disney area was horrible. Once you get to the main road, traffic is a mess and it takes a considerable amount of time to drive from one stop light to the next. Another downside to the facility is the incredibly small size of washer and dryer; they're the stackable type and we ended up needing to go through 5-6 loads of laundry for only two days worth of clothes for four people. I'm there to relax, not do laundry. I felt these issues were minor enough and the staff and cleanliness of the facilities were good enough to regain my trust in the Hilton brand, though not this particular resort. UNFORTUNATELY, after returning home from our cruise, I checked my account balance and noticed that money had been taken out of my account by Parc Soleil, one day AFTER we checked out.

I still wished I talked to him more about it, he seems pretty interesting. Great service my man! We checked in at the front desk which was very nice. The person at the front desk gave me a brief rundown of the resort. He spoke for about 5 minutes and gave me information on what they have to offer in a nutshell. It was so much info, but we were not expecting this great level of accommodations. The lobby was so nice and open. Very clean. Our luggage was lost due to our quick connection flights, so he offered us toothbrushes and toothpaste to start with. Normally that service is standard, but he was so professional about it that it made a HUGE difference with the other hotels. He also added that when our luggage arrives, he gave me the option of us picking it up in the lobby, or he'll have it delivered to our room.

Our room was the king studio room. I wanted the king bedroom w/ full kichen, but we also booked it last minute as it was completely booked. The studio wasn't that bad. It's a nice size room. We were in the second building on the 4th floor. We didn't have a great view, but that was okay. The air condition went out on our last day, but maintenence responded very quickly. He said something how the air condition gets locked up sometimes when you turn up the heat. There was a switch in the back that he flipped, and that was that. I love how the hotel is designed for the comfort to the guests. Little things like double doors that separate the elevators from the guest unit floor so it won't be so loud in the hallways. You can specify what time you would like the room to be cleaned each day. This resort had so much activities at the resort itself and peaks that we could not utilitize them all in one week. We organized our day trips in Orlando, but didn't realize that they had a concerge services. Our last day, we were trying to find one more activity to do since we had some more time to fill. We were looking at the pamplets of different things to do, and without asking, a lady at the front desk went out of her way and came over to help us plan our next activity for us. She called the number at different places we were looking at to find out hours, different specials or any other info we had asked. She was very helpful. Again, exeptional customer service. We will definitely stay in this resort in Orlando again. It makes me wander how the other Hilton Vacation Resorts are.

I am a very fussy traveler and found no faults with the room, amenities or service we experienced. We stayed in a one bedroom penthouse suite which was exactly as shown on their website. Our balcony was large, completely private and had a view of the Epcot and Magic Kingdom fireworks each evening. The kitchen was very well equipped (with Cuisinart small appliances and cookware!) and had every amenity we required. All rooms were very large and spacious and there was a washer and dryer in the suite. The king size pull-out sofa bed was more comfortable than any I've ever seen. The fitness center was wonderful, and there was a beautiful 1/2 mile walking trail. Basketball and tennis courts are also provided, as well as an amazing activity center for children. There were many supervised programs and activities for children each day and evening, and the pool/waterslide were a big hit with all. A smaller 'adult' pool and hot tub were available also. It was very nice for us adults to relax, yet our son still get to let loose and have fun. We never had one call from anyone trying to sell us time-share properties. The only fault some could find with this resort, although we found it a total bonus, would be that some of the surrounding area has not yet been developed. Walking anywhere would be difficult; however there were many good restaurants and a huge 24hr Wal-Mart a couple of minutes' drive away.

Being owners at the HGVC on International Drive I tried there first but they were sold out (understandably as this was VERY last minute) Were able to get a 1 bedroom at the new Parc Soleil and decided to try it out. They only had a penthouse available and we were thrilled. As always, we called the hotel to ask for specific directions. We know from experience that Hilton uses their own internal addresses, so in addition to this being new, we were aware of the location issues. The person I spoke to was great and told me EXACTLY what to put in the GPS. Our flight was 2 hours late and we arrived at the resort at 3:30am. From there on out, the experience was all Hilton--first class and spectacular. From the night man at the gate who greeted us; to Diana at the desk--we were tired and she was quick! Building 2, top floor. We were blown away by the room. Our teenage son took the pull out and it was the BEST sleeper sofa we have ever seen. A tempurpedic type mattress on the sofa bed and it was comfortable. We were asleep in minutes. ONLY complaint: walls ARE thin. Room next to us woke us earlier than we would have liked; we were thankful no one above us or to our other side (we had end unit). That should be corrected in the next buildings they build. Our room overlooked the pool and the view was wonderful. Our last day we had breakfast on the lanai and enjoyed the view. We ate breakfast and lunch at the Cafe and I'm not sure where the complaints are coming from. The food was good, hot, plenty to choose from (we thought)and everyone was very attentive to our needs. Its a poolside cafe. It served its purpose well. The pool is zero depth, but has a deep enough area that my son and husband were able to play catch and goof around without interfering with smaller children (which is a plus when you're traveling with teens). Waterslide was terrific for this age group also, but saw plenty of young kids going down also. We asked for a late check out upon arrival and even though this is spring break and they are booked, we were granted a 12:30 check out, which allowed us to enjoy the pool, shower and check out. We were also told that we could use lockers and shower in the fitness center if we cared to stay longer and use the facilities OR the bellman would also keep our luggage if we chose. Everything at this resort is top notch. Yes it isn't finished, but being a brand new timeshare resort, people should know this--they always build these in phases.

First off is a big negitive. WE COULDN'T FIND THE HOTEL!!!!!! We brought our GPS from home (which was fairly new at the time) since we were renting a car and didn't want to pay for one from the rental company. I plugged in the address and it could not be found. I was getting fustrated thinking I was doing something wrong. I then just looked up Hilton Garden Vacation Clubs and it came up with the one on Internations Blvd. so I just went with that one and told my husband we can ask them for directions for our hotel. When we got there the man at the gate told us this was a common problem with people who are using GPS's because it is a newer property. I do put blame on myself for not bringing mapped out directions with us. The hotel is not on a major road so that also can make it a little more difficult to find. Once we got there we were early so we went to see if it was possible to check in early. Our room was not ready yet but they guy at the check-in was very kind in telling us that they will get it ready as soon as possible and give us a call when it was ready. It was no big deal for us. Besides we still needed to eat a late lunch and needed to go to the store for a few things. While at lunch they called us to let us know the room was ready for us. Very impressed that they followed through with that promise. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite that was very beautiful and clean. We had no problems with the room at all. The balcony was nice and overlooked Epcot and Hollywood Studios. We were able to see fireworks at night. The unfortunate part of our view though was the undeveloped area. There is plenty of it. There were only 2 buildings that were built at the time when we went and still plenty of more buildings yet to be built. It's kind of an eyesore but we did spend little time on the balcony so it wasn't a huge deal for us. The property iteself (of what is built) is very pretty. The pool was really pretty. We didn't take advantage of it since it was unseasonably cool when we went. All the employees we encountered were very nice, especially to our two year old twins. I only gave this a rating of 3 because it is unfinished and just not the same as staying in a Hilton Vacation Club that is finished and looks beautiful. It made me wish we had stayed at the one on International Dr. The location of the property is good. Sea World is less than a 5 minute drive. We got to Magic Kingdom in about 20 minutes.

We stayed in a studio suite overlooking the pool in their newest building 200. The good of the hotel: It is brand new, very clean and the desk staff is very nice and generally helpful. There is a fitness center on property along with various areas to grill around the pool deck. Also there is a onsite mini mart that sells coffee and sandwiches as well as one restaurant open from 7am to 11pm at the pool side. The mart was actually reasonably priced which was a surprise for once. Oh also the distance to Disney World is great, hop skip and a jump down the road and your there. The bad: Noisy, lower service then I am used to when staying with Hilton, some amenities seem to be an afterthought. - Noise: We could hear toilets flushing all night along with the TV though our neighbors walls. Now compared to other Hilton resorts we have stayed at or even the Hampton inns we have rarely had a noise issue like this. This reminded me of a college dorm, not good. - Room: Its been said before from other reviewers the room is ok but very bare bones. The studio has a small micro fridge and a microwave which is nice for a few day stay but if you tried to use it as intended for a longer stay it would wear on you fast. Bathroom layouts are not what I expect from Hitlon, the shower makes you feel like your in a glass box, oh wait you are, too awkward for us. - Service: Do note this a vacation club so I do understand that certain levels of service and treatment apply to owners over those just staying a few nights, however that being said there are few issues we had. For starters we requested a late checkout to be extended till 12 instead of 10 am, I was told they couldn't do that as they were booked solid, that was ok but I found out after the fact that a $25 fee would have been charged for late checkout. $25 really......a tad absurd as I've never been charged this at any other Hilton, our honors level even includes as a perk. - On the topic of service there are no free shuttles to any of the parks from this hotel. For a shuttle to Epcot it would be a $6 charge and I'm not sure if this is per trip, I do know you have to pay it everyday you need the shuttle. A free shuttle to Downtown Disney would go a long way to help guest out. - The pool area all together seems like an afterthought, when I'm sorry folks this is a Florida resort the pool should be the showcase and center piece. Instead the pool is nothing more then a few fountains and 1 water slide and a few hot tubs. No pool side food or drink service at all here.The worst goes to the pools towels they were small and cheap feeling and seemed a complete after thought, oh they ask you not to remove them from pool area, ha its march its cold at night, we returned the towels after we changed. - The parking garage is nice and is planned to be built into every building as they go up. But I can see that not everyone is going to fit in the garage and especially won't all fit with the way its laid out, my tiny car has issues fitting in those tiny spots especially when half the spot is taken up by cement pillars. As I've said the Hotel is clean and nice, but I've seen better for the money. I cannot see staying here again for the money I'd rather use Hilton Orlando or Bonnet Creek resorts near by.

The studio is bare bones - do not be fooled. The restroom is embarrassing -- toilet awkwardly behind the door, and a teeny shower. Forget that nice bathtub with the ceiling faucet they show you -- not available in the Studio. Furthermore, you get half (or maybe even less) a window, and zero balcony. AND they make you pay additional for a higher floor or pool view. We paid for a higher floor (suckers), and were rewarded with a view of an unfinished construction area -- an obvious casualty of the economy, yet nonetheless not worth the extra money. Housekeeping did do a nice job, if they made it to your room while you were away. We stayed 3 nights (not counting the 1st), and had full housekeeping only 1. We even called to request housekeeping after they did not arrive timely the prior day (and provided a 5 hour window), yet returned late afternoon to find that they had yet to service the room. We were in for the night, and requested fresh towels, which they did expeditiously provide. To be fair, the pool area is nice and large and has multiple areas for lounging.

We couldn't even roll a luggage cart into this room without moving the chairs away from the dining table. On our second day there, I gave up, called a different resort and we packed and moved. Such a shame to waste an entire day on our once a year vacation! But I would have spent more time at the HIlton trying to find our clothes and shifting things around ... Great for a single or a couple without kids who don't own many clothes! Also, the hotel is on a giant empty undeveloped, unlandscaped lot. Not attractive area at all.

The most annoying feature about this hotel is that unless you get a 900 sq foot room (a suite with full kitchen, separate bedroom and dining/living area) you will not have a balcony. While the suite is a nice room, it is a little excessive for just two people. The first night we were in a smaller (normal hotel) room with a very noisy AC. The next night we asked to move to a different room and then decided to fork over the $50.00 per night upgrade to get the bigger room so that we could enjoy the balcony (It was 5 degrees in Chicago, we figured the upgrade was worth it). The upgrade room was really nice, but they failed to clean the room the next day. This was particularly annoying since we had paid to upgrade. When we complained the front desk person, was not apologetic. She insisted that we had the do not disturb sign on our door and the maid service could not enter. We explained that we removed the sign when we left at 10:30 AM. We also explained that the day before we remained in our (smaller/cheaper) room until almost noon and the room was cleaned. She finally agreed to send up a maintenance man who was very pleasant and brought us clean towels and took out the trash. There is only one restaurant on the property.

The timeshare pitch is intense as usual, and we did not end up buying although it seems very compelling. It took the full 2 hours advertised plus another 15 minutes or so. We recommend having your own breakfast before you go, rather than trying to enjoy somewhat mediocre coffee and prewrapped bagels - go for the bananas and apples. They will slightly push you to book tickets for attractions before you leave, so be forewarned. They told us they sell to about 40% of the attendees and we can see why.

But within 5-10 minutes are the parks, restaurants, grocery, etc. We loved staying at this hotel and will definitely go back. We used our points to get two adjoining rooms since we had 3 kids with us. So the kids got a room with 2 double beds and a mini kitchen. Their room was then attached via door to the main kitchen and family room. Our master bedroom and bath was then off the other side of the family room. There was plenty of room for all.

At night we could see the fireworks from the parks and on New Years Eve the fireworks from all the parks were spectacular. The hotel has a main parking lot that you can park in is you would like. A larger SUV with a topper would park here. But the towers do have parking decks and large SUV's without toppers can fit in there. We drove a expedition and had no problem parking.

My wife loved the washer and dryer in the suite and I loved the fact they have 2 TVs. The only downer really is to get the suite cleaned every day, it seems as some people don't have service every day for their suites. So we had to call them a couple times to get it done, but it was never a problem. Best is to leave the staff a note on the door or table that they have to do it and that does the trick. Pool and Jacuzzis, great warm to hot, even so it was chilly during our stay in the air, we still went swimming every day. Everything was great and clean and great friendly staff. My daughter loved the play grounds they have. After a 2 trip to Tampa we came back and where now placed in the Tower 1. Which is the same but I recommend to get a suite in Tower2 if possible. We had one small issue here: the back of the couch was torn apart and the stuffing came out. If you placed the pillows nicely you couldn't see it, but of course once you went on it, it was there and our daughter started to pull on it. I asked somebody at the reception to take some action and I was promised things are taken care of. Unfortunately nothing happened anymore\u2026. Coming from the hotel industry myself, I can even understand that it was maybe not possible to fix it or replace it during the busy holiday season. BUT; somebody could have told us, said we are sorry, put some flowers or a fruit basked to the suite. But you gotta do something, especially if the customer tells you already in a friendly manner that there is an issue. After all Hilton Vacation Club Parc de Solei is not a 29$ Motel. Again we had the 1 time issue with the cleaning of the suite but we left the message and things worked fine and it was always nicely cleaned. We didn't go to the restaurant so we cant tell and we did the shopping outside at the publix. Also a need thing is, the Hotel has a 3 story park house. A important information for the European guest, I mention this here cause people have complained about it; YOU MUST HAVE A CAR! Car rental in Florida is cheap, but since you always have distances in America you need a car otherwise you will waste so much of the time. Remember just down the road means 30-60min walk, so better have a car and be free. You can still take the shuttle to the parks if you like.

Parking and internet were great (and free!). Everything was clean and staff was very nice. We stayed at the other Hilton Vacation club on International Drive last spring and that location was better (literally right next to an outlet mall and could walk to a grocery store and a handful of restaurants). But the pool at Parc Soleil was better in my opinion. They had a beautiful zero entry pool that was really long and there were tons of small children sitting and playing in the water. The setup was a little strange b/c along the zero entry part of the pool was all the tables and chairs for the restaurant instead of lounge chairs but we often parked ourselves at a restaurant table with our own snacks/drinks and no one seemed to mind. We didn't eat a meal at the restaurant but they have Blue Moon on tap which is a plus! They also had a nice gated area with slides and climbing equipment for the kids. The pool was heated but not overly warm - it was nice. Our room was modern and clean. Nice tv's and a dvd player. The only thing about the room design that I thought was bad is that the door between the bedroom and the living room (we had a 1 bedroom suite) was made of tinted glass of some sort and not full wood. So basically we would put our kids to bed in pack n' plays (which were provided immediately upon check-in, as well as high-chairs, which were functional but could've used a scrub down) and then watch tv but the bedroom was lit up from the living area. I went to bed early one night and it drove me a little crazy b/c I like to sleep in the pitch black. The doors look good but they are poorly designed. That's really my only room complaint. The balcony was awesome - the door was off the tracks when we checked in but it was fixed immediately. One piece of advice. We had a room in Tower 100 (there's only 100 and 200 now - more to be built) and were facing the pool. However our balcony was never in the sun so on early mornings when I was drinking my coffee (which bring your own - the stuff provided is pretty bad) I would be a little chilly. Also in the afternoons when the kids napped we wished our balcony was in the sun. So if I could do it all over again I'd request a balcony in building 200 facing the pool - they had sun all the time. The location was not near anything but it was really a quick drive to grab a pizza or groceries. So you definitely need a car.

Room- No upgrade available (ok no problem), but the room had no seating area, or balcony. The room was so noisy! We could hear our neighbours above us, and on either side, as well as loads of hallway noise. I never complain about noise, I'm a good sleeper, so it's never an issue for me, but this was a little over the top. Our mini broke down, and left a rotten smell in our room while we were out one day, ick! There wasn't anything in the fridge, but it was just that bad fridge smell, I called front desk, no apologies, the ended up putting the fridge in the middle of the bedroom, guess they were having outlet problem?? Which would be fine, but no one acknowledged the problem or said anything about it. Service- The service was awful!!! Any time we had a problem and reported it, it was so painful! Was it because they were busy? or was it because it was a Vacation Club Location?? I have no idea, but it wasn't pleasant. One day no one would call us a cab. When we asked for a cab they gave us a number to call, we didn't have our cell phones on us, so they said go back to your room to make the call.....I was a little ticked off at that point, what hotel doesn't get guests cabs when they need them?? Amenities- The hotels saving graces are it's amenities, with a fabulous pool area, and a decent restaurant and market on site. The pool has activity staff which was enjoyable, and all the kids on site seemed to be having fun. Location- It literally is close to nothing. There is nothing in walking distance. The plan is to expand, but right now it's a sad area. Although it was a quick cab ride to Disney/Shopping/Outlets/Universal. In all I wouldn't stay here again, but I think there is major room for improvement.

Overall, it was a nice, clean Hilton experience. The beds were wonderful, I loved the claw foot bath with the water pouring in from the ceiling. The shower was really big and had two shower heads which was really nice as well. At the pool they had fun activities for the kids when we were there, many nice spas and a waterfall that fell into the pool with a water slide. The marketplace was expensive (not unexpected), and a $7.99 bottle of wine at home was $17.00 there. The appliances were definitely low end. Our toaster broke and the washing machine belt broke as well. Our major concern was the timeliness of room service. Being on the 14th floor, we were pretty close to last and room service tended to show up at 4 - 5 pm, when we were back for a rest or dinner. Most days we declined Room service and just got coffee and towels, the first two days the room service forgot to leave coffee. I found out at the end that I could have asked for early room service, but I didn't know that. One other detracting thing was the location. This is a resort in progress, they plan on building several new towers so there wasn't much around. Also, don't go for the fireworks view, they are so far away, it's not worth it, so your view really is of a distant Orlando not much else. You can see Epcot in the far distance.

So glad I did! The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, with a cobblestone street leading to the gated entrance. The staff is wonderful and extremely friendly. There are two pools, the main one with a slide. There are also four hot tubs. It was a truly beautiful hotel. And what was best is that it's clean. I'd read so much about roaches at other hotels, so I was a bit nervous. But I didn't see a one! :-) It's a relatively new hotel, so that was even better. There is a small games room for the kids to enjoy themselves on the chillier nights or if they tire of the pool, complete with a PS3, ping pong and a pool table. For the younger ones, there is a playroom with a TV and toys. Now, I did have a couple of problems: no wake-up calls two days in a row and a fridge that didn't cool properly (milk curdled). However, the staff looked into both issues immediately and the hotel took care of me quite well, making amends for my inconveniences. I stayed in a studio room, which was quite sufficient for my daughter and I. And the bathroom was nice and big, with a huge shower! The hotel is off Palm Parkway, which is a bit off the beaten path, so you need a car to get around, but that also makes it nice and quiet.

We hired a car with GPS at the airport, however the hotel is not yet available on the system but thankfully we had our confirmation letter and were able to use a nearby address to find the hotel. The hotel is in the middle of no where but in a sprawling area such as Orlando and as it was recommended that we hire a car anyway, this did not pose any problem for us. Check in was very quick and the staff very pleasant. We weren't in our room ten mins when the phone rang asking about our interest in timeshares, however we knew to expect this from other reviews. We arranged to attend the timeshare breakfast the following morning as they were offering excellent discounts on park tickets. As it turned out we slept late and missed the breakfast, our rep, Joshua called and we told him we were not going to bother with it and didn't hear from him again after that, No constant pushiness as described in other reviews. Our studio room was just perfect for two, extremely roomy with a lovely large bathroom and small kitchenette. Our trip was originally set to last 9 nights but due to circumstances it had to be cut back to 7. As it was fully paid in advance we could get no refund on the last 2 nights and the same was in fact stimulated upon booking. As a treat and due to the fact our trip had to be cut short, we decided to upgrade our room to a one bedroom suite on our fourth day. This was at an extra cost of $33 dollars per night incl tax which we thought to be a pretty good deal especially after we saw the new room. Huge big living area with a large flat-screen, there is also a full kitchen including a washer and dryer, the bedroom was as big as the studio and had another flat-screen. The bathroom was very spacious with his and hers washbasins, a beautiful deep bath with separate shower area. In short, WOW and definitely the room I would recommend when booking your trip, it is worth every extra penny. We went from a pool view to a Lakeview and with binoculars (which we packed) a disneyworld/epcot view. The pool was wonderful and a much needed amenity after a day at the parks and is open until 11pm. The adult pool or reflection pool as it was called is an excellent idea, especially for those, like us, that like to relax without the boisterous excitement of disney happy children splashing about. The spa pools are a dream come through and I could have spent hours within it. The marketplace is very handy, however it is slightly expensive so we used the local walmart about two miles away. The cafe soleil is nice and we ate there on our last night only with the exception of a quick snack on another evening. service was a tad slow as the waitress is on her own and could definitely do with some help. The free car park underground is not as small as other reviews say, we were driving a large SUV and had not problem parking it at all, the spaces are more than adequate. Customer Service is not overly in-your-face,however anytime we asked for anything it was dealt with very efficiently and pleasantly. They leave you to your own devices and that suited us just fine. The room was spotless with housekeeping attended to daily.

We stayed in a one bedroom suite. It was very spacious and a bright space. It had a full kitchen (Oven, Hob and microwave) and a very large fridge. It also had a washing machine and dryer. I could have easily stayed there for 2 weeks, given the standard of accommodation on offer. In the lounge area there was a King sofa bed and flat screen TV, and the bedroom had a king bed with en-suite facilities (lovely big walk in shower and bath with fancy ceiling mounted faucets!). The toilet was accessible from the kitchen/living room and from on suite - which is handy. The location was easy enough to find - we just downloaded a map to the address from Google. Only thing is that the entrance is not that well sign posted until you are almost upon it - fortunately my husband executed a perfect handbrake turn before we drove past. :-) There is nothing within walking distance, but plenty of shops (Wal-Mart - about 5 mins away) and restaurants (several if you turn right at the hotel exit and drive for about 5 mins, also takes you to Downtown Disney Area) within driving distance.

We ate in the hotel poolside restaurant, whilst our daughter watched the Little Mermaid on the big cinema screen (at the Dive in). The food was reasonably good, the service was a bit hit and miss , that said it was perfectly enjoyable. It was pretty laid back, people still in swimming gear till 10PM, and had a really good vibe for families. I also noticed that they had a children\u2019s area, which would be good for children from 6 - teenagers, it had a WII, PS3, DVDs on with staff supervision - located close to the restaurant and bar and pool. Looked great for the older kids, who all seemed to be enjoying themselves. There is also a play park area for the little ones - really nice safe place to play. The pool area is fab. There were 2 swimming pools, an adult one and the main one for everyone. The main one also had an excellent slide. I think our money was wasted on Disney tickets - since my daughter would have been equally happy at the pool each day!!! To sum up, accommodation was very high standard (I should also say that our suite was cleaned each day and I thought the standard of housekeeping was good), on-site facilities (pool, shop, restaurant, entertainment) all excellent. Easy access to Disney parks. Only negative is that you cannot walk anywhere - area a bit isolated - but that was not an issue for us at all. We had a car (oh - should have mentioned the undercover parking which was great - as it kept car fairly cool!) and it was too hot to do much walking. Positives far outweigh negatives. I hope to be back (soon).", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worcester, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cUnbelievable.

I've never stayed at a property where each and every employee knew and practiced the best of customer service. Kudos to Parc Soleil for knowing how to recruit and hire the right people. Likewise, kudos to Parc Soleil for investing in quality, comfortable beds. Pool areas are very nice, with one restricted to adults only. I like that! Equipment in the fitness room is excellent. Now the negatives: Suite location directly impacts the quality of one's stay. Unfortunately, our suite location was poor. We had a view of........nothing but a vacant site cleared for soon-to-come construction. Moreover, our suite's balcony was directly over a mega-fan that vented the parking garage 24/7. The constant roar of the fan made it impossible to enjoy the balcony. The style of the suites is decidedly contemporary. It is generally attractive, except for the ridiculous sofa that looks more like a psychedelic coffin with sides so high it is impossible to access the side tables and fabric so coarse you don't want it touching bare skin. Besides being ugly, the sofa was completely uncomfortable. Likewise, the layout of the kitchen/dining area was somewhat odd. The door of the refrigerator could not be opened without banging into one of the dining chairs. I slid the whole dining set over to try to create more room. And - the toilet closet: OMG - the combined light/fan sounded like a jet engine.....not a very pleasant greeting when using the facility in the middle of the night. Housekeeping was also inconsistent - not its quality, but the timing of housekeeping's visit. Some days it was in the morning; other days as late as 5 PM. And...the final negative: As I expected, we received THE call our first morning there urging us to participate in a Vacation Club tour and presentation, and offering us everything from a free continental breakfast to \"gifts\" valued at $100. How I hate these pressure calls. You can't get the person to back off and when you say you are not interested, she just keeps upping the offer. Why can't these properties ask you when you make your online reservation if you are interested in a Vacation Club presentation? If the answer is no, then please LEAVE US ALONE. Would I return to Parc Soleil? The answer is a qualified \"yes.\" If I returned, I would request a suite location overlooking the pool area. I would also inquire about the status of construction. Five more buildings are planned. I would definitely not want to stay there once construction gets underway.", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Washington, New York", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel; Confusing Layout\u201d", "Author": "cepe1980", "ReviewID": "UR84107417", "Content": "This was a beautiful hotel, with fountains in front and a large warm wading pool and average sized swimming pools on the side.

One heads up - the pool slide isn't always open during regular hours if demand isn't there (as it wasn't with the cool weather).

The room was attractive - I liked the wood floors and there was also artwork on the walls. The bathroom was huge with plenty of square footage and a large glassed-in shower. When we had time, we relaxed at the spacious pools and spas. The waterslide was so much fun - more adults should try it! The only issue (and I don't think the hotel could do anything about it) was the 'lovebugs' that were swarming around the pool area. Apparently they migrate twice a year and we happened to be there for the late summer nuisance. Don't worry, they do not bite, they just land on the lounge chairs in large numbers. The concierge was very helpful. We asked about theme park tickets, but decided against it, since we wouldn't be able to spend much time at one. She recommended several restaurants in the area and gave us discount cards. We went to the Big Fin Seafood Kitchen in the Dellagio Town Center.

There's a massive kids pool with waterslide/falls, plus adult pool and all the rest of the stuff like a gym and .... any nice resort would have. It does not have a spa. You can watch fireworks from your balcony at two of the Disney parks (no sound). There's great food for nominal prices at the restaurants. Starbucks coffee. Pack-n-plays and high chairs? Just dial 0. One room's air conditioner wasn't working properly and there were issues with the keys not working over and over, but the manager comped the room AND gave my family member a future free night stay. This shows they REALLY want you to enjoy your stay. The other 3 rooms were soo fabulous. And the tub water coming out of ceiling, fun fun. Saturday night there was a giant screen by the pool and we watched the movie Marmaduke. The sound system is good as well as screen clarity. Some people watched movie from in pool, which looked really cool. We sat in the lounge chairs. You can get popcorn, snacks, soda too.

Do not book a studio suite!\u201d", "Author": "ILove2Travel95", "ReviewID": "UR80526549", "Content": "The Parc Soleil is conveniently located off of Palm Parkway in an area that is currently very quiet and peaceful. There is very little other development in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. However, it is just a couple of miles in one direction from the hotel to one of the entrances to Walt Disney World and Universal Studios is just 5-6 miles in the other direction, both very quick and easy drives. It is secluded, yet close to the action. The grounds are very well maintaned. The pool area is very large and enjoyable. There are 3 or 4 huge whirlpools as well as one very large main pool with water features and another smaller pool, both heated. The restaurant which overlooks the pool area is a relaxing place for a meal. The hotel seems like a great place for families. There seemed to be tons of kids activities going on, which is outlined in a booklet you receive at check-in. Be aware that the \"studio suite\" is not as glamorous as it sounds in Hilton's marketing. All of the studio rooms are actually connecting rooms, part of a larger suite designed to add a bedroom if needed for a guest in the larger suite. The studio really felt like an afterthought, and it was disappointing. All of the studios have hardwood (really vinyl or something else) flooring and no carpeting at all. There is no artwork in the studios either, and the window is small, not allowing for an expansive view. All combined, this makes the studio seem very cold and unappealing, in my opinion. In addition, you will hear an incredible amount of noise from the neighboring suite (through the connecting door). I would strongly suggest reserving the 1 bedroom suite, which is much nicer than the studio, and has a separate carpeted bedroom, as well as a spacious balcony and expansive living and dining area with a kitchen. For what you get (or really don't get) with the \"studio\", I feel there are plenty of other nicer, more comfortable and inviting rooms in Orlando for a similar price. The studio is basically an \"extra\" room, and it really feels that way. It's designed for those who reserve a 1 bedroom suite and need a 2nd bedroom. In this way, it's fine, for kids, or extra family members or friends, as an extra room with a bed and bath. The other perplexing thing was wondering why the parking garage was designed as it is. It's convenient to park and get to your room quickly, but beware the concrete pillars in the garage. It takes some extra concentration to park without hitting pillars or other cars.

We had been wanting to stay since it was finished because we have friends in Orlando and usually stay at the Hilton on International Drive - the Tuscany - which we love. I booked a 2 bedroom pentouse suite and it was simply gorgeous. The master suite bathroom was elegant and very chic. The spout for the bathtub is on the ceiling and so really cool. Only thing, there was nowhere to put your soap - no soap dish, only a ledge behind the tub to sit your toiletries on. The soap just stays in the tub with you. The other glitch was the TV/sound system. The tv is a nice flat-panel tv with a Yahama sound sytem and there's also a dvd player. There are 3 remotes but no instructions to tell you how to operate any of them. My friend and I had rented a movie and figured out how to operate the dvd but couldn't get the sound system to work. So we called the front desk and they sent a maintenance man up who arrived about 20 minutes later. He was very helpful and pleasant and we finally got to watch our tv. But you would think there would be some kind of instructions for these things - everybody is not a media wizard! The resort sits in a huge area where there isn't anything else around, which I liked.

I noticed he had at least twenty six questions to ask and realized we would never be released from this meeting. We told him to release us from this presentation.

The whole experience was embarassing and annoying. This was one of the problems. We booked a two bedroom suite and I was surprised to find they were two separate room. This was not what I expected. The second smaller room consistently had a strong odour of cleaning fluid throughout our stay. I was also dismayed to find that the activitites at the pool were loud and often geared toward young children. I wanted to rest and enjoy the sun. I didn't need to hear a trivia contest naming music from televisions shows I could care less about. I understand Orlando is for children but I would have liked this described to me in some way. This was not mentioned in hotel literature. If I had known this I would have returned to the International Drive location. I should also mention that this high pressure sales tactic was not at the other location. I have to say that I'm extremely disappointed with this experience. I was only at the location six days. I did not have a good rest and will not return. Our room was $195/night and I expect to be treated with more respect than having a cheap sales presentation shoved down my throat. I expect this sort of thing when I place my name in a box to win a car and accept the offer of a free night stay somewhere not from the Hilton where I'm supposed to be considered their \"bread and butter\".", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWOW Perfect with Kids\u201d", "Author": "fldavefan", "ReviewID": "UR77557509", "Content": "Wow what a great hotel..we have a 4 yr old and a 2 year old and this was perfect... the aterslide for the 4 year old and a walk in pool for the 2 year old..not to mention a closed off bed room when the kids go to bed you can still have your own time and sit out on the porch or in teh living room. we got the 1 bed room suite and it was plenty it was bacically a 1 bed room condo..location is great its only a mile ro so away from just about anything you need (reasturants,grocery stores,gas stations,disney) would deffinatly recomend for any one who likes new clean roomy hotel rooms.", "Date": "August 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Annapolis", "Title": "\u201cVery Attractive some functional issues/\u201d", "Author": "melnek", "ReviewID": "UR77533680", "Content": "FIrst of all, let me say we have stayed in other locations for the past 10 years and usually find them very enjoyable.

Positives: The 2 bedroom suite was well appointed and huge, I don't know of a better sized room. The kitchen facilities are excellent and the washer / dryer come in handy if you are on an extended stay. We only paid $195 per night + tax through Hiltons own site and I have to say that value for money is incredible. We had 4 nights in the Portofino Bay prior to this stay and paid more than double this rate for less than half the bedroom, albeit the Portofino has better restaurants etc. The parking and Internet are free too, on an extended stay these small items add up so credit to Hilton for the non-profiteering. I thought the parking was fine, the spaces are a bit tight but the elevators are right by the exit of the parking bays, we found the pool and the food was very good and again terrific value. We used the market place for last minute things but spent most of our money on a one-off trip to the supermarket to stock up on water/beer etc. As the room has a fully functioning kitchen we also bought breakfast items, this saved us time and expanding waist-lines. I've read a few people say it is out of the way - don't really understand that comment as I found the location to be ideal, it is almost equidistant to the Disney Parks and Universal Parks taking me around 15 minutes to anywhere. It is also only one mile to the Crossroads Retail Park which has countless restaurants, shopping and bars. The only way to get closer is to stay on property and pay a lot more, having stayed at The Grand Floridian a few times, it isn't worth the convenience when you get such an amazing room and great value at Parc Soliel. Negatives: when we arrived there was only one bellman on duty and he took an age to come empty our car, not a good first impression. We were ahead of the 16:00 check in time so didn't get our room, another small annoyance after a long journey, and when we asked for two rooms together with our friends we were only given rooms on the same floor but they weren't close at all. Housekeeping is VERY patchy, we left a gratuity every day but on the last day our beds were hardly made, nothing was cleaned and none of the bins emptied. We also has a sour waitress one of the nights (had a terrific waiter the previous meal) and she kinda made us feel uncomfortable, I did make a note on the check and a supervisor called to follow up. I asked for NO sales calls but still got two, I found being quite rude the second time worked rather well. Overall I found the staff to be very hit-or-miss, the management need to spend either more time training or more money hiring to improve the service, it does impact when you are on vacation if your room is a mess and the wait staff are impatient and unfriendly, however, these are all human issues which can be addressed.

Our room was a 1-bedroom studio in Tower 2 (newest Tower). The hotel staff was friendly in all cases. We had some confusion upon check-in. We had requested a pool-view room, but the font-desk staff told us that there were no pool-view rooms available. They told us they were able to provide a room with a view of the Disney fireworks. But upon entering our room, it was actually a pool-view room. Not a big deal to us, but still a little confusing. Overall the room was clean and adequate size for both of us. The bathroom was a little awkward in layout, but still served its purpose. We have no kids, but the hotel had a nice itinerary of activities for children throughout the day and into the evening. The hotel also provides a nice selection of DVD rentals (DVD players are in the rooms) for a fee of $3.00 (good selection of movies). We spent 3 days at the pool and 2 days at the parks. We thought that the pool was beautiful and we had no problems finding chairs or shade for the days we spent at the pool. The pool is only open until 11pm, which does not work well if you want to go swimming at night after returning from a park (as pool will be closed). There is only 1 restaurant at the hotel and also a market caf\u00e9 (which serves Starbucks coffee). We ate lunch at the restaurant twice and thought selection was good and food was great. We rented a car and had no issues with finding parking in the garage, especially upon arriving back at the hotel late at night. Our only complaint (as others have also posted) was that spots were narrow. We also were not happy with the housekeeping staff. Our room was not cleaned prior to 5:30 on each of the days we spent at the hotel (versus the parks). Cleaning staff was on the floor whole time, but never made it to our room (not sure if it is because we only had a studio and we were last on priority list). Each time we had to tell them not to clean as we wanted to get ready for the evening but needed them to do a quick change in towels at that point. We mentioned to a staff member on last day and were told that we need to request early cleaning. That was a new experience for us\u2026 We were asked to attend the sales presentation for the Hilton Grand Vacations Club. It actually was not as bad as I had expected. We did not feel pressured and the hotel provided us with free breakfast (muffins, bagels, fruit coffee, etc). Selection of incentives was nice as we chose the $100 AMEX gift card. Out presentation lasted 45 minutes as we said we were not interested up front (I have read reviews in which other presentations lasted longer and felt more pressured). Overall, we had a good experience that met our expectations (relaxing stay, clean room, friendly staff, and great pool area). We would recommend this hotel for the value received for the price paid. Also location is great to parks, restaurants, outlets, etc. But we did not feel that the Parc Soleil offered us anything above and beyond.

We had a little bit of trouble find the hotel. ARRIVAL: Because the roads in the area are new, the hotel provides an alternate address to use for GPS directions. My GPS thought the location was about 1.5 miles away from the actual hotel and had us going in the wrong direction. I would recommend switching to the hotels written directions once you are in the general area. We arrived at about 3:50 pm. There was nobody else checking in and it was fast and efficient. We were given a room in building 200 on the 12th floor with views of the Disney fireworks. You can see the fireworks but they are quite a distance away. ROOM: We had a one-bedroom suite, which was very large and had a full kitchen with full size appliances. There is also a washer/dryer in the unit, which had 2 packets of laundry detergent available. The sofa bed was not a standard, wire spring based unit. The sofa bed was made up of 3 thick foam sections that formed the mattress and was very comfortable. There are LCD televisions in the living room and bedroom. There was a wide selection of channels, but no PPV. The doors separating the bedroom were frosted French doors. They seemed to prevent sound transmission, but light from the living area did make the bedroom lighter if someone was trying to sleep while others had lights on in the living area. There was a large balcony with table, chairs and one padded lounge chair. There was a safe in the bedroom closet. There was a clock/radio in the bedroom that had an IPOD connection on the top. I was able to dock my iphone, to play music and also to charge it. The bathroom was large with double sinks, separate large shower and tub. The tub was cool, because the water filled from a hole in the ceiling. The toilet was in a little separate area with a pocket door to separate it from the rest of the bathroom. The bathroom could be accessed from both the living area and the bedroom. The toiletries were Crabtree & Evelyn brand. FOOD: We ate in the restaurant once for dinner. The good was good and not too expensive. There is a little market shop on property where they sell coffee, sandwiches, and have a small grocery selection. PARKING: The parking spots were on the smaller side, and there were a lot of columns etc that caused spaces to feel tight, but I didn\u2019t have any problems maneuvering or parking our rental car (Chevy Impala). OTHER: The pool area is great. They have a zero entry pool with a water slide. The slide is a very good size for a hotel pool. It is longer than expected. They also have a children\u2019s play area and an activity center. The activity center has a pool table, ping pong, WII, Playstation 3, board games etc. They also have activities throughout the day, and provide a brochure with all the times. We were asked a few times about joining a timeshare presentation. I think they should just ask once and then that is it. Also, once they called after 9pm when my kid was already asleep, luckily it didn\u2019t wake him up. There are gym style lockers and changing areas in the restrooms by the pool.

My girlfriend and I booked Parc Soleil for our week's vacation to Orlando based on the many positive reviews on Tripadvisor.com, and we also wanted to avoid the crowds at the Disney Resorts. I am sorry to say we made a huge mistake. The \"hotel\" was great, but the little nuisances kept adding up. My first issue with this place happened BEFORE I checked in. The Monday before our arrival I was contacted by someone trying to sell me a time share. She offered me Sea World park tickets or 20,000 Hilton points if I sat and listened to their sales pitch over a 90 minute breakfast. I politely declined, but she wouldn't give up. I finally told her that I was unavailable and hung up the phone. You would think that would be the end but it wasn't. Someone from sales called me at least 6 more times prior to my arrival, but I let the calls go right to voicemail. We drove to the Hilton, and was greeted by a friendly bellhop who took our luggage. I was under the impression that he was also going to valet my car, but he did not. We were told to park in the horrible parking garage (I'll address that later). The bellhop brought our luggage to our room and gave us a tour of our room and answered all of our questions. The positives: We opted for the 1 bedroom suite with balcony. The room was very spacious with a modern kitchen. The balcony was also large and was equipped with a table with 4 chairs and a lounge chair. The room was very clean, and housekeeping did a great job maintaining the cleanliness of the room. The complex has 2 very clean pools and plenty of chairs. The negatives: 6 things really stood out. First, the parking garage is terrible. The parking garage in building 200 is built right behind the restaurant, so all the exhaust from the restaurant goes right into the garage. The last night of our stay my girlfriend and I could barely breath walking through the garage. The spaces are also very tight. Because the spaces are so tight, people often hog two spaces so their cars don't get hit. I don't blame them for doing this, but it is still inconsiderate to the other guests. We elected to park outside the garage, but if you do be prepared to breath in the restaurant fumes. Second, the air conditioner. We had to keep our room temperature at 65 degrees. If we went above 65 the heater for some reason would kick on and the room would go to 85 degrees. We had to call maintenance twice about this issue, but we elected to just keep the room freezing. Third, garbage in the hallways. My room was very clean, however, for some reason housekeeping or other occupants left trash out in the hallway. Some of the trash smelled terrible and I feel this could be a health issue. Forth, sales will call you to get you to sit for the timeshare demonstration. I guess since I did not schedule to sit for the sales presentation, sales felt the need to keep nagging me during my trip. The do not like taking no for an answer. Fifth, contrary to other reviews and other internet sites, THE SECOND POOL IS NOT ADULTS ONLY. Our main reason for choosing the Parc Soleil was we read that they had an adults only pool as well as a main pool with a slide. The second pool is much smaller and quieter. We elected to go to that pool, however within minutes children were jumping and splashing everywhere. I even heard a parent say to his 2 children \"come on, let's go make noise at the quiet pool.\" I guess this happens because management has no control of the grounds. Children are running around all over the pool areas, but no one says anything to them or their parents. Sixth, the beds are extremely uncomfortable. I have problems sleeping as it is, so it was almost impossible for me to sleep. The mattresses are way too soft and you sink into the mattress. We both woke up sore every morning. I wish I had better things to say about Parc Soleil. The grounds are really pretty, but there are way too many things that I could not over look. My guess is that the majority of the positive reviews are from Hilton Vacation Club members that do not want to say anything bad about the place, or are just in denial about these small but significant negative details that could potentially ruin your vacation. I also feel management needs to take an active role in controlling the parking and pool situation. My advice, and I hate to say this, but is to stay at a Disney Resort.

Each night, we could see the firework shows at Epcot and Magic Kingdom from our window. The rooms were nicely decorated and clean. We had a problem with our refrigerator not cooling and a replacement was provided without issue. And wood floors are a plus in my book! We were pleasantly surprised to have a laundry room just a few doors down from our studio room that we could wash and dry our laundry (no charge). Most of our trip, we spent at the \"quiet\" pool. But we did venture down the waterslide a few times which was a blast. The hotel has planned activities throughout the day for kids and adults. We enjoyed the ice cream social! It was also very nice to have a convenience store / deli shop on site. Prices were not that bad for the convenience. And the sandwiches were very yummy made from there! The Parc Soleil appeared to be located on a new stretch of road that is developing. For us, being away from the congestion near Disney was nice. But having the ability to drive 5-10 minutes to attactions was a plus. Many restaurants were also close by. We had GPS to help and it worked satisfactorily with getting us there.

For a young couple this hotel is fantastic. The grounds are classy and well kept and the suite room (more like a small appartment) is mind blowing. To get a suite of this size and standard in a city like New York or London would cost mega bucks. Staff friendly and helpfull. The Hilton Parc Soliel makes Disneys accommodation look overpriced and I believe some of there hotels are getting a little tired (I have never stayed at one myself). I have also stayed at the Hyatt Grand Cypress and praised it at the time but this betters it in most places. Lots of families with young kids here but this did not detract from the overall experience for a young couple. The maid always offered us extra everything (dishwasher/washing powder). The grounds and communal areas are so expansive that it never feels very busy giving it a relaxing atmosphere. The parking is undercover so the car is nice and cool (relatively speaking) when you get in it. Be warned you will recieve a phone call regarding time share opportunities with a genuine and generous incentive if you take them up on the offer of a hotel tour, we did not (we`re on holiday for goodness sake).

Our first stay was for one night prior to an Animal Kingdom Lodge stay. We were so pleased with the hotel we decided to stay here during our next visit. This visit was 5 nights long and we reserved a two bedroom suite. The hotel is only a year old so everything is still new and shiny. The beds are all kings which we love. They are comfortable, too. The restaurant has excellent food that we felt was relatively reasonable. Most sandwiches were around $9 and included excellent sides, including caesar and regular salad. They had soup for $6. Kids' meals were $6, too. The activity center is new and wonderful - ping pong, pool table, tons of computers to use, board games, wii, etc. the pool is great for kids. the huge water slide is a blast. it is a zero entry pool so little guys have lots of safe room to play. While at Disney my kids (ages 6 and 4) kept asking to go back to the hotel they liked it so much. the kitchen is well stocked. we ate several meals at the hotel and had all the cooking supplies we needed. you may want to bring some paper plates, though, if you have more than 4 in your party and reserve only a one bedroom because they only provide 4 of everything. The hotel is fairly close to Disney - 5 minutes to epcot. it is about 1-2 miles from downtown disney. In sum, having LOTS of space in the suite, king bed, and wonderful hotel amenities easily made up for having to drive and park at the attractions! I would suggest renting a one bedroom over a studio if at all possible as the studios are a little cramped and don't have a full kitchen. they are more like a traditional hotel room. I know this because the studio is the second bedroom/bath in the 2 bedroom/2 bath suite. It's GREAT as a second bedroom, but not as a stand alone.

At USD129.00+ tax per day for a one brm suite, it was a wonderful deal compared to Disney's resort hotels. 2. The room with a king size bed and the living area with a sofa bed are spacious with a flat screen TV in each room. 3. The one bathroom has a tub, glass shower room, and a separate toilet room. The basin counter is spacious with 2 sinks on a granite top. 4. The beds are comfortable with enough pillows. 5. The well equipped kitchen area has a big fridge with good size freezer compartment, toaster, dishwasher, oven, micro wave oven, cutlery, glasses, plates, kettle, etc, for warming and preparing simple meals if a family does not wish to go out for a meal after a tired day. 6. It also has a washer and dryer in the room which is wonderful for time saving and convenience esp after a long tired day out. 7. It has a big swimming pool with a nice decent size slide for kids. 8. The staff are helpful and friendly. I guess they are making an effort to promote their relatively new hotel and vacation club plans. 9. The grounds are safe and big with 2 blocks of hotel currently. The Bad: 1. It is not easy to locate this hotel, even on our Garmin GPS with its Des Forges address although it is about 10 minutes drive away from the Disney Parks. 2. There are times when we were so tired after a long tiring hot day that we wondered if we should have just booked a Disney resort hotel because it is just a hop on a bus/boat/train away, instead of having to hop on Park bus to reach our car and then to drive back to our hotel. 3. It is not within short walking distance of any shop or restaurants. It looks like it is in the middle of a big expanse of land on its own with room to build a few more blocks of vacation homes. 4. Housekeeping needs to be called to clean your room in the morning or they might be real late in cleaning up your room like 5pm. Overall, the good far outweigh the bad.

The hotel is located in an still unoccupied area, but is very close to the parks (15 minutes) and very silent. The buildings (only 2 for the moment) are very nice, new and clean, and the pools seem excellent, although we didn't have time to enjoy them. We had the 1 bedroom suite for US$ 159/day in building A, and it was simply the best hotel room we have ever had. Modern, clean, spacious, with everything you need to feel at home: full spotless kitchen with flatware and all the necessary appliances, laundry washer/dryer (detergent included), 2 flat TVs, a king-size sofabed, a beautiful balcony with table and chairs and a lounge chair, and an enourmous bathroom with separate WC, separate shower, and a wonderful bathtub. Only the closet is a little small for such a huge suite. Front desk was very professional and helpful; we asked for a quiet room and they put us far from the main pool, which has music and entertainment for the kids. We had housekeeping every day of our stay. No problems with air conditioning, but I should say that we used to turn it off from time to time and open the balcony doors, since we like fresh air. High speed Internet and parking are free. The only minor inconvenience were the two calls from the time-sharing sales personnel, inviting us to a free breakfast. They were very polite, though, and we just said no, thanks. Very easy express check-out: they leave a statement of charges in the room, you dial a number, informing your name and unit number. You leave the keys in the room and off you go! We are looking forward to go back to Orlando and the Parc Soleil.

I wanted a well priced hotel with a large room, nice pool and located in the middle of all entertainment parks and for me the Parc Soleil by Hilton Grand Vacations Club seemed the perfect choice. This was our first time in Orlando and we were really excited. We arrived quite late in Orlando, around 10pm, got our rental car and drove directly to the hotel. The hotel is located in a quite area, because there isn't really much around the hotel, except the road. No chance going out for a walk just to get something for breakfast or something like that, except you like walking around 30-40 mins one way. If staying there I would really recommend a rental car, because you're just more flexibel and there is so much to discover in Orlando and with a car you can really take out all of every day. The hotel also offers free parking with much space in the parking block. The check-in went very quickly, only around 3 mins. We booked a studio suite, with a large kitchenette, seperate living area with flat TV, huge bath room, very comfortable bed room with one more flat TV and a huge balcony with a nice view. The suite was just amazing, just like the price. One thing I've got to criticize is the housekeeping, which could have been much better, like many other users here on TripAdvisor mentioned before. They sometimes completely forgot cleaning up the floor or replacing the soap and detergent. Well, and there was the strange construction of the shower, which sprayed the water on the bath room floor, even when there was the curtain. As I already mentioned the hotel is just in the middle of nowhere but also in the middle of everywhere. Sounds strange, but if you want to go out for a walk, there is hardly a chance reaching something useful like a Walmart or Starbucks. But if you got a car, you can reach everything within some minutes. Seaworld or Discovery Cove are only like 5 mins away, just like the next Walmart also just 5 mins, or Disney World about 15-20 mins. We had a great time at the Parc Soleil by Hilton Grand Vacations Club and I would recommend this hotel to everyone, who looks for a well-priced, modern and new hotel, plus free WiFi and free parking.

I was pleasantly surprised that housekeeping came every day and emptied the trash, made the beds, and new towels set out. I was pleasantly surprised that they did the dishes in the sink. My room was always clean when I returned at the end of the day. My room was beautiful and it had a very fancy dvd/tv/stereo system in the livingroom.

We go every May to Disney for 7-10 days. We don't stay on-property because it is too expensive for what you get and prefer a little more variety in food. We've stayed at various Marriott resort/vacation properties, Renaissance at Sea World, Hyatt Grand Cypress and multiple other time-share properties. We've decided that Parc Soleil is the best place so far! Our experience: We stayed at the Parc from May 12 - 19. We purposely chose mid-May since there are fewer tourists and it is considered off-season. I reserved the room 4 weeks in advance and talked directly with Hilton reservations which gave me a $125 \"Managers Special\" instead of the $159 rate initially offered. We were able to check in by 2 PM, and into a 1-bedroom suite of our choosing (new building, high floor overlooking Disney fireworks). Parking was tight, but there were plenty of open spaces - I was just happy for covered parking! Luggage carts were available in the parking garage - I turned down the luggage bellhop's help. We were stunned at how nice the room actually was. It was clean, and everything (appliances, TVs, furniture, materials) was top notch. My kids slept on the king-size pull out sofa which as quite comfortable. We made breakfast in the kitchen every morning, and even ate supper there a few times. We used the washer/dryer several times as well. Complaints on the loudness of the Air Conditioning are well-founded, however it never really bothered us. We occasionally heard the people next door, but it wasn't that bad. Although the view was what we requested, it did look out over the future building sites of other Hilton buildings, which was not very nice, but we never really spent that much time sitting on the balcony - which is HUGE. We did watch the fireworks one night, which were about 5 miles away. Beds are comfortable, bathroom is huge with a lock-off toilet room, and the shower has good water flow. Watch out for the toilet - it might suck you in when you flush! TV has alot of channels, but no movie rental options - you have to physically rent a DVD in the family center which costs $3 - small selection but they have a few new titles. You can also check out board games, play pool, and other kid-friendly activities there, which is right off of the main pool area. Free internet was nice, and the exercise room is better than many hotels I've stayed - and I travel for work. The pool is awesome! We've stayed at the Hyatt Grand Cypress several times and although it is bigger there, the Parc has a much bigger waterslide, zero entry area, and is conveniently located next to the restaurant so food/beverages are easier to get. For supper one time we called the kids out of the pool - they ate - then jumped right back in to play some more. Pool hours are long (8 AM to 11 PM). Overall, I prefer this property to the Hyatt Grand Cypress and the other Marriott 5 star resorts we've stayed at for the following reasons: 1) Its easy to get somewhere without having to walk a mile - the proximity of the pool to our room to the restaurant and everything else is very close and well thought out. 2) We prefer value luxury - we like staying at the very nice places but don't like being nicked-and-dimed for the extra stuff like bellhop/luggage, exercise room, internet, resort beverage (pool bar) only rules, towel service, etc that alot of the more expensive places tack on (most make you pay a daily \"resort fee\" that covers this stuff). If you want to be 'serviced' as if you are staying at a 6 star spa resort, then I suggest you go somewhere else. However, this place has good amenities that bridge the gap. Convenience store featuring Starbucks surpassed my expectations. They were pricier on foodstuff, but by the time you jump in your car and drive to the rip-off tourist grocery store it isn't that bad if you are buying a little detergent or ice cream. Starbucks coffee varies depending on who is mixing the drink. Deli is good for a quick bite. And they sell bathing suits if you forget yours. Wine is way overpriced. Restaurant is not a 4 star food place, but suffices to fill your stomach without ripping apart your wallet. Enough variety to eat there several times. The problem waitress referred to in other reviews seems to be gone. We liked eating poolside while watching the kids play. Overall, it was the little things that captured our attention: while relaxing by the pool, security makes its rounds about every 10-15 minutes, and we noticed they inquired about several very young children seemingly playing by themselves, making sure their parents were nearby. Staff came through regularly to clean up towels, straighten chairs, and check to see if we needed anything. They even came by and cleaned up bird poop off of a planter nearby. We received only one phone call within 15 minutes of checking in to attend a time-share presentation, which I turned down. The $100 gift card or discounted tickets were not enough to entice me to sit through the 1 hour presentation. There is a $25 late check out fee during busy times, but we were able to stay until noon without the fee by calling the morning of and requesting late check out. The only complaints I have are with housekeeping - we had to ask twice for towels and once for new bedsheets for the sofa bed. There was one day our room wasn't cleaned until after 5 PM. Cleaning was inconsistent, and sometimes the soap and detergent were not replaced when used. Also, the cleaning staff (not restaurant, store, or desk staff) were a little rude when we encountered them in the elevator area or garage. With my family of four when using the elevator or going to our cars, several times we had to stop and let the staff enter the elevator first or drive their golf carts down the ramp when it should be the other way around since we were guests. It was a good stay and we left here to go to the Hyatt Grand Cypress for 4 days. We were so disappointed staying there after the Parc, even though we'd stayed there before and they had undergone a multi-million dollar renovation. We will stay there again assuming the prices don't double.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dalton,GA", "Title": "\u201cGood Resort But BEWARE OF TIMESHARE SALES TOURS!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "lear192", "ReviewID": "UR65122314", "Content": "Make sure you know this is a Timeshare property for Hilton and you will not get daily housekeeping.

So I reserved a timeshare tour at 8am the last day at this resort before I went to another property. I arrived at 4pm and went inside since I saw no bellman around. Check in was fine and there was popcorn and coloring books in the lobby for the kids. After checking in I unloaded all my luggage myself since I still could not get help from a bellman. I went and parked my truck In the outdoor parking since my truck would not fit in the parking garage. I returned and still no bellman. We waited for a total of 15 min to get a bellman to get our bags. We arrived at our room which was a 1 bedroom suite on the 8th floor. The kitchen is very nice with Granite counters and stainless appliances. The living room is of nice size with a pullout KING size bed. The bedroom has a large King size bed and both rooms having flat panel tv\"s on the wall. The bathroom was HUGE and has a tub that is free standing that is filled from the ceiling.

The pool side food is good. On the last day I had my timeshare tour at 8am. WE RECEIVED A CALL IN OUR ROOM AT 7:30 MAKING SURE WE WERE GOING TO BE ON TIME AND ATTENDING OUR TOUR!!!!!! This was fine since we were almost ready and the sales center was beside the lobby. ME AND MY PREGNANT WIFE WITH TWINS (because you have to bring your spouse). We checked in at the front desk at 8am. We were told someone would be with us in a min. We continued to wait but as everyone else who arrived were whisked away on a tour we were left waiting After 20 min we decided we could not wait any longer since my wife was pregnant and we already had waited almost 1/3 of the time of the tour. I informed the front desk we were not going to wait and their was no expiation or we are sorry for the inconvenience just OK. I was not happy with this experience so I called the Hilton Vacation Club Sales line and spoke to a manager and he explained he could not help me I had to contact the resort sales center direct and speak with a manager on duty. He did tell me that they probably over booked. Apparently they give priority to guests that are solicited deals to come to the resort and take a mandatory tour or they have to pay full price. I guess I was not very important since I paid full price to stay at the resort and my time was wasted. I left a message for the manager on duty at the sales center at the resort but I have still to date not received a call. The main thing is the resort is supper nice but the bell service needs help.

The rooms were beautiful and the king size beds were great. The view overlooking the pool was amazing. We loved the huge balcony. My kids loved the pool and the waterslide. We ended up eating 4 dinners at the pool because my kids were so happy there. The food at the pool restaurant was very good and I felt it was reasonably priced. We went to the local grocery store and bought snacks and beverages which we were able to bring to the pool which saved a lot of money. The pool was busy at times but never overcrowded. You could always find tables and chairs. I loved having the washer and dryer in the room and did wash daily. It was so nice to come home with clean clothes. They provided detergent which was also great. I do agree that housekeeping could be improved. We were there 8 nights and our room was only cleaned once after the fourth night. They did not come into our room at all on the other days so our beds were never made. There was a place to take your trash so we took out our own trash daily. They did not restock our coffee or detergent but one call to guest services and it was sent up immediately. The staff was friendly and my kids loved the workers at the pool. All the slide attendants knew my children's names. We loved the movie nights by the pool and the game room was great. My kids went down the slide a few hundred times. The hotel is surrounded by vacant properties but the Hilton property itself is nice. We were only a few minutes from restaurants, Walmart and grocery stores. While you couldn't walk anywhere, you could drive there quickly. Disney was about 15 minutes. The concierge had great dinner recommendations and great coupons. Our room did not have any noisy AC - thank goodness. Parking in tower one had very narrow spots but the garage was never full so you could park further away if you wanted to protect your car. The elevator came quickly even to the 15th floor. Besides improving the housecleaning, I really don't have any complaints. My kids thought this was the best hotel EVER which made it great for us as parents. We were at the parks a lot during the day so missed a lot of activities at the pool, but they seemed to have a lot of them. If we hadn't already bought park tickets, my kids would have been just as happy staying at the hotel.

The pool and hot tub are sparkling clean. The rooms are spacious and nicely decorated. The fold out sofa is actually comfortable. The location in my opinion is perfect. You are minutes away from a ton of restaurants and just minutes to downtown disney and disney attractions. We enjoyed Carrabas, Olive Garden & TRex. I did not find any issue with service. We had an \"accident\" over night with my 4 year old son and the staff promptly brought us new sheets and a replacement cover for the bed with a change of sheets for the fold out. The pool is a 10. The pictures do not do it justice. In fact, it was one of the rare times that I actually enjoyed myself at a pool with my children instead of being worried the whole time about them drowning. The zero entry is the BEST. I did not know what that was but basically like a lake, with a very gradual increase in the depth. The water sprays everywhere are GREAT fun for the kids and the most amazing waterslide. I enjoyed it just as much as my children. The playground is wonderful, covered with a light tent so a nice place for the kids to get out of the sun. The hotel description does not do the Hilton Justice. It does not explain that there is a lovely pond on site that has a fabulous walking path around it that is lit up at night.

Also, we could see the fireworks of disney and epcot, along with the beautiful pool that has a fountain that changes colors... absolutely beautiful!

This was a leisure visit with a couple days at the theme parks, some shopping, and a couple days of pool time. This property has a lot of positives. Prices are very reasonable, it's nearly brand new, nice decor, two very nice pools, can get an Epcot fireworks view, not a long drive to various attractions. I thought the bathroom was one of the nicest I've seen. Large stand alone tub (very cool how water comes from ceiling!), huge shower with oversize shower head and hand held option. Unit is really spacious and easily comfortable for a longer stay. Decent soundproofing, but I could occasionally hear people next door and above. Balcony was also large and had a nice lounger as well as table and chairs. Not screened, but I didn't notice an issue with bugs (on 10th floor). I really liked having the option of using the main larger pool which includes water features and daily entertainment (livelier on weekends, but some entertainment every day) and is close to bar/restaurant. Smaller, adult pool is adjacent and much quieter, but still nicer than the basic rectangle you see sometimes. Ample towels were provided and I never saw more than half the chairs full although one of the staff commented that they were at 92% occupancy during my stay. I didn't find parking to be a problem in my small SUV. Spaces were kind of tight, but not ridiculously so and garage never seemed more than 50 - 75% full so you always had the option of parking further away if you didn't want to be next to another car. Now, onto the issues. In Building Two, the elevators are at the far end of one looooooong hallway and I ended up in the very furthest unit. I guess this is just the equivalent of being assigned a more distant building in a low rise property, but this long hallway walk made it feel like sort of a hike anytime you were going to the elevator to head to the pool or parking garage. Also, given the newness of the property, I was really surprised how dirty and spotted the hallway carpet was. Makes me wonder how well they will keep up the property. I definitely had issues with housekeeping as others have mentioned. Upon check in, found the wood furniture in the room very dusty. Also, on two different days when I had left the room by 9AM I returned after 5PM and found it had not been cleaned and had to call to get fresh towels. As others have said daily housekeeping really only includes taking out the trash, making the bed and replacing the towels. Bathroom and floors were not cleaned during my stay and I don't believe the sheets were ever changed and there was no card to request this. On another day when we returned from Epcot after 10:00, there were two unpleasant suprises. First, the air conditioning was not working and I had a voice mail from the front desk that something had gone wrong with swiping my credit card and I needed to come down that day (to front desk in the other building) to get if fixed. Well, it took two calls and an hour and a half for them to come fix the air conditioning (it was very hot!) and I ended up at the front desk around midnight to find out there had been some error on their end and there was no problem with my credit card. Also had to have two separate service calls on a severely leaking shower head which they said they fixed the first time and didn't. The last thing I didn't really care for was the property's location. If you're not familiar with the back roads you will definitely think you're way off the beaten track. Definitely cannot walk anywhere from here. Usually you'd think an advantage of being slightly out of the way would be serenity and views, but views are really of a future construction site and not at all appealing. Although it wasn't a long drive to attractions, I still would have prefered to be in either a more populated area, or if out of the way a prettier, more natural area.

I never - and I mean never ! !! expected a suite hotel to be this good .

Literally- the size of many New York apartments ! ( I am talking about the bathroom)- the suite is larger than many homes.. parking is free, and there is a shopping center 2 blocks away with a Wynne Dixie grocery story and ABC ( liquour ) store , among other things.In half an hour, I was stocked up with everthing I would ever need for meals. There are 2 pools- one shows movies for kids at night - fountains - outside bar- gorgeous- 4 hot tubs other is facing Disney- 1 hot tub, pool, fountain and lake with jogging path around it. Great little store - carries everything. Word of warning : They are building more hotels around the lake front- be sure to ask about this ! ( My husband and I never went to the theme parks after all- we did off beat stuff- but we returned every night to our luxury apartment and had dinner on the balcony, and fireworks for desert ).. Absolutely perfect ! If you want a quiet room-ask for the fireworks side. (Although I must admit that the soundproofing was supurb.)

If you'd like to stay someplace nicer, you have to shell out $200 or more per night, not even including taxes. At $145 per night for a brand new property - the Par Soleil fills the void for a new, good value hotel in the Orlando Area. Locationwise, this hotel is an easy 15-20 min drive from Disney Magic Kingdom; the address they have on their website does not pop up neither in mapquest, nor in my GPS, you can search alternatively for 7903 Palm Parkway. Check-in is at 4pm, which is kind of late I think, but it didn't affect us since we came in even later, check out is at 10am; at my request, they let us stay until 12pm, which scores a brownie point with me. The property is lovely - there are two buildings - One (where the reception is) and Two (opened just a couple of months ago), covered parking (free of charge) with plenty of spots available. There are two pools (the large one has a water slide and zero depth entry point) and two or three hot-tubs, which were large enough to accomodate at least 15 people without any problem. Although there were a lot of people vacationing at the hotel at the time, it never felt really crowded and loungers were always readily available. The pool water was perfect temperature, my compliments to hotel management for not trying to save on this like other hotels do. The hotel has a restaurant with inside and outside seating poolside. The food is good, averagely priced (apps/salads/sandwiches about 8-10$, main courses - high 'teens'), but the service is rather slow and some of the waiters (one waitress to be more specific) could care less about serving you with promptness. The hotel also has a child play area (playground with slides etc. outside) and a great looking montessori-like play room for younger children. I am not sure if they offer child-care services, maybe worth inquiring. We stayed in a studio, which is essentially a regular hotel room and it doesn't have a balcony. The bathroom has only a shower, but is a decent size. There is also a kitchennete area with a mini-fridge, microwave, sink, some silverware, paper towels etc. Baby cots can be provided on request free of charge; we were never provided with bedding for the cot though, even though we asked twice. Wireless internet is no-hassle (just find the network and connect without any passwords or special set ups) and is free; the business center (printing and faxing) is costly - internet usage goes for 25c per minute, 75c per page printed, but I guess for incidental needs is not that expensive.

Unfortunately we should have done more homework. We booked a king studio room based on the hotels photo and thought the size would be adequate for our needs. We also noted the balconies on the building and assumed that all rooms would have these. We were wrong on both of these assumptions. The room itself was clean and relatively new although the furniture is already showing signs of wear. We were really disappointed to discover that we did not have a balcony or even a window that would open. Our view was a construction site. The air conditioner fan was really noisy and we could not sleep with it on and as the weather was really nice it would have been nice to be able to open a window. Temperature control is a challenge in this room. It is warm and stuffy without the airconditioner or the cold air blows directly at the bed if you have it on. The kitchen in this room was a joke. The refridgerator was far too small for even two people. We had hoped to bring in food for breakfast and some snacks but the fridge held very little and did not keep the food adequately cold. There are two sets of dishes in the room. Early in the week we accidentally broke a glass and let the staff know but it was never replaced. Dish towels were taken by cleaning staff and we had to write a note to have them replaced too. The pool area is very attractive and probably the reason for the positive reviews. I think this hotel would be a very good choice for a family with young children as there are many activities for this age group. There were many many youngsters there during our visit and the took over the pool area and the hot tub. They appeared to greatly enjoy the water slide. I was concerned that the staff did not attempt to control the children at all (and most parents were not watching them either) as they ran all over the deck, leaping into the pool or the hot tubs. Very small children (looked about two) were allowed to go down the full sized water slide which would normally have a height restriction. I think this is an accident waiting to happen. We found the rooms to be extremely noisy because of very thin walls. You will hear the people in the rooms beside you and because of the wooden floors you will hear every step the people take in the room above you. We did get an excellent rate because we paid for the trip in advance so we could not go and find another hotel. We did express our frustrations to the staff but they were very young and did not attempt to help us. A suite was not available. When our rooms was not cleaned by 7pm on the first day they did promise to do a better job the rest of the week and this was done. The concierge staff are really time share staff and not very helpful. The young man helping us could not understand why we would not be interested in listening to a presentation for hours to save $100 on a Disney pass.

We reserved a 2 bedroom suite which included a sofabed in the living room area to accomodate the 6 of us. PROS: We got a lot of space for the price. Our \"suite\" was about 1300 square feet. Kitchen was stocked with enough dishes for us to buy a few groceries and save a little money not eating at the resort restaurant or buying anything in the Marketplace store. Great location. It is not in a busy area but is within 5-15 minutes of SeaWorld, Disney, and Universal. The large balcony was awesome. We could put the kids to bed and hang out playing cards on the balcony at night. CONS: Pool was much smaller than we expected and their \"interactive water fun\" other than one waterslide was waterfalls and a couple of sprinklers. This was disappointing because one of our main reasons for chosing this resort was for our kids to enjoy the pool. A/C was REALLY loud. I had read reviews noting the A/C volume before we went but just passed it off as people being persnickity - it is not. It is very difficult to carry on a conversation in the kitchen when the A/C is on because it is so loud. Parking Garage is super tight! I received several door dings to my minivan this week and it was very difficult to pull in and out of these narrow spots. One would think that Hilton would be expecting SUV's and minivans at this type of resort. 2 Bedroom Suite? OK, maybe I'm just being picky, but what was marketed as a 2 bedroom suite is really a 1 bedroom suite with connecting doors to a regular single bed room. This still gave us plenty of space, but it wasn't laid out in the same way as a cohesive unit would have been. The main problem was the bathrooms situation - the \"master bath\" was open to the main room to be used as the common bathroom. View? There is a lake with a walking path which is nice, but most of our view was dominated by desolate ground where they plan on building more towers. Kids activites were sparse and several included a fairly hefty charge - at least the charges seemed high to me when I was multiplying them by 3 kids.

When we got back, it was all fixed and we had a cute towel elephant waiting for us on our dinner table. With that being said, all of these items are trivial. This hotel is new and wonderful. We booked early and paid a low $115 per night for our stay. We ended up delaying our flight a couple of days and to our dismay, (should have checked with the hotel first), the hotel only had one studio available for Friday and Saturday nights with a rate of $179 per night....we really needed the larger room for our family, so we ended up going to a different hotel that had a suite available.

Right now, though, the expansion area seems to be abandoned, giving the property the feel of a swank hotel built in a war zone. If you can, get a room facing WDW and the pool so you can see the fireworks and not the expansion area (i.e., face away from Palm Parkway); our 1BR faced the rather desolate looking expansion area, so we tended to keep the shades drawn.

The pool! My family loved swimming together. Wish there was a swim up bar though! The only valid criticism I have is the quality of the blanket on the pull-out sofa bed. If you have a kiddo who will be bunking on the couch, maybe you can pick them up a blanket somewhere, like at a discount Disney shop. The supplied spare blanket is made of a yellow foam material. My little one did not like the blanket at all and I could not blame her. It seemed very uncomfortable. I called to explain the problem and asked for another comforter. They said they'd send one right away. When the room attendant came to the door, a language barrier prevented the two of us from communicating effectively. He gave us another one of the yellow foam blankets. I wanted a comforter but he told me that all the comforters are being washed and that he'd bring me one when they were dried.

The current pricing of about $140 per night for the 1 bedroom units makes the place an incredible value though. The resort is relatively new, so the condition of the property and rooms was excellent. It is a growing resort with space already cleared for several more towers. The resort is nicely situated close to the action but far enough away so you are not looking out over other development.

I suggest you compare the regular rooms and The Penthouse Premier rooms prior to checking in and you decide if it's worth the xtra consumption of points. HGVC used to have a \"plus\" designation and I believe many times it was justified but now this property adds \"penthouse\" and then an additional \"premier\" to really milk the points. Did you know that within 30 days a two-bed penthouse premier can be purchased with cash and cost you no more than a regular two-bed unit even though the points are almost triple.

At least 2 or 3 more towers will be constructed over the next decade, yet the property offers a lot of services even though it's under development. Units are set up like modern time-share condos.

Although the Hilton brochure stated that the room would not be cleaned every day, I was pleasantly surprised to find a spotless room when I returned every evening. When the maid realized I was using the kitchen to its fullest extent, she left extra supplies and kitchen towels. Maids also left friendly handwritten notes each day. It was a treat to watch the amusement park fireworks at night from my balcony. The time always varied, and the fireworks were quite a distance away, but I enjoyed the show. I also liked the parking garage - what a great idea! As other reviewers have noted, unless you plan to stay only at the resort property, it's a good idea to rent a car. A few smaller hotels are within walking distance, but I don't know if they have restaurants or lounges. Many fine restaurants and fast fooders are a very short drive away, and it's not necessary to go out onto busy roads to reach them.

Hilton staff also patiently explained how to get to various places in Orlando and central Florida.

We found this hotel on the internet, and it looked great. the price was excellent - $169 per night was our rate for a one bedroom with a full kitchen and king size pull out couch in the livingroom. I surfed the net when we were here, just to compare rates for this time of year, and this was a great rate, considering the amenities. ROOM: Very nice, new room. Very large. Very nice bathroom with double sink, separate tub and large glass enclosed shower. Kitchen had everything (although could have used a few more dishes - we were always running out as they only supply 4 of everything). This room would be perfect if it had (a) another closet - there is only one in the bedroom (b) more storage for clothing. There were next to no drawers for longer stays, so the room seemed to be contantly messy and (c) a desk to sit at for computer, etc. It was simply underfurnished and there is lots of room to add a dresser and desk. Balconies were large and very nice with lounger and table with four chairs. Our room faced the Magic Kingdom area, which was kind of neat as you could see the fireworks each night. but this got \"old\" after the first couple of nights and so I think if I came back, I would ask for the pool view room, which faces the beautiful pool area. Oh, we only had our beds made and kitchen cleaned if we left a tip. I think generally, they just supply clean towels, and only clean once per week. but if we left a tip, we had the whole room cleaned while out, if we forgot, no go! POOL: Gorgeous, well-heated so that the kids could still swim even in the cooler weather. Three lovely hot tubs for the adults. The water slide was a kit with the kids, but it was a bit frustrating in that you never seemed to know when it would be operating. It requires a staff person to attend it and they seemed to come and go without any real schedule. RESTAURANT: Food was good, service ok. It's nice that it is open air and faces the pool area, so the kids can swim and parents can enjoy a cocktail - very \"resort-like\". CONCIERGE: This was the most frustratng aspect of our trip, as we had a couple of questions about the resort so we called down and were told to go to the front desk for information! My husband and I both had issues with the Concierge and thought it was funny at a new hotel, that they would not be more helpful. NOISE: The walls really are paper thin and we seemed to have a particularly loud family beside us on a few of the days - we could literally hear their conversations! This was only for a few of the nights so is likely luck of the draw in terms of who your neighbours are and how loud they get. LOCATION: Excellent. Close to everything. Walmart just up the road, parks within 10 minutes drive, tons of restaurants. But you would want a car. OVERALL: We enjoyed our stay and, at this rate, we would certainly consider returning again. Of special note was the social staff who made Christmas eve and New Years eve really special for the kids, and were always working hard around the pool hosting trivia contests, etc.", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cThe Pros and Cons\u201d", "Author": "senoritav", "ReviewID": "UR52108606", "Content": "Spent 11 nights at the Parc Soleil...regrettably, the weather was cool,cloudy and rainy for the most part.

The grounds were lovely (but there is pending construction behind tower 2...which is yet to be opened).

It is however a bigger issue than any of the other reviews have made. You may well be two miles from Disney World but it will cost you 35 bucks in a cab. You can however get the hotel shuttle and it only costs 6 bucks return. It runs on time and only goes to other Hiltons so only takes 40 mins max and Parc Soleil seems to be the first drop off so you're back from the parks in 20 mins. There are three drop off and pickup times. The biggest drawback is the fact that you cannot walk anywhere from your hotel as there are no walkways. You have a major road with no pavements at the entrance to your hotel so you MUST use a car or taxi to go anywhere.

I was pleased to see such a nice resort. We are fairly new HGVC owners and really enjoyed our time at this resort. It was very clean and well maintained. The room we had on the 9th floor overlooked the pools and was a nice view. However we did not have much sun on our balcony at all. The rooms were well equipped with everything you needed to stay comfortably for a week or so. The furniture was nice as well as the very comfortable king size bed. French doors closed off the bedroom from the living room so that we could both relax and watch our own choices of TV. First thing you need to do when going to this resort is book a rental car and look for package deals on the theme parks prior to going. We booked the rental car from Dollar and got a 9 day rate of just under $300. Not bad. On the theme park tickets, we purchased them at the front desk at the hotel and we paid way too much for them. Don't get me wrong...they were very helpful there but you get a much better deal if you go online prior and order a package deal for your tickets. I didn't realize this. The more days & parks you visit - the better the price. There is a Walmart close by to get groceries from which we made many trips to. We ate at Olive Garden on International Drive one night and our server \"Jason\" was fantastic! Two thumbs up for Jason!!! I have a food allergy to deal with and he was great. Also ate at the hotel restaurant one night and it was good too. Cooked many of our meals in the room. We went to 2 outlet malls \"Prime and Premium\" which are both nearby. If you like shopping - go there!!! Fantastic shopping! The pools at the resort were very comfortable. Very clean too! Great waterslide. This resort is still under construction as they are finishing up a second tower but the noise factor was to an extreme minimum. Never bothered us at all. Don't hesitate to go there because of this construction because you will really be missing out on a lot. Also had a great gym to workout. Also enjoyed the secure entrance to the resort and the underground parking. Nice. This place is a very nice location if you want to stay in Orlando but do not want to be right in the middle of driving chaos.

This hotel seems to be the 1st in this area, probably due to the credit crunch, many developments seem to be on hold. Once completed this will be a massive resort. We stayed in building 1 which was the only one open.

My husband thought the water slide was great, although it would have been good to have something for the little kids, my son was really upset that he was too small to go on the slide. The hotel hosts dive in movie nights by the pool, and they leave you a message on your answering service to let you know the details. We had take away dinner from the restaurant which was nice and convenient. Parking is plentiful, with spaces in a main carpark near the lobby or in the basement of the builidng.

The bell men and front desk staff knew us by name as soon as we stepped in the door, I don't know how, but that was amazing!! All in all, the staff was very personable and accommodating to my family, I can't recall a hotel where we were treated like such VIP's!! Third, the rooms are just absolutely impressive. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite, which in all honesty isn't a normal room; in fact, these rooms are more like condos! They have a full kitchen, washer & dryer, separate living area, huge bathroom, and luxurious bedroom. I still can't believe for the price, the quality of room you get. I think these rooms should be going for around $250/night - when we paid only $126/night. I think you will be hard pressed to find such an upscale hotel as this in Orlando at any better rate. Lastly, I'll quickly touch on the pool and restaurant. The beach/pool area is great for the kids. The hotel puts on daily activities for children (and the adults too), which keeps them occupied if your just hanging around and not out at the parks. The slide is just like any you'd find at a water park, and there are separate pools for kids and older adults. The pool side restaurant is just as good as any in the Orlando area, and service lives up the Hilton name.

While the amenities represent standard fare for a HGVC property, the design and appointment of the rooms was superior to most.

Amenities We visited during a slow period in Orlando, so we practically had the resort to ourselves.

Unfortunately, we felt this may have had a negative impact on the pool-side bartender, as his personality left little to be desired. the pool was uninspired, but the waterslide somewhat made up for it.

There are two pools - one with a water slide. Disney is just 2-3 miles down. Universal a little more in the other direction. The only sticky point came when my autistic daughter got a little injured after coming down the water slide. She was immediately attended to by the stuff - nice people. But then came big manager - straight out of Hollywood movies (like Get Shorty). He insisted I give a signed statement that nobody was responsible. It finally did not happen since we kept missing each other (I would be out of room when he would call) but I was surprised that he kept insisting even when I told repeatedly everything was fine.", "Date": "September 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cWe lovedddd this Resort, planning our 2nd trip for march 2010!!\u201d", "Author": "danieldiaz", "ReviewID": "UR39356146", "Content": "Well I dont know where to start this place was great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!....it did have a few kinks but overall 9 out of 10 and i'll explain the reason for this rating. We stayed here from 08/20 to 08/25 we booked a King one bedroom Suite .. we arrived at roughly 1 am we were greeted with a smile and Front desk was very niceee and we basically had the quickest check in at a hotel by the time the Rep finished welcoming us she knew my name and had our room keys ready and we were off to our room..... let me start by saying there is only one tower currently working it has 15 floors our room was in the 9th floor #1901 (i requested a high floor with a nice view ) and we got a beautiful view of the main pool and entrance...and what a view that was everymorning just gorgeous pool area. the room was spotlessss....i was clean , very roomy for 2 ppl... the kitchen was fully stocked... with plates,silverware,cups,glasses,wine glasses, along with cooking pots....(by the way the oven is some new convection oven type.....im very tech savy but boy did it take me a few tries to get the damn oven to work lmao but once its working its jsut great lol) the frigde was just great with lots of space so was the dishwasher(you get 2 pack of detergent for the DW, located under the sink) also you get a Washer dryer combination which came in super handy with all the shopping we did we washed everything and came back with all clean clothes.... the living area was great and spacious has a very big comfortable sofa that is also a new type of sofa bed which was veryyyy comfy for a sofabed(we tried it while watching tv and it was great) the tv in the living room was like a 37\" plasma and we had a 30\" or 32\" in the bedroom... do not expect good picture quality from the regular channels if you are not familiar w/HD the normal stations will be a bit fuzzy due to tv connections but once you reach an HD channel (which come included) you will get perfect image quality also in the living room you have an HD dvd player ..... ( i brought my Xbox 360 but could not use it due to internet connection, so i jsut stuck to using the dvd player) now for the bedroom/bathroom.... what a sight the french door leading to the bedroom are great and give it a very relaxed feel to the room.... the bed was omg heavennnn and dont get me started on the pillows... (lets jsut say was tempted to take a few back home lol) yes sleeping here is like floating on a cloud the bed ,sheet and pillows were just fantasticcccc..... the room closethas electronic safe which we used veryy much..... now the bathroom was one of the best features of the King 1 bedroom Suite... VERY MODERN AND RELAXING WITH LOTS OF ROOMMMM.... we loved the double vanity .... the stand-in shower was great u can fit like 4 ppl inside but it was jsut perfect for us 2 lol..... also it had 2 shower heads one on the wall and the other was handheld adjustable ...so 2 ppl can shower with out a problem.... the soak tub.... was totally cool and old world type... was very comfortable tub to lay in (even for 2 ppl) we loved the water spout from the ceiling (falls kinda hard but onces theres water in the tub sounds fine ) the bathroom has a seperate area for the toilet which u can divided from the main bathroom (showers and sink) there also a second entrance from a door in front of the dinnin room .. which comes in handy ..... the balcony was really nice and big lots of space had furniture there was a table for 4 and a nice seat to lay in...... the hotel itself was always clean and tidy the hallway was always empty and clean... the whole time we were there only saw 2 other guest from our floor , they very a nice couple.... now the Pool area...was just great and cool..... we enjoyed both the main pool with the water slide(yes im 27 but there were ppl of all ages ans sizes jumpin down) the slide was very very cool for a resort pool so that was always fun.... the main pool was pretty much empty thourhg the week only on sat and sun did we see a few families and couples with kids in the pool but still it was never croweded.... theres also a second more private pool which mostly i saw being used by adults ... we were always at the pool by 8 am b4 heading out about our days at the parks.... the cabanas are mostly empty until prob midday ..by then the 3 cabanas at the main pool would be taken but there still 4 more on the second pool .... there are alos roughly 3 or 4 spa pools thoughout the whole complex... these are veryyyyyyyyyyyy relaxing after a lonnngggg day of walking....... We were the only ones (from what we saw) who made use of the BBQ grill and grill area.... i loved it.....there are 6 grills for use and a nice spacious bbq area.... it on the back side of first tower (just take the lake trail) this is right next to the the joggin trail that goes around a medium sized lake area..... ohhh yes and now the few kinks i spoke about in this hotel.... BEWARE of the Lanline Internet connection it did not work at all..... if the wireless was wornkin i would not know did not have wireless equipment but the room do come reay for interconnection from the wall socket using and Ethernet cable...this service never worked....there are 2 plug conections one in the bedroom by a nite stand and the second in in the living behind the side table... i had someone from Enginnering come take a look he did best he could never solved the issue he stated he reffered the problem to the engineer who handle land lines but that person never made any contact with us nor left any type of msgs...so we left this problem as unresolved and went about our vacation( so much for carryin our xbox to play on Live) second but this was not a bother at all but would have been great (especially when u are super tried from outside) was no room service from the cafe downstairs im hoping in the future it changes...the only thing they have is they are able to make the charges to your room if you'd like....but thats about it....this wasnt major but we jsut wanted to make note of it..... this hotel is a wonderful and excellent place to stay for all ages .....def recommend it if you want to get a clean modern room and beautiful pool areas..... Now i will mention someone that no one has mentioned.... transportation!!! we did not rent a car.... we used cabs to and from places...First off let me start by saying you can def use this form or travel but renting a car is recommended and i do not say this becasue of the location ...this is located very near all the parks especially Sea world...is literally 5 mins from the hotel.... but yeah we spent alot of unecessary money on cabs.... they charge for evertyhing and if theres traffic and ur stuck boi that meter just keeps charging u.... so yes if you can avoid having to use cabs pls do so also a side note when booking ur trip with the expedia rep in the lobby do not use their transporation it is very well priced 12 roundtrip to and from the park but they are very unreliable on our first day we went to universal studios our pick up was to be @ 5pm.. we were at designated stop since 4:53 pm and by 5:30 still waiting we decided to call the place only to have some very rude indian guy barley understood english when asked what happened to the pickup the guy said \" he already did pick up, talk to boss next pickup at 7pm\" that was the line he repeated 3 times.... after payin our money and now being made to wait 2 hrs for a next we pretty much had no choice and get on a cab and pay rough 44 plus tips to get back to the hotel......no one took resposiblity and we cannot blame hotel since expedia just works out of a small stand in the hotel.... but yes be veryyy carefull when using their service its called Sterlin Transportation...... they are not very friendly either the guy who did the pick up was a complete A.. and swore he was too good to even say good morning when greeted.... but yeah that was pretty much it hope it helped lol also i will be posting pics soon....took over 900 so i have to sort out the few i can post on here for you guys to view.... anyquestion just send a msg over i'll gladly anser", "Date": "August 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cImpressed\u201d", "Author": "cjd609", "ReviewID": "UR38759175", "Content": "We stood at this hotel for 4 nights.

The only downside of the hotel is no room service. They just opened the fitness center the second day we were there. Its smaller than expected but very nice. Also watch out for the marketing manager. She had called us about the promotion they do to buy shares and get free gifts, BUT you have to make OVER $70,000 annually or you do not qualify for the free gifts.

If you want to know what our view was like and the view of our hotel then I recorded a little video for people back home during the time we were there. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQquMXjomHA The only bad point was the location. We didn't hire a car initially as we were going to the parks via the Hotel shuttle ($6 return to all parks) and the shuttle was perfect and always on time. The last few days of our stay we decided to hire a car and pick up from the Dollar location in Lake Beuna Vista. I'd definitely recommend a car for this location as there isn't any shops or places to eat nearby.", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cNice but don't stay in the studio\u201d", "Author": "DisneyFan51", "ReviewID": "UR38735598", "Content": "This was our second stay at the Parc Soleil. It's a beautiful resort - a bit isolated, but only 5 minutes from restaurants, stores, etc. On our first stay was in a one bedroom, which was absolutely beautiful and large with a full kitchen, washer and dryer. In the evenings, we were able to view the Disney fireworks from our terrace. On our most recent trip, we stayed in the studio unit. First, there was no balcony and the room was very, very small, about 1/4 the size of the one bedroom and only about $20 less per night. We were unable to sleep and kept waking up throughout the night because the air conditioning unit was right near the bed and kept coming on loudly. Also the tv was very fuzzy. We had asked to upgrade to a larger room but none were available. Overall, the resort is lovely, beautiful pools, nice restaurant and they recently opened the gym. We found everyone who worked there was very pleasant and went out of their way to make you feel welcomed.
