That was the only negative for us though. The bathroom was spotless with an excellent shower, lovely big towels too. The bed was extremely comfortable and I usually find mattresses in hotels/B and Bs way too soft. We slept very well there.

Though I anticipated a small room, I have to admit that I was truly stunned when I saw the room and realized what small really meant. It was minuscule and almost impossible to accommodate my husband and I with our suitcases. I know that when you go to Paris you don't expect to stay in the room, but the size and decor was actually uncomfortable and I felt claustrophobic. I could barely open my suitcase as there was just no space. We stayed only 2 nights - on our way back from Nice - and i don't think I could have managed much more than that. The only reasons why I haven't given it a lower score, is that there were some conveniences which I have to account for. Without these, I really don't think it would be worth more than two TA dots. So, if these are important to you, here were the good points about the hotel for us: 1. Free Wi-fi 2. Continental Breakfast included (though limited seating) 3.

It may look to be a little out of the centre of the city, but it is very close to a Metro station and with trains every few minutes, getting to other parts of Paris is easy and quick... and inexpensive if one buys the appropriate Metro pass. Our comfortable room overlooked a grand, wide Parisian boulevarde with rows of trees breaking up the traffic lanes. Daumesnil offers a good selection of eating places where great evening meals can be had at a reasonable price . We found the hotel staff to be happy,friendly, efficent people who did everything possible to make us welcome. Although our arrival time was at about 11 pm, this presented no problem. The lift/elevator which we took to our room was perfectly Parisian...it accomodated one person plus our luggage. When we asked advice about the best way of getting to various places, they invariably gave helpful, accurate information. Our room, though not large, was fine. It overlooked the magnificent Ave Daumesnil. We had a grandstand view of Paris life, but noise from the street was not a problem. On days when we had breakfast there, it was excellent When we were leaving and decided that a taxi to Gare du Nord would be appropriate, they had a cab there for us within a minute.

Very easy to find, but you should get to grips with the metro system first. It cost us around 7 euros for a weekend pass on the metro. It took us everywhere and it's very easy with the map provided by the hotel. You get the RER B from the airport, then change and get the RER A, then change onto the metro and get off at daumesnil. Very cheap and very easy. The room size has been exaggerated. Ok, they are not massive, but there was plenty of room. Very clean and modern. The lift is small, but it's just a lift. The metro station is actually only a 20 second walk. It's practically on the doorstep. Very safe area. Very helpful staff. Our breakfast was included. I don't understand the comments about having to pay for breakfast. We had no hassle. I will be back to Paris next year as 3 days isn't enough. I was hesitant about staying here because of previous comments about room size etc but I'm glad I ignored them. Perfect hotel in a great location.

Paying on average about \u00a3100 a night, I expected a little more, even if Paris is an expensive city for hotels. The room was very small, which I knew before. But there was no heater in the washroom (and no heated towel rack, either). This isn't a problem in the spring and summer. But when it's fall and winter, a different story. When I brought this up with one of the receptionists, he abruptly said that's the way it's been for 100 years. Doesn't make it right, does it? This same gentlemen seemed bothered, too, when I told him that a light wasn't working in my room. He huffed and puffed before, and during, changing the light. Totally unprofessional. He got annoyed in the first place because I didn't know how to use the safe. Problem was, a very important piece of the instructions regarding the safe was left out. Geraldine was always helpful, though. The second day, when I came back from work, my door was left open, probably by housekeeping, as in, my key didn't work but I was still able to open the door with virtually no force. And here was the kicker. The receptionist on the final day, an elderly petite woman, said I didn't need to book a cab to get to the train station. All I had to do was come down, she said, she'd call one, and it would be there in 5-10 mins. So I did that. I went down at 9 am. No cab at 9:10. No cab at 9:20. Finally a cab at 9:30. I told her that I was ticked because she said I didn't have to call a cab before hand, which she didn't appreciate. The thing was - and she's likely the owner of the hotel - there was a taxi stand about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. What kind of service is that? She couldn't tell me this?

The best thing about the hotel is it's location, very close to Daumensil metro station which is only a few stops from the city centre. The area seemed pretty safe and there were bars, restaurants and supermarkets very close by. Contrary to other reviewers I found that the staff did not speak a word of English, they were pleasant enough though. My room was on the 6th floor, a tiny rickety lift went as far as the 5th floor and I had to carry my bags up the last flight of stairs. The room was absolutely tiny with hardly any space to move around in, although this seems to be common in Paris, and there was only a shower and no bath in the bathroom. The bed was very hard and extremely uncomfortable and the aircon did't work making the room strangely hot considering the weather outside, opening the window made it too noisy to sleep.

We decided to walk from the Gare de Lyon to our hotel - on hindsight we should have taken a metro to the station local to the hotel - much quicker! The receptionist, Geraldine, was very helpful & furnished us with all kinds of maps & aids of Paris. We had asked for a quiet room when we booked & were allocated room 108. The room was small but we had expected this from the reviews we had read prior to our departure for Paris. The bathroom was very adequate with an excellent shower unit & everything that is required for a short stay, including a hairdryer. The bedroom had an excellent air conditioning unit & not too noisy. It also had a flat screen TV & coffee/tea making facilities. My only reservation with the bedroom was the under blanket on the bed - it was designed for persons with incontinence problems. This gave the effect, on hot nights, that a very hot electric blanket was on maximum heat. Maybe I should have brought this to their attention but chose not to. The breakfasts were to our taste - we don't go for the full English type - plenty of cold meats, cheese, cereals, yoghurts, spreads, rolls & toasting bread. All in all, a good little hotel, reasonably priced and very pleasant staff.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waterloo, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel on Avenue Daumesnil\u201d", "Author": "mickeeD", "ReviewID": "UR117255406", "Content": "Grand Hotel Dore was a clean, friendly, and reasonably priced hotel on the east side of the City.

My French friend who lives in Paris says they're a rip off for tourists. Instead we got the simple Mobilis day ticket, unlimited journeys on the Metro (no real need to use the RER, or buses) for 6euros.

That saved our trip for sure. And also I asked if there was a nearby laundry where we could drop off some wash & pick it up next day. The manager, Mr Zyad (who we knew from the Grand Hotel Francais) verified we just needed regular laundry wash, dry, fold and said that they could do it there at the hotel.

On the day we arrived tea & coffee, and a bottle of water and soda were left for us in the room as a welcome gift. The room also had a window that looked down on to the main street, it was a lovely view because the road is full of trees. The location is great...its not central but its quiet and has easy access to the metro station ( 2 mins walk from hotel) Make sure you buy a \"PARIS VISITE\" ticket, its for ALL public transport (RER, bus & metro)..we bought one for 5 days and it costs 49E for zones 1-6 ( or you can buy a 28E one for zones 1-3 which is ONLY for travelling round the center of paris) We bought the 1-6 zone one because we wanted to use it to travel from and to the airport & to go to Disneyland. Its was probably the best thing we bought in Paris because it saved us so much money...the metro from airport (CDG) to Paris costs 9 euros!! A few tips from me: BEWARE of the people that are shuffling three black round things (one of the round things has a white mark on it and you have to find the mark to win) they are EVERYWHERE and they con tourists...the people that are standing round them are all in on the con pretending they are betting. They took 100 euros out of our hands and wouldnt gve it us back!!!! DO NOT PLAY..nobody ever wins!! ( we saw a couple lose 250e in 2 mins) If you buy souvenirs off people on the street try to make them give them to you for a better price... eg. i bought a photo frame for 5 euros instead of 12euros which was his first offer ;) If you're planning on going to Paris i hope you have a great time!!! just like we did :) xx", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cEfficient, warm, welcoming, helpful\u201d", "Author": "Sarahmai87", "ReviewID": "UR95517974", "Content": "Lovely little hotel with the metro at the doorstep.

The sights of Paris are all spread out, so to be honest it isn't too far out, it is only a few stops from Notre Damn, Louvre etc. As long as you plan your sightseeing and work your way back towards the hotel is fine, (for example to the Eiffell Tower took 30-335minutes on the tube, no changes which is the opposite side of the city, so not too bad!! Maybe i'm just being picky!!!). On the positive, it was easy to get to from both Gare Du Nord and from the airport (when using the train/Orly bus as both come into Gare Du Nord).

Who says that??? Anyway, after getting into the world's smallest lift with only a carry-on (large people would be forced to use the stairs), we then found we had booked the smallest room ever. Bare bones, firm double bed (I booked two beds-which were \"not available\"), with a flat screen television and a wardrobe. The bathroom was the nicest part of the room, very modern and clean-but the shower handles kept falling off. Again, it was a place to rest our head, so it sufficed.

Friendly reception, sans the poor mannners from the manager. TIPS: Do not listen to the reception's direction to take the bus, which is a 45 minute ride from Gare du Nord! Take the Metro which is only minutes to Daumesnil using the same carnets! Also, we found out there was a breakfast available only AFTER we were checking out (turned out to be expensive anyway)-but there IS a Monoprix only a block away which has inexpensive fresh, yummy croissants and other pastries, along with beverages. I personally wouldn't stay here again, as I like hotel stays to be at least as nice and comfortable, if not moreso, as my own home. We are returning to Paris to take the Versailles bike tour in June, and I'll be trying out a different hotel this time.", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely recommended - couple of small improvements would make it perfect\u201d", "Author": "LostAndFoundUK", "ReviewID": "UR56758030", "Content": "I have recently completed a stay at the Grand Hotel Dore with my partner. We both thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We look forward to staying there again in the future, and would strongly recommend this hotel to friends. Location: Daumesnil, literally 30 seconds from the metro which provides easy access into the city centre. Getting back to the hotel on the metro was never an issue for us, and only takes around 10-15 minutes. The hotel is located literally 30 seconds from Daumesnil metro. We prefer to stay a little out of the city centre, as we prefer the quieter surroundings and less touristy restaurants etc. If you prefer to be right in the centre, this hotel would be less ideal. However, the metro makes it incredibly easy to move around. Some nice restaurants in the area (see my other reviews when I get round to writing them!) Rooms: They are small, there's no two ways about it. Ours definitely seemed smaller than the pictures of the standard room on the virtual tour on TripAdvisor. However, this in no way spoiled our stay. WIdth wise the room had a double bed with a bedside table either side, and this reached the wall on both sides, therefore only around a foot of carpet around the bed. Due to limited storage for a longer stay, we weren't able to unpack properly therefore had clothes on the desk etc. Again, a very minor problem. Bathroom: Quite sizeable considering the compact nature of the room. Shower was a cubical, small but usable (despite me being quite tall). Very powerful. Had a luke-warm shower one evening, but mornings always had plentiful hot water. Fresh towels & toiletries every day was a very impressive bonus. Bathroom was pristinely clean, and decorated very well. If slightly larger, bathroom and shower would compare to some 4/5* hotels we have stayed in in the past. Bed: Bed comfy. Pillows small and lumpy. This was the only real problem with our stay. Only one pillow each, and they were quite poor. My partner had to put towels into the pillow cases in order to get any sleep as they provided very little support. We didn't raise this with the hotel but perhaps should have. Air Conditioning/Heating: Seemed to be under some sort of central control with some ability to mildly alter temperature by the user. The night we arrived room was very warm as heating was on due to wintery temperatures outside. We tried to turn the AC on to put out some cold air but were unable to. Therefore only solution was to open room windows before bed for a few minutes and turn entire system off. Even then, on subsequent nights room was very warm, necessitating opening windows in the night to air the room. Breakfast: Cold, continental style breakfast. Very good quality pastries, cold meats, yogurts, bread, fruit juice, cereals & coffee. Complimentary English & French newspapers for all guests provided a welcome addition. Only slight negative was breakfast room was quite compact & on one occasion we had to return 20 minutes later to have breakfast as no seats on our first attempt. Breakfast served til 10.30 so allowed a sleep-in if desired. Would definitely recommend breakfast if you can get a good deal to have it included. Staff: Very friendly staff at desk & cleaners etc. Eager to help and good level of English made communication very easy due to our limited French! Only problem encountered was how to keep staff out of room! We were unable to find any do not disturb notices, therefore staff came every morning at approximately 11 to change towels etc. WiFi: Free WiFi to guests. Had trouble connecting. Would sometimes require 10-20 connection attempts. When connected, was fast and worked very well. Recommendations to Hotel owners: 1) Consider buying some new pillows (x2 per guest would be ideal) 2) Provide Do Not Disturb notices for guests who wish to sleep in 3) Allow guests greater control of Air Conditioning/Heating system 4) Keep doing what you're doing, improvements are very minor and would in no way prevent me recommending this hotel to our friends & coming to stay with you again! Summary: This is an almost perfect hotel, if you know what it offers. That is an extremely clean, compact room in outer Paris with an excellent staff. If you want a larger room/more central location, it isn't for you. Otherwise, stop looking, and book this hotel! NB: On re-reading my review, it seems very negative. This in no way was our experience of this hotel. It was an excellent stay, and would be perfect with the alterations above.", "Date": "February 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cA Great Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "JamesAW", "ReviewID": "UR55317923", "Content": "We were in Paris for a 5day sightseeing trip and the hotel was perfect for our needs.

We were warmly greeted by the reception staff who took our luggage from us and gave us a map of Paris with all the attractions on it and easily marked. This became our \"bible\" for the weekend. He showed us which Metro lines got us where and which bus routes to take. The Metro stop is right outside and is very handly to get you anywhere and everywhere in a reasonable time, although you did usually have to change lines but only once. It is clean and reliable. We got passes from the station at CDG airport for 3 days which cost around 38 euros and is worth every cent. It can be used on every tram,train and bus. We had a wander up the Seine and headed back to the hotel around 3pm to check in. The lift can only fit 1 person and a medium sized suitcase but you could probably squeeze more in if necessary. Our room was on the 4th floor with a view over the road. You can slightly heard the Metro underneath the hotel but it was nothing more than a low rumble.

The slippers are also a very welcoming comfort after a long day wandering the streets and sights of Paris. Breakfast is also lovely, although eating ham and cheese at breakfast felt a bit strange! Our only complaints were the price of drinks (6 euros for a not-exact pint of beer!!) but we found a supermarket a little further a long from the hotel and it was cheaper to get alcohol from there (3 bottles of beer and 3 bottles of smirrnoff ice - just under 8 euros). The other thing wich isn't really a complaint but an annoyance was the RER to the airport was on strike on the day we were due to fly back home. We only found this out when we got to the Metro station. The alternates are get a Metro to Opera and get the \"Roissybus\" which would take over an hour and you are likely to get stuck in traffic or get a taxi. We ordered ours back at the hotel, it arrived in less than 5 mins and we arrived at the airport in 30 mins! It cost 36 euros which works out around \u00a325 and at least we knew we were there in time for the flight. We recommend going up the Eiffel Tower and is definately worth the long queue and the 12 euro admission fee, the view is amazing even though i am scared of hieghts! A boat trip down the Seine in also nice (11 euro - from Pont Neuf). All in all, a really nice and relaxing break.", "Date": "September 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "beds", "Title": "\u201cNice little haven\u201d", "Author": "rosebug", "ReviewID": "UR18490678", "Content": "Located in Daumesnil, 12th arondissement, this hotel is on the outskirts of town but metro right outside takes you into centre in 15 minutes, well served by buses too.

A nice little touch was the slippers and box of chocolates in our room on arrival ! The location was great, the metro station couldn't have been any closer and is served by two very useful lines..you can get to anywhere in central paris you would want by one of the two. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. Our breakfast was included and was very nice, however I wouldn't have paid the price for it if it wasn't and picked something up at one of the many nearby bakeries instead.

I have stayed in a lot of hotels in Europe and this was easily the smallest. That being said, there were 3 of us (3 adults), but still...the room basically was a bathroom and a double and a single bed with maybe a 4'x2' space of carpet. However, the room is comfortable and if you are going to Paris, how much time are you spending in the room? We slept there and that was it, so it was enough. -While the Metro is VERY close, the Metro is Paris is slow. We found riding the Metro a hassle (as opposed to Madrid where it seems you get around quicker on the Metro). It was to the point where we would not want to go out for dinner mainly because we felt like it would require 30 or 40 minutes on the Metro to get to anywhere good. The hotel is kind of on the outside, and with the million Metro stops in Paris, expect a good 12+ stops to get anywhere from the Daumesnil (hotel) stop. -Very tiny elevator, so if you have lots of luggage that will take a few trips or else carry it up yourself. Overall, a very satisfactory hotel for sleeping and seeing Paris. Not super expensive compared to most Parisian hotels and the quality of the room itself was fine, if not cramped. If you want luxury and spacious accomodations, look elsewhere. If you want a comfortable room to sleep in and crash in and don't mind a bit of a jaunt to get into the main part of the city every day, it is a great little hotel.", "Date": "March 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "hampshire", "Title": "\u201ctotally enjoyed\u201d", "Author": "montyHampshire", "ReviewID": "UR10693631", "Content": "We had a few worries after reading mixed reviews about this hotel !We needn't have worried, it is lovely little hotel.The room was a decent size and both the bedroom and ensuite are decorated to a high standard(very modern).The location was perfect for walking or taking the metro .

Always ready to ring for a taxi or advise on a restaurant... BUT. The BUT is in the rooms. We, friends and us, stayed in rooms 102 and 643. 643 is poky but just about ok for a couple of nights but no more. 102.... Hmmm, what to say about 102. It's really a single room with a double bed in it. I, the fat one, got to sleep on the far side of the bed.. That meant I was the one trying to pass a chair and a table with about 6 inches of space- NOT enough to put one foot in front of the other, shuffling like an idiot and trying not to fall on top of bed or out the window. We looked in a couple of the other rooms and they were fine. Lots of room and possible to sit in the chair and put on your shoes instad of hopping about like a twit and eventually giving up and agreeing with the wife whos' turn it is to stand up! The shower is just a tube with a door and a power shower. Too tiny to pick up the soap after dropping it and, for some inexplicable reason, the staff always put the shower head up in the vertical position so, when you turn on the shower, you get a faceful or it goes out the the bathroom door.... interesting but not much fun when it's cold! The room sports a fridge, very useful for those chilled drinks.. Ours didn't seem to want to do very much. Cool but not chilled I'd say. However, that is just a minor glitch. Water is always hot, windows open all the way, (Provided you don't want to stand there as well!) and the bed was firm and warm. The AC worked fine and the decor was pretty good.
