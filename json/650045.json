Bedroom part was spacious enough to maneuver around easily; bathroom was pretty tight -- fine for a slim solo traveler, but I wouldn't want to share it. It was shower-only; tiles were a peculiar wood-grain pattern, but water pressure was nice and hot and stall had plexiglass doors (not something I take for granted in cheap hotels!). Noise was usual level for small urban hotel -- some street noise, some sounds from hallway, but nothing overly disruptive. WiFi free but very slow (you have to register through a third-party service, Noodo), so that would have been a downside if staying here for business; since I was here only overnight, it was not a big deal. AMEX card didn't work the next morning, so I ended up paying cash; the clerks' tags helpfully indicate which languages they speak, and I think every one I encountered was trilingual (French, English, and Arabic).", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cClean, Welcoming, Friendly\u201d", "Author": "Nimrud", "ReviewID": "UR119364345", "Content": "Stopped over for one night between a late Eurostar and a mid morning TGV to Dijon. The whole hotel was clean and the staff friendly and helpful although the confusion over how much we should be paying in the morning was unexpected. We did panic as we walked up the street in the dark and could see no sign, especially since the view on G*maps shows the refurbishment! Once there and checked in we asked about restaurants and Le Viaduc was suggested. Even with the window open slightly the room was quiet. Breakfast was fine and reasonably quiet. Having stayed in other Paris hotels where breakfast was complete chaos this was a nice change. The hotel's leaflet about the walk along the Promenade Plantee was interesting as we had already walked this about two years before as far as the Bois de Vincennes.

The earlier feeling was only due to the fact that we hardly spent any time in the room - even 3 days in Paris (in a whirlwind tour) does not provide you the luxury of doing so. Anyway, the room itself was comfy enough, equipped with a bath-tub which came handy to relax in after the day's exertions. Located proximal to the Gare de Lyon (5 min walk), it provided a good base to explore Paris from. Although you might be better off in the Latin Quarter as it is closer to the heart of Paris. Lots of good eateries and convenience stores nearby as well. The receptionists spoke good English and were helpful in providing directions and tips in touring the city.

All the hotel staff we dealt with spoke English and were very helpful. We paid extra for the breakfast for one morning and that was good being held in the renovated cellar which had a nice atmosphere. The Hotel is located close to the Gare de Lyon. The only suggestion for improvement is the rooms lack air-con(seems fairly typical around France) and although the temp was only between 25-30 Celsius the room was getting a bit stuffy so I not too sure what it would be like in high summer. The only way to cool the room was opening the windows which then let a bit of noise in. The windows were double glazed so it certainly was quiet when they were closed.

We called the front desk many times, yet, the owner of the hotel was the unfriendly one. We were being frightened by his impoliteness, and rudeness (esp. when we dont understand any French) The walls are quite thin... so we did wake up easily by any single noise.
