My husband and I decided to head to Napa for the weekend-but we had no reservations booked, and I walked in the lobby at 4:00PM and asked if they had any last minute specials. They offered me a King room at $295, which he said was normally $435, and rates jump up to $600 in the summer. So that was fantastic. What I didn't know was how much it included! Wifi, a lovely bottle of wine in the room (lovely fireplace as well), \"high tea\" which was this wonderful display of beautiful appetizers and tea, wine and cheese hour, which included meat, crackers, olives, cream cheese stuffed jalepenos (were to die for!), and then came the wonderful amazing GORMET breakfast/brunch in the morning. It was stunning. Everything was over the top. Organic everything, champagne, fresh squeezed orange juice, waffle station, omelet station, fruit, bread, potatoes, the most amazing carrots....oh so good. And on top of all of the wonderful food, everyone was so nice. I was treated like a princess from the moment I arrived. Oh and the room...I am particular with smells....my nose is very sensitive....but the room had such a lovely fresh clean scent to it. I loved the rainfall shower head. Bed was extremely comfortable. We would return back to this place in a heartbeat! Oh and the robes....not your typical itchy white hotel robes...these were so soft and luxurious. Loved them. The hotel seemed to get every detail right. Actually except two things: my husband and I are avid coffee lovers, and in the morning we realized they only gave us one tiny little thing of half and half, not even enough for one cup of coffee. But my husband called and they brought more up right away. The other thing that kind of bothered me was a man that worked there....Luis....he was waiting for us to leave our table after breakfast so he could clean it. He was hovering, and kept giving me dirty looks like \"come on, get moving guys!\". I felt it was rude and felt rushed, which is not good to feel on vacation. But other than those two things, the place was perfect :))", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cComfortable hotel, lovely grounds, great breakfast\u201d", "Author": "AllieAn", "ReviewID": "UR127439429", "Content": "Based on the layout i think rooms are very similar throughout the property.

The grounds are lovely as is the small pool and breakfast area. Breakfast was delicious with made-to-order eggs, many fresh fruit and vegetable dishes and Mumm champagne. There is afternoon tea with delicious scones and chocolates as well. It was too cold to use the pool, but it was a pretty, very intimate area, which I expect to be very inviting for relaxation. There is complimentary use of the Villagio spa facilities, but we did not use it. It is a 5-10 minute walk - not close enough to slip into your bath robe and use their steam room or sauna. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would return. The only downside is Yountville itself: great restaurants, but the town is developing into something close to Disneyland.

Our room was comfortably sized and well furnished with a king-size bed, fireplace, and spacious bathroom. The only oddity is the lack of any closet at all in the bedroom, with only a small armoire in the bathroom - perhaps of no moment if you are merely traveling for a few days in Napa, but less convenient if your stay is part of a longer trip, especially if you have business attire that you'd like to hang out. The \"champagne\" breakfast includes a generous and varied buffet selection, plus made to order omelet bar. Can't speak to the champagne, though, as our days were so full of wine that breakfast was the one meal that we were teetotalers. Only complaint was the inadequate amount of seating for breakfast. It was cool and rainy while we were there so the outdoor seating, which evidently accommodates many of the guests on nicer days, was not in use. There was another room on the other side of the hotel lobby for some overflow guests but it was charmless and still not sufficiently large to accommodate those who could not find seating in the main breakfast area. Also beware that the owners have at least 2 cats that roam freely in the commons area, including the upholstered furniture in the lobby and breakfast area;even if you don't see the cats, you will be aware of them, if you are highly allergic. The inn is excellently located, almost directly across the street from the French Laundry, and within a few blocks of many of Yountville's other restaurants. We had one awkward moment on our last day, when we returned to our room and found a voicemail to the effect that we had overstayed our \"two day\" reservation and therefore our 3rd night would be at the rack rate rather than the discount that we had procured from an online discount site. Fortunately we were traveling with the receipt confirmation showing our prepaid reservation for 3 nights and the hotel dropped the matter. We were never sure whether the mixup was an honest mistake or an effort of the management to extract a premium on a Saturday night when they and all the other hotels in the area were sold out.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cQuiet Place to stay - after a big meal!\u201d", "Author": "WilCorCla", "ReviewID": "UR126801562", "Content": "After 3 months of trying, we finally got a reservation with French Laundry! The reservation was 9pm. We decided we would fully (and slowly) engoy our meal - i.e. eating and drinking as much as French Laundry can offer.With that in mind, we decided to find a place so we can stay the night after the big meal. That's where Vintage Inn came in. Since our mind was set on French Laundry, we didn't really pay much attention to where we stayed. We checked the Vintage Inn website, and saw that it had good, spacious room & looked clean so we booked it. Vintage Inn was only a stone throw away from French Laundry which made it an ideal place for us. The room price was very reasonable. We checked in the room around 7pm. The front-desk folks were extremely helpful and friendly. There was a bottle of cold/chilled white wine waiting for us. The room was clean, big, and very comfortable. The bath room has a jacuzzi & very big. We were able to rest up a bit before getting ready for our big meal. We did have a great time eating in FL (who won't?). We came back to the hotel too stuff to do anything. The next day, we were planning to skip the breakfast; and we were glad we didn't. Vintage Inn offered a very nice and \"big\" breakfast with lots of fresh fruits. They also had a chef there to make omelette the way you want. Everything was very delicious. We ended up eating more than we should while still digesting the food from last night. The Inn also offers free afternoon tea, Even though we missed the afternoon tea on the day of the arrival; the front desk folks told me to come back to try after we checked out. We didn't do that because we were already re-stuffed in the nearby Bouchon Bakery. All in all - No regrets - gained at least 5 lbs.

Nevertheless, this was one of the most relaxing places I have stayed at in a long time. Charming touches like the fireplaces and complimentary logs, the jet tub, champagne brunch, afternoon tea, resident cats, etc. add to the experience. While being near the highway does take away from the otherwise rural setting, it is very convenient, as many of the restaurants and wineries are a ways away from Yountville and each other. Additionally, staying in Yountville allows you to walk to many terrific restaurants including French Laundry, Bouchon and Redd, though Yountville is not as lively or historic as downtown St Helena or Healdsburg.

They have added an omlet bar since I was last there but with all the other offerings we did not make it there. They added an afternoon tea which is very good w small sandwiches and deserts. You most likely can tell that I am into food. All too true. Yountville is the home of the top rated resturant The French Laundry. With sufficient notice the hotel can get you a reservation though you may need to be flexible on the time. Back to the hotel: there is a wonderful pool and hot tub, access to a gym (neglected to ck out) and to a spa w/in walking distance. Rooms are large w fireplace, patio/deck and baths have large soaking tubs most likely w bubbles. Again, I did not try.

Our room had a fireplace as well, wine, a refrigerator, high ceilings and a great bathroom with a jacuzzi tub. The sinks were on a beautiful cabinet (furniture like, not built in). The staff was very helpful and professional. It is a beautiful, romantic place. We added to that by visiting the nearby Castello di Amorosa in Calistoga, about half hour away.

Very nice start to a Napa vacation. As others have said the morning Champagne breakfast is wonderful. The pastries (especially the bread pudding) and omelet bar are wonderful. Was not around for the afternoon tea but hear that it is wonderful too. There was always a fully stocked barrel of cold bottled water out behind the lobby. We had an upstairs king near Washington Street with a large balcony, large bathroom, Jacuzzi tub and a very nice real fire place always stocked with an artificial log. Did occasionally hear some late night rowdies but not too bad. Our friends stayed in a king near highway 29 and did complain about the road noise at night. The pool and spa area are a little run down but that would not stop me from staying there as you have access to the Villaggio Resort which is a much newer property.

We normally don't stay at places with Vintage Inn's rack rate, but a set of deals (through Vintage Inn, AMEX, and Travelocity) ended up driving down our cost substantially. That said, now that we've stayed at Vintage Inn, we would be willing to pay more than we did to stay there again. We didn't take advantage of the spa, so we can't comment on its quality, although it looked very nice on the quick walkthrough we took. With that caveat, our favorite features of the inn were the room quality and cleanliness, the concierge service, and the daily champagne brunch. The rooms were well-appointed, clean, and comfortable. They weren't extravagant, and didn't need to be. The in-room Nespresso machine was a nice feature. The linens were newer and always clean. The cleaning staff did a great job in both the morning clean-up and the evening turn-down service. Vintage Inn's concierge was wonderful. We rolled into town during high season without a single appointment booked at any winery. Christina booked four days worth of tastings, accommodating our old favorites, some new spots, and a few that she recommended. We have a pretty good handle on which Napa wines we like, but Christina pointed us to some smaller places (<1,000 cases/yr) that we had never heard of, which we loved. She booked dinners and lunches for us, which made our time there much less stressful. Starting each day's tasting at Vintage Inn's champagne brunch was wonderful. They had a terrific spread of 10-15 dishes each morning - pastries, heirloom tomatoes, cheeses, quiche, potatoes... It's impossible to leave hungry. Omelets were available each morning, with waffles as well on the weekends. Some days, we would take a late breakfast and not even eat a lunch while out tasting. The free meal to start the day really cut down on our food bill on this trip. In all, we thoroughly enjoyed our time at Vintage Inn and can't wait to return.

It is in an excellent location, walking distance to many good fine dining restaurants (Redds is our favorite) and a five minute drive to Etoile (upscale fine dining at its very best). Our first impression upon arrival was poor as the front desk offered to have a bellman meet us at our car to help with luggage. Unfortunately, we waited almost twenty minutes before deciding to schlepp our own bags to the room. Poor start, we mentioned this at check out. We declined the US Today paper and were to receive a .75 daily credit. It was not reflected on our bill. We suggest if they are not going to make the adjustment, that they do not offer the option to decline. At $400+ a day, this is not a major factor - but don't offer what you don't deliver. The room is very nice, very clean and very quiet. The second floor room had high volume ceiling with a ceiling fan. The wall unit A/C worked great. We did not use the fireplace, but it did add to the ambiance of the room. Old television was fine as we didn't use it often. The windows have shutters, must turn them up when closing at night to eliminate light from entering the room. During the daytime, the bedroom was a little dark. The outdoor patio was large and very nice, somewhat private. The bed was fluffy, great linens and pillows. The linens made it lux, yet it is a bit soft for anyone that likes a firm mattress. The bathroom is light and bright, with a large whirlpool tub (good size for one tall person, but a bit too small for a couple). It is a tub/shower combo. The showerhead worked fine but the way the water came out, we suggest a new showerhead be purchased. We especially enjoyed the double sinks. The amenities were very nice. The towels were fluffy and in great shape. Housekeeping is excellent here. The bed is well made, crisp. We especially loved that the sheets stayed in place and always looked freshly made. The bathroom was spotless although we suggest a bit of Tilex cleaner be used inside the window tiles to eliminate the mold that is accummulating from the shower spray hitting inside. A detail that should get as much attention during cleaning as the rest of the bathroom did. No mold anywhere else, so why not make that window part of the cleaning process. The breakfast provided is excellent. Fresh juice, champagne if you wish, were always available. The omelets were good, both regular or egg white only were offered, and a nice variety of items to add to the eggs. Breakfast potatoes were available, however no breakfast meats such as sausage or bacon. A cold cut of some sort was on the table. The breakfast breads were fresh, with butter, cream cheese and a lox spread. Hot oatmeal, granola, one type of cereal and fresh fruits. Green bean salad, tomato salad and a hot item were included. Overall, something for everyone. The display was well maintained and the area clean. The tables setting inside was very nice and there is an outdoor area as well. Both areas maintained by the staff, clean and inviting. A small bar offers drinks for purchase. A bucket of ice is stocked with complimentary water bottles. Afternoon tea is excellent, a nice snack of savory and sweet items offered. Complimentary tea, iced tea and lemonade as well as bottled waters are available. The bar is open all day if you wish to purchase an alcoholic beverage. Overall, both couples agreed that we would return to this hotel. Our favorite nearby restaurant was Redd. Others we liked were Bistro Jeanty, Bouchon and Ad Hoc. Etiole at Domaine Chandon is a staple for every visit we make - it is the best dining in Yountville and was awarded one Michelin star. We drove twenty minutes to LaToque at the Westin which was also an excellent meal. Bottega, next to the hotel, was touristy and unimpressive - we would not go back to Bottega.

As people have mentioned, there was free flowing champagne and made to order bloody marys and coffee drinks. We did not make it to tea, but it seemed like drinks and fruit were always available as well. I do need to mention one negative. I was travelling with a friend and we had very specifically requested a room with two beds. We were assigned a room with only one king, and because the hotel was full during our stay, they were not able to give us the correct room type.

In addition to Soo, the Catering Manager, Tom Stokey was also extraordinary. Our wedding ceremony and reception took place at the Groezinger Estate (also owned by Villagio). It was flawless and we know Tom played an important hand in it. He did the most generous thing for us after finding out that we decided to forgo floral centerpieces to keep costs down...he picked roses from his own personal garden and created the most breathtaking petal puddles in the center of the dinner tables. They were absolutely exquisite. Actions like these speak volumes to the caliber of staff employed by the Vintage Inn.

Television reception (I know, shame on me for turning it on at all, but...) on some of the primary network channels was extremely snowy - which we were told was a function of less-than-ideal cable service on the Property. We also had a lamp on our nightstand that periodically flickered and a clock/radio/cd player that wouldn't play cds. Finally, internet wi-fi connectivity was intermittent at best and speed draggingly slow. We raised most of these matters with the Front Desk and they were prompt in checking into them - but ultimately, they weren't able to resolve the TV reception situation, internet speed or the mysteriously intermittent flickering lamp.

It was small and looked like any old chain hotel room. The decor felt very outdated and just old in general. The bathroom was nice though, with a huge jacuzzi tub and L'Occitane bath products. The room itself is not worth the money, but I'll tell you what IS worth the money. The service. They leave you a complimentary bottle of wine in your room upon check-in, which i thought was a great touch. They also offer a complimentary champagne brunch, which was plentiful and delicious. Made-to-order waffles, omelettes, and huge displays of pastries, breads, fruit, juices, coffee, sweets. My fiance and I spent one day by the pool, and an employee made several rounds offering drinks and extra treats like a bowl of cold raspberries and sunglass cleaner wipes. We also enjoyed the afternoon tea and sandwiches in the lobby. And it should be noted that the property itself is truly gorgeous. Lots of greenery, pretty fountains.

The free wine tasting at Napa Style was great. I appreciated that the inn does not nickel and dime you -- I've paid much more for hotels that charge for water and coffee. In terms of complaints about flat screen TVs and similar items, I think you need to go to a different class of hotel for those amenities.

A few tips regarding Yountville: (1) we loved Bottega and Mustard's, thought Hurleys and Pacific Blue were more than adequate. I think Bouchon and the bakery are over-rated; (2) we rented bikes from the bike company up the street instead of the hotel, in case we needed road side assistance.

Okay, lets have the bad news first: I was only disappointed with the somewhat dated rooms and mattress. Everything else sparkles. The rooms simply need some updating, better furniture, a firmer/better mattress, and maybe new carpeting for me to give the Vintage Inn the A+ that it so closely deserves. I read somewhere in one of the pamphlets that the Vintage Inn was built in 1985, and the sister property, the Villagio was built in 1998. Both properties somehow appear to be related to the \"V Marketplace\" which is a really neat shopping and restaurant area within walking distance. The Vintage and the Villagio share a concierge and if guests of the Vintage want spa services, it is a short walk to the Villagio spa. It all depends on your budget... if you don't want to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars on a hotel, but still want to be surrounded by luxury, beauty, services and attention to detail, then the Vintage Inn is the perfect choice. So onto the GOOD news. The Vintage Inn offers the following: *Gorgeous grounds and fountains throughout. *A beautiful, clean heated pool with great lounge chairs and pool towels. *A HOT hot-tub and iced-water with lemon slices within reach to cool you down. *A beautiful lobby with a fire place that's on to warm you up even at 7am. *Gormet breakfast spread included in the price, complete with champagne for mimosas and a chef making made-to-order omlettes. *Tea-time from 3-5 with delicious pastries and finger sandwiches, also included in the price. *Beautiful bathrooms in the rooms, with a great tub. *The rooms include a fireplace, patio, espresso machine, bottle of wine, refrigerator, excellent sheets and comfortor, umbrella, and daily newspapers. One more important note... the location. Yountville is a tiny but gorgeous town with world-class restaurants and several tasting rooms within walking distance. This means, no drinking and driving... everyone in your party can enjoy! The town itself is so clean and pretty, it's almost like a movie set. It's unreal to step out your front door to see the gorgeous vine-covered hills and mountains, and a colorful hot-air balloon taking off. I definitely recommend staying away from the town of Napa itself. I drove through it just to see what it's all about... I got stuck in traffic, there were city busses and school busses racing down the streets, my stress level automatically returned! It melted away and I literally sighed with relief when I returned to the Vintage Inn in Yountville! I definitely recommend the Vintage Inn.

I really felt as if I was living in this wonderful French country world. The swimming pool is quite nice too, and they must heat it, as I saw people in it in several occasions, and it wasn't terribly warm (upper 60s and 70s). I did not make use of the spa, but you can use the aromatherapy steam room and sauna as part of your stay.

I cannot say one bad thing about this place.

It was a very pleasant experience and we decided to return to the Vintage Inn in 2008. Again, we had a very pleasant experience and love the central valley location. Besides being a very pretty property, the Vintage is located in Yountville, a beautiful village in the center of Napa Valley. At the Vintage, you are within walking distance of a number of very good restaurants, including the renowned French Laundry. You can also walk to the local grocery store and prepare your own picnic or have the Inn prepare one for you (I don't recommend the Oakville Grocery during peak season. Much too crowded!!). The Vintage breakfast in the main lobby is excellent as well as the afternoon tea. The staff has always been very helpful, including the conceirge service. A couple of pointers regarding booking a room: Ask for an interior room away from the side of the property closest to Hwy 29. If you stay in a room on the Hwy 29 side, the road noise does bother some people. The upstairs rooms cost more but I believe they are worth the difference with the spacious vaulted ceilings. The rooms and property are in the French Country style and decor. Besides being in the heart of Napa Valley with easy access to the wineries, I recommend bicycling and ballooning for fun excursions. I find renting a bicycle on my own and setting my own agenda to be more fun than the confines of a group bike excursion. Napa Valley Balloons launches from Washington Square which is just up the street from the Vintage and we had a fun experience with them. If you are set on ballooning over Napa, let them know when you book that you only want to go if the weather allows them to balloon over Napa Valley. Otherwise, you could get up early for a 6am pickup, travel to the gathering site in Napa City, only to learn that, due to weather, an alternate site has been chosen outside of the valley. The breakfast after was nothing special. I would recommend skipping the breakfast and returning to the Vintage Inn for their breakfast.

The bathroom was nice with l'occitane products, although I found it odd that the armoire was in the bathroom and it was the only place in the room to hang your clothes.

Noise from the street was not really an issue, except for the construction being done on the grounds during our stay (early in the morning, argh!). The rooms are pretty expensive, but we were able to get a discount since we stayed during the week. I paid a little more for the upstairs room since I had read in previous reviews that you could hear noise from upstairs if you had a downstairs room. We took advantage of the free breakfast which was great and included made-to-order omelettes and champagne. Although one morning I walked across the street to Bouchon Bakery to get some baked goods (so delicious). I really do love the location of this hotel as it is right across the street from many great restaurants such as Bouchon and Redd.

My husband and I booked a night here mainly because I had read it was walking distance to the French Laundry and we wanted to be able to walk home after our 12 course dinner. But after reading more and more about the hotel, I was really excited to spend some time at the property itself despite the quite visit. We checked in just in time to enjoy the afternoon tea, which could be a meal in itself. Beautiful spread of tea sandwiches, pastries, etc. They gave us glasses of champagne when we checked in also which was a nice surprise, I have only had this at one other hotel, the very upscale Rittenhouse in Philadelphia, and it is always a welcome touch. After tea we enjoyed a lovely walk around the well-manicured grounds of the hotel, I loved the little man-made stream that runs through the grounds, and the pool looked clean & lovely. Our room did not disappoint - clean, very French countryside, and huge! I agree with the others that in a bottom floor room you will definitely your upstairs neighbors. I was a little annoyed at this, but then again I did pay the cheaper downstairs rate since we were splurging for the French Laundry. If I visit again I will most definitely pay for the upstairs room. The traffic did not bother me too much, but do request a room away from RT. 29. The town is lovely and the hotel is well situated to visit any of the restaurants and the staff was very pleasant. We appreciated the bottle of wine in our room although we didn't even have a chance to drink it during our stay! The breakfast buffet was also great - lots of light options as well as omelette bar. And free flowing Mumm champagne for mimosas - lovely touch for wine country - although be careful if you are moving on for a day of wine tasting! I would highly recommend staying here - well worth the weeknight online rate we paid due to the location and amenities. I would love to go back and check out the other restaurants in town. The French Laundry is a once in a lifetime experience and I would recommend it if you can afford the splurge. My husband and I felt like we had been to similar restaurant experiences on the East Coast - especially in DC at Cityzen where a former French Laundry sous chef runs the kitchen. But the service was impeccable and we felt like we were the only table in the place all night.

Instead, they upgraded us to an inner perimeter room in the courtyard, which made for a much quieter visit. The room was very large with a very comfortable King-sized bed, a small table and chairs, two bedside tables, window seat, and reading chair. There is no built in closet, but there was a beautiful amoire with ample hanging space, hangers, and shelves. The bathroom is very large, with two sinks and a large tub/shower. The bathroom amenities are from L'Occitane, which I loved. The food was extremely good. Breakfast is served with a full array of pastries, eggs, potatoes, cheese, meats, fruit, yogurt, and granola. Also, there is sparkling wine each morning. Later in the day, tea and coffee are available with a large assortment of scones, little sandwiches, and pastries. One could eat the large breakfast, skip lunch, have tea, then go to dinner. Very economical. The service was excellent. Each and every person I met was lovely, and went out of their way to accommodate us. All of the rooms have fire places, and when we needed more Duraflame logs, they were happy to oblige. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a very comfortable stay in Napa. It is within walking distance to the French Laundry, Bistro Jeanty, Hurley's, Bouchon, and Redd.

Our room was very large, on the upper level, with shuttered windows that open and a nice balcony with plenty of room. The bathroom was huge, witha very nice Jacuzzi tub. However, the decor of the room was nowhere near luxurious - cheap sheets that didn't fit the bed, hideous industrial grey carpeting, miniscule table lurking awkwardly in one corner. The bed was comfortable but saggy. The bathroom smelled faintly of mildew. The construction of the place does not appear to be very solid. The air conditioning unit rattled loudly whenever it was on - luckily it was not warm enough for us to need it. No matter how quietly we tried to walk, it sounded like we were stomping back and forth. I felt sorry for whoever was in the downstairs room. The room came with a free bottle of local semi-decent Chardonnay, which might have been a nice touch, except that we don't drink - we would rather have had fruit or some other kind of snack. The entire experience would have been fine except that we were paying $600/night for the room. Having just paid less than half that to stay at the Ritz in San Francisco, I felt robbed.

The tea was just right to hold us over until dinner and the breakfast was far nicer than we expected! It had hot and cold items -- everything from scrambled eggs to meats to fresh cut fruit and pastries to juices. And even a respectable Mumm champagne!
