We never did read reviews for this one, but we read reviews for the Candy Hostel and people were saying how much better THIS ONE is compared to the Candy. So we thought we'd give it a shot. We had to make a 60 dollar deposit and when we got there, the price was a LOT higher than what the website gave us. We had a hard time finding the place and when we walked into the lobby we thought it looked alright. WRONG -the staff was very unfriendly and unhelpful -the elevator trapped us for 2 minutes....scared us to DEATH -we thought we'd have two beds...we walked into the room and just stood there with our mouths hanging open. -ONE bed. - a cheap floor fan (and it was August so it was still hot outside). - a rip off tv that only got one fuzzy new york channel. -one big mirror. -two outlets for two people who had cell phones, ipods, etc. -and we had TONS of luggage so we had to crawl over our stuff and almost broke our necks. Overall, the room was as big as a closet. There was no where to take out the trash so we had to use plastic bags and we were there for a week so it started to smell with our beyond overflowing trash. I have nightmares of that place because it had eerie lighting and spooky halls. The kitchens were discusting-bring your own kitchen gear. The bathrooms were decent surprisingly but I would recemmond bringing your own towels, bath essentials and flip flops. The window in the bathroom did not shut. The sheets and pillows seem clean BUT I wound up at Immediate Care when I got home because I either broke out from the detergent in the sheets or bed bug bites (but my friend didn't have any problems so I don't know). I only slept and took a shower (which I recommend doing in the afternoon before seeing a musical or going out for the night because no one is around) and high-tailed it out of there. This place is ALRIGHT if you plan on staying for one night but just to sleep. My friend was doing a camp so I was sight-seeing, shopping and spending time with a friend who was in a musical and dreaded coming back to the room. The location is alright.

Every surface of the halls, bedroom, communal bathroom, and kitchen area were filthy in addition to being tiny, old, and broken down. I made the mistake of leaving my shower shoes at home, so I tied plastic grocery bags around my feet so that they didn't come in contact with anything when I was showering and getting dressed -- it was that bad. Maybe I was there on a bad day or something, but I just can't even convey how grimy everything was. There also weren't nearly enough bathrooms, so you had to fight a crowd just to get to the shower. Half the lights didn't seem to be working, so everything was just barely lit -- which I guess just helped to camouflage the dirt. I know you get what you pay for, and it was super cheap by NYC standards, but I still blame the West Side Inn for having a totally misleading web site.

Sadly, however, that is about all this place has going for it. I stayed at the West Side Inn for two weeks, checking out over the weekend to go and stay with friends up north. Over the first week, I had very few problems. The room I was given was clean, although a little smelly, had a private toilet and sink so I only had to use the shared bathroom to shower in, and even had an air conditioner. However, on my return after the weekend, I was greeted by rude staff at the front desk, a broken elevator which meant I had to carry my suitcase up four flights of stairs to a room which was directly above the one I had been in the previous week. Considering I had paid exactly the same for the accommodation for the second week, it seemed sensible of me to assume I would get the same quality of room. Disappointingly, this was not so. The room, as mentioned, was a further flight of stairs up. It had an even greater stench than the one downstairs. The room had no air conditioner, let alone a fan during the hot New York summer. Other elements of this hotel that should be known by those planning to visit are that it advertises televisions in its rooms, but they do not work. You have to pay to use the internet on the computers provided by the hotel, but surrounding ones have free wifi that you can link into if you have a laptop with you. There are very few power outlets in the rooms to charge cameras, etc (I had to unplug the tv to do so in my second room). The thing that I disliked the most about this hotel was their check-in policy, which requires you to provide proof of transportation into the city. If, like me, you plan to leave and then return to the hotel, make sure you use public transport that provides you with a printout. Unfortunately, if you have amazing friends like me that want to pick you up and collect you from outside of the city, therefore not using public transport, you are pretty much screwed!

Initially when we arrive it looked okay from outside, when we entered the receptionist wasn't the friendliest & had made matters of our reservation rather confusing. We ended up in a room with a bunk instead of the double bed we had booked for. We took one look at the lift & decided we'd rather take the stairs. Being on the 3rd floor it wasn't too bad - however taking our luggage up aswell - was very tiring! We walked into our corridor & again everything seemed okay - the moment we entered the room both myself & friend were speechless. It was no bigger than a box room - again we weren't expecting much as we knew it was cheap - but we WERE expecting a bit more than what was there. The door had one lock on & didn't look very secure - the door itself had a good inch gap between the top of the door & the frame & there was one very dirty window. There was a single curtain which was just about attached to the pole, and i dont think we opened or closed it during our stay. There was 2 plug sockets [one that didnt work] a TV, & the bunk beds. I think the Tv was the only thing that kept us sane - we left it on all night so it blocked any outside noise & kept us occupied from this box we were staying in. The beds themselves did have clean sheets but only 1 single pillow which wasn't much bigger or thicker than a regular paper-back book. The matresses were also very thin so the beds weren't fantastic - however it was a place to put your head down. Our room was right next to the bathroom which had its ups and downs. As the walls are so paper thin you could hear everything going on in the corridor & the bathroom - but as we were sharing the bathroom it meant we generally didn't have to wait very long to use it. However the room was clean - so if your not fussed about size/comfiness & partially security then it was fine! The bathroom floor was ALWAYS soaking, and again was very tiny. However the toilet & bath/shower did always appear to be clean. I'm glad we never used the lift as it broke down at least 3 times during out stay. After the first few nights we began to get used to it but did move to a different hotel - which was incredible! So in the end we only stayed for 4 nights here [so the lift broke down at least 3 times in 4 days!] The lobby is the only thing thats pictured on the website i think & i'm not suprised why - it gives a very false impression to what it is really like. The internet however was very cheap $2 for 20mins i think & did work quite fast. It was about 5minute walk away from the subway - which was ideal. & wasn't that bad walking bad very late at night - however we didn't mope we did quick march back. The area itself was quite pleasant but we didnt really spend alot of time checking out what was there. Overall if you only want somewhere to put your head down - this place is fine.

We were visiting from Los Angeles, California, and this was our first time in the city (as adults). Neither of us are very picky when it comes to living situations. After reading the reviews here, I was a bit skeptical but we figured we'd save money (and stay the rest of our vacation with friends who live in Williamsburg). We figured it'd be a lot like camping. In preparation for our stay, and based on some of the reviews, I brought our own towels and bed linens along with us. Neither of them were necessary as the ones provided were clean (although quite cheaply made). Our room was on the 5th floor. The elevator worked sporadically so it was necessary to take the stairs on a few occasions. Many of the stairs are in disrepair! While neither my boyfriend nor I have any physical disabilities, I would not recommend this hotel for people with physical handicaps as it is clearly not compliant with accessibility regulations. The room contained a bed, a chest of drawers, a television w/stand, a closet, and a big oscillating fan (which was very handy). The window opened, and heat was never an issue for us. The temperature in the room was pleasant throughout our stay. The bathrooms were a different story. Our first visit to the bathroom was a bit shocking: there was incredibly filthy toilet, and overflowing trash bin with bloody feminine products & tissues (sorry to be gross, but this is the truth). The floor was wet and a bit muddy. The smell was disgusting and akin to an outdoor toilet/portable one. (In fact, I've been in cleaner public toilets than this one!) We decided to use another floor for our trips to the bathroom -- none of which, of course were by any stretch clean or \"nice\". The shower pressure was low, which makes removing soap very difficult, coupled with the fact that the temperature was difficult to control. During one of my showers & a time when my boyfriend showered as well, the head/nozzle shot off! It was difficult getting it back on -- especially with water flying everywhere! The bathrooms were indeed the low point of the stay. We made it a habit to use bathroom facilities BEFORE heading back to the hotel so as to limit our use of the hotel toilets. Another matter was the smell. The hallways smelled of cat urine. It was very strong! Our room did not smell, but I had purchased perfumed candles anyway to burn while we were in the room. This was a great idea -- and I strongly recommend it! There was another issue of noise. While none of the other guest made noise, the hotel staff & workers made it nearly impossible for me to sleep! They were re-tiling the bathroom on our floor and the noise began at 7am and did not let up. The maids slammed doors & spoke loudly in the hallway. I encourage you to purchase earplugs should you choose to stay here and are a light sleeper. They came in handy for me the second & third night there. I do not regret staying here. It was very inexpensive, although there could be many improvements. My boyfriend & I now have some \"great\" stories to tell of this place as it was certainly memorable, and funny looking back on it. I do not think I would stay here again, but do recommend it for those who know what they are getting into. We spent little time here, and would encourage it for singles or couples who plan on sight-seeing or being away most of the day/evening hours. The location is great for walking, with a few good restaurants & grocery markets nearby -- not to mention Central Park is only a few blocks up the street. The public transportation from this location is fantastic! Subway is close by & easily accessible. I would grade this hotel a \"C\", mainly due to its convenience to the city. It certainly is not up to regulation both in health standards & handicap accessibility regulations, but if you know what to expect, it is great for a cheap place to spend a few nights.

It was listed as a two star hotel so we weren't expecting anything fancy, just a place to sleep at night after looking at apartments all day long. The location was perfect for our apartment hunting, but that turned out to be the only thing that was perfect. The lobby needs a little TLC but is gorgeous. Don't believe it. It's the only part of the hotel that looks remotely good. The rest of the building looks and feels like something out of a 70's era ghetto crime movie, with tiny rooms, cramped hallways, and decaying walls/carpets/ceilings/floors/plumbing... The first room we got smelled like something had died inside, and there was no light. After inching down a completely black hallway and turning a corner, I could vaguely make out a wire hanging from the only light fixture. Hoping it wasn't about to electrocute me, I grabbed it and pulled. I should have left the room dark. It was barely big enough to fit the bed and looked as bad as it smelled. No way were we staying in that room. To their credit, the hotel did give us a different room without any hassle. Maybe they're used to complaints about that room. The new room smelled fine, but didn't look any better, nor was it any bigger. The bed was uncomfortable and the sheets/blankets were of questionable cleanliness. The shared bathroom down the hall wasn't any better - bring sandals if you book here against the advice of all the reviews. Fortunately the weather was nice while we were there, I can only imagine how uncomfortable the hotel would be in the dead of winter or during a heat wave. I suppose it could have been a lot worse. We didn't encounter any bedbugs, cockroaches, or mice, and we were only looking for a place to sleep and bathe. Still, I've stayed in budget hotels/hostels/pensions in 3rd world countries that were far, far better than this dump. I could accept this kind of quality for maybe $10/night, but $100?

The guy looked at us, took our reservation paperwork, and called another hotel to see if they had any available rooms. They didn't. So he said he had one room available w/side by side twins (we booked a double). When we asked why we couldn't have the room we booked, he just got agitated and basically said take it or leave it.

We were not expecting to sleep in separate beds, but bunk beds was a little much. (this was the only weekend away w/o our two year old). The room was dingy and dirty, the bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in quite awhile, and everything smelled like smoke. The pillows felt more like a t-shirt wadded up inside a pillow case than a pillow. When we tried to call the elevator, it only came to the 4th floor, and took us to the basement instead of the 1st. We didn't ride it again. I considered staying up all night around NYC instead of sleeping in this hotel. The only good quality about this place is that we had hot showers.

Bearing this in mind, my stay was quite enjoyable, and above all, cheap. We arrived in the afternoon, having been unable to book online for that same evening, and payed twice the price per night on the online booking system. The desk clerk was very helpful however, and suggested we book out second night online using the hostel's computers. The room was a private double, and though tiny, was about what we had expected. There was a bed with threadbare (but clean) linens, and old tv on a bizarre makeshift shelf, and a window. The window opened thank goodness, because the radiator was blasting. The tv reception was poor, but the bed was comfortable. The shared bathroom situation was not as bad as I thought, there were two to each floor (that I noticed, there may have been more) and they were kept very clean, the cleaning staff were in there each morning before 10. The location was super, very easy to find and a quick walk from the 103rd Street Subway station (on the number 1 red line train, which runs right through the heart of Manhattan to South Ferry). There were several bakeries within 2 blocks, along with a couple of pharmacies, a supermarket, a green grocer, and lots of other shops. The location was great for grabbing breakfast in the morning before heading out for the day. The hostel also has a left luggage facility, in the form of electronic lockers. These are located down the wrought iron stairs to the right of the building, and were a godsend for us before the flight home, no sense in dragging all of that luggage around. It cost $5.00 for 24 hours, but beware, you cannot reopen the lockers without having to pay another $5.00 to lock it again, we learned that the hard way. Though we were using the West Side Inn more as a cheap hotel than a hostel, it didn't seem like a fun place to stay if of itself for travelers. There was a small computer room and lounge type room by the front desk, but that was it. If you want a cozy, fun place to stay while travelling I would not recommend this hostel, but if you are more concerned about a cheap place to sleep in New York City that isn't out in the boondocks, than I would highly recommend staying at the West Side Inn.

Make no mistake about it, this was the only thing I needed and so I booked a room for myself and my partner so we could travel the 3500 miles from the UK and see the sights of New York. A not surprising amount of review space has been given to just how unorganized this hostel is. My own experience was one of booking a month in advance, emailing them immediately after booking to inform them that I would be arriving late (10pm), emailing them again a week before departure and again on the day of departure to remind them of my late arrival and still arriving at 10pm to find they had no rooms left at all. That is not to say that alternative accomodation was not provided but after 11 hours of flying, trying to find the hotel in an unfamiliar city and carrying two large suitcases I was expected to walk for 30 minutes, late at night and through uptown New York to find a hotel whose address they had scribbled onto the back of a business card. Further to this, when I finally arrived at the alternate hotel they had not received information regarding the room transfer. After booking and paying for a double room in a hostel 'steps away from' Central Park, we were given a cupboard of a room with bunk beds miles away from anything. Needless to say the pictures of the hotel are not actually of the hotel and are extremely misleading. But this doesn't matter, because like hundreds of other reviewers I never got to stay there because after taking my booking they simply gave my room away despite sending them 3 emails in advance, none of which received a reply. My advise to fellow travellers would be to book somewhere else if you want any kind of guarantee that you will have a room to sleep in when you arrive. I can only think myself lucky that one of the four hotels the receptionist at the West Side phoned had a free room for the nights we were staying as I can't imagine any assistance would have been offered had this not been the case. No apologies were offered and the casual way we were told we would 'just have to stay somewhere else' combined with the number of travellers who have had similar experiences suggests this is regular occurance at the West Side Inn.

They consisted of working plugs comfy beds with clean sheets. Not all beds had thick covers so if you cant sleep with out i suggest you take a sleeping bag or something similar. The bathrooms were ok they had hot water, which was clean no brown gunk or anything like that. Other rooms consisted of just bunkbeds, but again u are paying for a bed and shelter.

I couldn't fit my body into it, maybe a child or very skinny person could. My friend, larger than me, certainly couldn't shower either. When I used the toilet, it overflowed everywhere.

Firstly, it is a hostel, not hotel (despite what they may claim) and as long as you bear that in mind you should have few problems. My boyfriend and I were on a very small budget as students and $70 dollars per night per room was all we could stretch to. We were very put off staying at the West Side Inn after reading the other reviews here but we desperately wanted to visit New York and figured that we wouldn't be spending that much time in the room anyway what with all the sightseeing and shopping we had planned, so decided to risk it. And I am so glad we took that risk! We arrived in the early hours of the morning several hours later than we'd told the Inn we would so they had given our room away but they paid for us to get to another hostel nearby and we were able to return to the West Side Inn the following day, also at their expense. This was probably the most negative part of our stay with regards to the hostel. Ok so it was a bit inconvenient having to unpack stuff only to pack it all away again the next day, but we were so tired we were just glad of somewhere to stay. You do have to pay for your entire stay upfront, in cash. We asked to see our room first (and also checked out the bathrooms) to avoid paying for a week in a room we might've left the next day. I recommend you do this, they didn't seem to mind and then you can always go somewhere else if you're not satisfied. The room (212) was tiny without any storage except for 4 coathangers hanging below the TV and a table, but the bedding was clean and smelt fresh. There was a big window, the lock to the door seemed pretty good and there were no problems with noise despite being next to a bathroom. There were three bathrooms on our floor and a basic kitchen, although we didn't use this at all. The room got a bit stuffy at times but there was a big fan and we were able to open the window. It is a bit of an inconvenience having to share a bathroom but we rarely had to wait and they were quite clean with high power, hot showers. The staff were friendly enough, arranged an airport transfer with Airlink for me, which is much better value than a taxi. The location is good too, just three blocks down Broadway from the nearest subway station and only a few metres down West 107th Street from Broadway so it felt safe to walk home from subway and nearby restaurants after dark. The area is pretty busy most of the time and well lit too. And of course the North end of Central Park isn't far away either and you can walk over to museums such as the Guggenheim by crossing to the East Side of the park and then down a few blocks. There's quite a few places around for breakfast and dinner too. To be honest I'm glad we didn't pay more for somewhere nicer because it wouldn't have been worth it. There is so much more to do in New York than sit in your room watching TV that we were out all day and were only in our room to sleep. If you're on a tight budget and plan on being out and about alot then I really recommend this place!

There are no electrical plug outlets in your room. Even the TV is plugged to some external socket (the power cord runs outside the room through a hole by the window). The hallways stink of smoke and are damp. I made a reservation for a two-twin-bed room for my girlfriend and her dad. When they arrived, they first gave them a room with one queen-sized bed! When they complained, they put them in a room (size about 6ft by 10ft) with pink-painted walls furnished by a two-storey twin-sized bunk bed and a non-functional TV! So, if you aren't a student who doesn't mind living in a stinky dorm room with just a bed to sleep on, this place isn't worth the money. Pay a little extra and stay in the YMCA. OR better yet, stay in Jersey City, and take the public transport to NY!", "Date": "May 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sevenoaks, Kent, UK", "Title": "\u201cFriendly, Comfortable and Clean and INEXPENSIVE\u201d", "Author": "Kalahariuk", "ReviewID": "UR7238163", "Content": "I had never visited New York before, but I had read some shocking reports about West Side Inn on this very site, so I was apprehensive at best, I brought a Sleeping bag with me, scared by thoughts of grubby sheets.

We had booked a quick \"shopping break\" to NY, and the hotel was included in the package price. Before arriving at the hotel we even looked for other places to stay in NY, but most of the hotel rooms in the city seemed to be either fully booked or in excess of $500 per night. As we knew we onyl had to stay for 3 nights we decided that we would just stau there no matter how bad it was. When we arrived at around 7:00pm after an eight hour flight from England, we were suprised at how friendly the girl on reception was. We checked in with no hassle and went straight to the room. As reported, on numerous other reports, the room was very small indeed and a little tired looking, it could certainly do with a lick of paint! The most important thing for us was that the room was very clean, we were also next door to the bathromm (which was shared with a few other rooms) and this was always very clean during our entire stay, and I don't think we ever had to wait more than a couple of minutes to use it. I presume that all the other residents were as respectful as we were, and made sure it was always left clean and tidy. The sheets and pillows on the bed are certainly a little worn, but they were clean, and could be changed every day if requested. Due to some of the reports on here, my wife and I had actually taken our own sheet and pillow cases as a precaution (we actually took a king size duvet cover, so that we could climb straight into it) The location of the hotel (which shouldn't really be called a hotel, it's more of a hostel) is absolutely fantastic, with lots of bars, coffee shops and restaranuts within a couple of minutes walk. It was really easy to get a taxi from the end of the street, straight to Times Square, 5th Avenue etc and it is only around $12-$15 each time, if you are on more of a budget, then the subway is very close by. and there are lot's of buses as well.

They also offered me another room, but I did not take it. My room was just a few inches bigger the the queen size bed and there was no closet in the room. Not even a hook or any clothes hangers. Whenever I needed something, I had to put the suitecase on the bed, take my stuff out, close it and put it back beside the bed. There was nothing in the room exept a bed, a small table next to the bed and an ancient tv without remote. The room was dirty and smelly and was not renovated or painted in ages. The linen were not clean and I used one of my t-shirts to cover the pillow for the night. It was very cold, but sometime during the night, the heater started to work and it got very hot. I could not adjust the heat level, so I had to open the window. So my head was freezing and my feet were red-hot. The radiator made cracking and fizzing noise the hole night and I feared it might explode. I did not catch any sleep and had one of the worst nights of my life.

Nothing to put your stuff like a rack or a shelf. No even a hook to hang the towel.

In short, this is easily and by far the worst hotel I have ever seen. Believe all the horrible reviews. Since checking out after 2 nights of an intended 4 night stay, I have read a lot of the other reviews on this hotel. My experience with 2 different rooms is the similar as all the horrible reviews on this website. The place was easily the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. Upon check-in, I was given a room on the first floor right by the entrance. Being exhausted from travel, I attempted to nap; however, the noise from the street (to be expected) kept me awake. I asked for a different room, and the noise was much less. In both rooms, the doors were very old and not fit properly on their hinges. They were painted over numerous times without sanding so that they were easily a half inch thicker. The doors in both rooms and to the bathrooms did not close completely and had to be secured with bars, whose screws were almost pulled out of the door. The two rooms I stayed at look absolutely nothing like the pictures on the hotel's website or on the pictures on hotel.com as of September, 2006. The only items in the room were a double bed, 2 stained towels, 2 hotel bars of soap, a fan, and a small TV. There was no remote, no phone, no night stand, no shampoo. There was no air conditioning and no closable window. The thin curtain was stained and worn. The walls were painted over as many times as the doors. There was no proper ceiling, instead just the exposed cement of the next floor above. There were exposed pipes in the one corner and across the ceiling. There was no lamp, instead only a flickering florescent light which took a minute or two to light. No cute pictures on teh wall or plants on a night stand. There was no clock or radio. The bed was wrapped in a plastic covering making it very uncomfortable; the pillows were lumpy. The sheets were stained, whether by rust, urine, or post-coital fluids I do not know. The sheets were worn thin. The comforter was way too heavy for summer without AC. The window was stuck open, and strange odors wafted in from time to time, almost like cigar smoke, yet impossible since the second room faced into another building. The bathroom floors were uneven such that the door had a 3 inch gap on the one side along the bottom. The shower doors were hard to slide open and closed. For being \"immaculately cleaned twice a day\" the bathrooms were quite dirty. The water pressure was unsteady, forcing me to constantly change the amount of hot and cold. Luckily, I did not have a problem with drainage. The toilet actually was clean, and there was always toilet paper. The bathrooms were painted bright yellow, not a cheery soft yellow, but a vibrant, bright yellow, a shade that I never thought existed in paint. The paint was new, but obviously painted over chipped and cracked layers. There were constantly puddles of water on the floor. The one toilet leaked. The steps upstairs were cracked and one had been replaced by a textured steel plate. There are some positives. Unlike some of the reviews, I saw no vermin. I was surprised not to at least get bitten by mosquitos considering the window was stuck open. Additionally, the neighboorhood is not bad at all. It's high in the upper west side, almost to morningside heights, but it was convenient to the subway and near some very good restaurants. Some of the apartments nearby looked very nice. Contrary to some reviews, there were no thugs, prostitutes, or loud partiers around. This hotel seems to be perhaps one of the last buildings in the area that has not been renovated completely. If there are indeed some rooms which look like the advertised pictures, they are not on either the first nor second floor. You could ask for a higher floor, but why would you want to leave that up to chance? Supposedly, they were full otherwise. I could not take the place. I was in town to find an apartment for a relocation. Luckily, I found someplace my second day, and so I checked out two days early and rented a car to drive back home. I am in the process of getting a refund from hotels.com for the two days I did not stay there. I have stayed in some bad hotels, and NYC is my favorite city, and yet I could not bare to spend another night in this place, even meaning that I would have to return home sooner. If you can at all afford more, try Hotel 31. It is the same set up (small rooms, shared bathrooms), but a much higher quality in an even more convenient neighborhood (Midtown, 31st). I stayed there back in April for the same price as West Side Inn and only chose West Side Inn this time because Hotel 31 had gone up $20 (probably seasonal). Trust me, get a cheaper dinner or have fewer drinks or take the subway instead of a cab or something to save an extra $20 and stay there or someplace else. Really, I cannot image someplace worse. Upon waking up sweaty the one morning, I looked at my friend and remarked that I felt like I was in a movie where I was holed up somewhere on the lam.

My friend and I didn't have an issue with the staff; we checked in and out hassle-free. The lobby is a little misleading. Gold paint, chandeliers, and leather seats make you assume the rest of the place looks like that. Wrong! Our room was on the 6th floor, and we were casually informed that the elevator didn't go to the 6th floor...it stopped at the 5th. This wouldn't be such a hassle if we didn't have tons of luggage to drag up the narrow, dim stairwell. The first thing we noticed about our room was the door. It had been painted over so many times that the doorknob and doorjam were nonfunctioning. It was locked with a deadbolt and had to be pushed open. When we walked in, we were immediately assaulted with the pungent odor of cat urine. It was a little bizarre, as there were no cats in sight (we hope). We got used to the smell eventually, but each time we came back to the room after a night out it hit us all over again. The sink in the room dispensed water with a chalky color, so we didn't bother using it. The furniture was the very minimum. I didn't mind the aesthetics of the room, but the mattress (supposedly a double, but seemed like a single with two pillows) was so old that we practically sank into it. It was nearly floor-level when both of us layed on it. The sheets were bare, and we were cold at night, but that was alleviated by wearing sweatshirts to bed. The radiator worked, but went on at sporradic intervals. The bathroom was a different story. The shower was clogged, so within three minutes of being in it the water was up to my shins. I only showered twice on a five-day trip because it was such an ordeal. Hot water was scarce. The bottom of the tub was full of debris (soap scum, other people's hair, etc.) Quite gross, but you gotta do what you gotta do. Our floor seemed deserted, despite overhearing that the place was fully booked. The residents were quiet, save the hum of some televisions. I did pass by a few open rooms and noticed that many were much nicer than ours. Not all of the rooms in this place were like ours, but then again, not all of them will be like the pictures on the web site, either. It's hit or miss. Be careful and if you can, ask to see your room before you hand over any money. And finally, the neighborhood. I was mildly familiar with Manhattan before the trip, and the neighborhood is in an area called Morningside Heights, which is right below Harlem. During the day it's like any other place, but at night we were several times approaced by people looking for money. There were some shady looking characters hanging out on the streets, which were all but empty once the sun went down. It's not too dangerous, but if you are coming back to the place after a night out, I recommend taking the subway to 103 and Central Park West and then getting a cab for the remaining blocks (only a few bucks). Seems paranoid, but tourists are easy to pick out in a neighborhood like that. Be careful, travel in groups (especially if you're a woman...hate to say it, but it's better to be safe than sorry), try not to dress too \"touristy\"--(backpacks, visible cameras, etc.). We didn't have any major incidents with the people in the neighborhood, but when the sun goes down it definitely gives off a very creepy vibe. You can make the decision for yourselves based on my review. If you're on a budget, go for it, but if you can afford a better place, I'd spring for it. I woke up with some mysterious bites on my skin on more than one occassion, and now (finally at home), am feeling pretty itchy.

They were very much wanting to make our stay comfortable. We were taken to our room which was on the fourth floor. The room was small and there was paint that was peeled off the wall, but there was a TV, a bed, and a window. What more do you want when you are going to be out seeing the city all day long. It did take a little coaching for myself to use the shared bath, but it was not that bad at all. Everyone was very respectful about not taking too long in the showers and making sure they left the bathroom decent when they were finished. The hotel is in an awesome location. It is a 2 min walk from the 1 and 9 train and there is also a nice pub just around the corner. The upper west side is beautiful, and West Side Inn is right in the center of it. If you are looking for an inexpensive room just to lay your head for a few hours before heading out again to see the city then west side is a great hotel for your stay.
