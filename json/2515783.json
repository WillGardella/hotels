Location is off the main strip casino area. There are no shuttle, we had our car so we could park in any casino for free when we did go to the casino strip. Overnight parking here at the Residence inn is free. Rooms: The rooms were about average, the is a small kitchen, couch, bathroom all in one room. This is a residence inn. The carpet and decor are horrendous and bland. Lobby: The lobby area seemed nice, the breakfast in the morning is plenty. They had waffles, yogurt, cereal, coffee, juices, fruits etc. Enough seating for a family and friends. Pool Area: This is a small area for going swimming. But who goes to vegas to swim? Gym: They do have a small gym with the cardio machines and free weights. Overall I would stay here again just because I prefer quietness from the havoc from the strip. Parking area: They have plenty of parking. On one night the main area was all packed, we parked in the back area, there are 2 levels of parking which we were able to see from our room.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "salt lake city", "Title": "\u201cAverage Hotel\u201d", "Author": "dleaver", "ReviewID": "UR127352979", "Content": "Very average hotel, decent location, close to many eating places, shopping, airport, strip.

Our stay at the Residence Inn Marriott in Hughes center was comfortable and quite. The Suites are furnished with a good sized kitchen the size of which would be similar to a small apartment. The kitchen has a full fridge, microwave and silverware. Behind the Front Desk you will find a mini convenience center with snacks, beverages and frozen entrees that can be cooked in your room. The hotel lobby is geared well for the business traveler with a large flat screen usually tuned to National news a stack of News papers and ample seating. The morning Breakfast buffet was well supplied and regularly topped off. A stop in to the gym found a great dumbbell rack and several high end elliptical and treadmill machines. The pool area is nicely configured for resting and relaxation, but the building placement keeps the sun away until around 4pm. This might not be bad during the high summer months, but we were there in April, and really would have liked more sun exposure for our brief poolside stint. Since I am an early riser, and my wife is a late sleeper establishments like the Residence Inn Marriott in Hughes Center cater to my\" get up and go\" mentality allowing my wife some quite time. I can leave the room for a nice breakfast, hit the gym and then return to the room later with coffee and a muffin for my lovely wife!!", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, VA", "Title": "\u201cNice, clean hotel\u201d", "Author": "khotze", "ReviewID": "UR127097936", "Content": "Our flight was canceled and we were stuck in Vegas for an extra night -- and every hotel on the strip was sold out!

My room had 2 queen beds & the smallest kitchenette i've seen in a Residence Inn. The pub style table was so small that I couldn't imagine 2 people actually eating at it. The higher-style chairs would not be comfortable for senior citizens. There was an old style clock radio that was unreliable so I just used my cellphone. (No MP3 connectivity like in other RIs. Only 1 light between the beds so any reading would disturb the other occupant. Desk was on top of bed, which was on top of outdated dresser to which the flatscreen Tv wad bolted.

The hotel last had a major renovation done in the summer of 2005. They now have 42\" LG plasma TVs in the living/kitchen areas and 37\" plasma TVs in the bedrooms. However, they still have the same analog cable/satellite system resulting in a sub-par picture on a 42\u201d set. It looks like they have done some touch-up repainting of the walls in the rooms. The carpet in our 1-bedroom unit and the hallways was in excellent shape even after almost 5 years. 1. There are no bed bugs. 2. They only have the evening reception on Monday and Tuesdays with one on alternating Wednesday as was the case last year. Breakfasts could be a little chaotic, they sometimes would almost run out of bagels and you would have to ask them to replenish these. They have the same food selections every morning. They apparently have less staff than in our previous visits there. Coffee service is only available in the mornings and those evenings when there is the reception. 3. They have replaced all the room thermostats with a new energy saving SensorStat system with a wall mounted wireless thermostat, an infrared (IR) motion detector in each room of a unit and a wireless door entry sensing switch. These thermostats automatically switch between heating and cooling depending on the room temperature. They have taken away the ability to fully control the temperature in the room, the air flow, and to choose between heating and cooling. The two computers and printers in the Hearth Room are getting a little old and need replacing. Overall the Residence Inn at the Hughes center still offers one of the best values and locations in Las Vegas, especially if you are going to be there for at least 5 or more nights.", "Date": "April 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edgewater, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cLocation good, Breakfast good, Rooms so so\u201d", "Author": "Phillyexp", "ReviewID": "UR60726283", "Content": "Stayed there for 3 nights.

The rooms are standard Residence Inn suites (nice and familiar to me). However, the hotel is much taller than most Residence Inn hotels and thus you are likely to have a good view from your room. I had a great view of the mountain ranges in the distance - beautiful. The breakfast was the standard Residence Inn breakfast, with waffles, eggs, biscuits and gravy, sausage, yogurt, cereals, toast, coffee, juices, etc... My only complaint is that they keep leaving you messages asking you to join the Holiday Club, which I presume is a timeshare or something. I wouldn't expect to be bothered like that at a Residence Inn. I may have given 5 stars were it not for this. One other thing, there is covered garage parking, which protects from the fierce desert sun (I visited in December so covered parking wasn't really a necessity.) If I were visiting Vegas on vacation, there is no way I'd stay here, but for work it's perfectly suitable. It's too far from the strip that you need a car or need to cab it. Fortunately, there are plenty of cabs waiting right in front of the hotel at all hours ready to take you places.

We had to use a knife to slit the package. 2) Upon receipt of our credit card statement, there were two separate $3 charges. I called the hotel to inquire and was told they were for bottled water. We did not use any of the bottled water, as we had brought our own supply for use in our car on the long daily drives.
