The hotel is quick and scenic walk from the Bell Harbor Conference Center. The service was impeccable - everyone on the hotel staff was super friendly and helpful. I was also able to check-in early, which I greatly appreciated since I arrived in Seattle in the early afternoon. The city view room I had was spacious and clean, the lighting was bright and sufficient for a woman doing makeup and hair -- although one of the main lights over the mirror died during my stay and housekeeping didn't notice/fix it. I also liked the high-end toiletries that were available. The turn-down service with Seattle chocolates was a nice touch. The king size bed I had was super comfy. The only gripe I have with the whole hotel (really!) is with the pillows: they are feather and way too soft. No neck or head support whatsoever. Luckily, I asked if they had any others and was provided with memory-foam pillows right away! This is especially awesome for me since this is what I have at home. Room service was amazing, since it is provided by one of the great restaurants down below the hotel -- either Champagne or March\u00e9 -- and it is brought up quickly. Not a lot of waiting for your food, which was very nice. I was fortunate enough to get sunny weather while in Seattle so I was actually able to enjoy the hotel's rooftop deck and its spectacular views of Puget Sound for a bit. Last but not least, the location of the Inn at the Market is fantastic. You are right smack dab in the middle of the famous Pike Place Market, which has so many great restaurants, shops, bakeries, coffee shops (and the very first Starbucks too), parks and green space... just a fabulous place to hang out and explore. I can't wait to return to Seattle and stay here again.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBest find!\u201d", "Author": "Reflection2", "ReviewID": "UR127492441", "Content": "Inn at the market is the best place to stay when visiting downtown Seattle.

After perusing the reviews of various Seattle hotels here on Trip Advisor, I decided to book us at the Inn at the Market. We were very pleased with our choice! Our room was spacious and had a beautiful view of the water, the bed was quite comfortable, enough to make it difficult to get up in the mornings. The bathroom was clean and spacious, stocked daily with Gilchrist & Soames toiletries. My only beef with the bathroom was that the shower was incorporated into the tub, it was just a little bit inconvenient, but it didn't detract from the quality of our stay. Housekeeping was quite thorough, our room was always well cleaned daily. The door men were always amiable and helpful, and so were the front desk staff. The hotel had no restaurants, but it was within a little courtyard that also included the superb Cafe Campagne which served lovely French cuisine (We had dinner two nights in a row!); Bacco, a cafe that was only open for breakfast, which was quite satisfying; and Marche which we patronized every night for desert and drinks after dinner. There were also some interesting looking shops and a salon in the courtyard which I was never able to visit because by the time we would get back from training, they were all closed. The staff at Cafe Campagne and Marche were very friendly and helpful. We thought my husband left his cellphone at Marche on our last night and the staff helped him turn the place around to search for it.

We had a poorly operating coffee pot and it was immediately replaced with one that worked. The pillows were too soft, so we asked if we could have an extra one. The staff immediately came up with two tempurpedic pillows. I was impressed. When we got home we were asked by management to take a survey regarding our stay. I happened to mention the refusal of the Orange Cab driver, who took us to the airport, to give us the flat rate of $32, as stated on the cab's passenger window and confirmed by another cab driver, who had told us rates are metered when coming FROM the airport but charged a flat rate when GOING to the airport. Our cab driver stated we needed a form, provided by the hotel, in order to get the rate. Not true! I had also researched cab fares on the internet before leaving home. The manager of the Inn at the Market advised he would refer this cab incident to the transporation authority. I also sent an e-mail to Orange Cab advising I would not use their company in the future. I have not heard back for them---Go figure. Anyway, the only negative I have regarding our stay was the decor of our room. I actually laid in bed thinking a change in the pictures on the wall and the curtains would help. The room has a bit of a tired look and not pulled together. I also had an issue with the blower on the heater. It is winter and it is possible dust was blown into the air, as my eyes instantly acted up, when the heater went on.

The concierge gave me a handful the second time so I would not have to come back. The coffee maker was only partially cleaned one day (grounds were removed but the carafe was not washed). A dirty saucer was clearly not replaced one day; it still had coffee spillage on it. There was only one drinking glass one night and a glass was visibly cracked on a different day. There was a bedside lamp in which the light socket had come apart. That did not pose acute danger because the exposed wires were insulated and the switch was on the cord so the socket did not need to be touched. Perhaps the most annoying (minor) problems were with the shower/bath. The stopper -- the type where you just push down to toggle between close and open -- was very unresponsive and difficult to close. Equally inconvenient was the way the shower curtains were set up. There are two adjacent parallel shower curtain rods. I believe the inner bar is for the main curtain and the outer bar for the \"decorative\" outer curtains. In our bathroom, both curtains were on the same (outer) rod which meant that the edge of the inner curtain could not be placed near the wall because the outer curtain's (which was split into two pieces) hangers took up the space on the curtain rod closest to the wall. The inner curtain rod was not being used at all. Sorry for the convoluted explanation but the bottom line is that the inner curtain would not close against the wall so it was difficult to keep the water from splashing out of the shower. The bottom line: these are problems that we might be tempted to tolerate at a cheap motel but, perhaps, not even then. Inn at the Market should pay more attention to such details before I can give an unqualified endorsement to an otherwise excellent hotel.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bakersfield, ca", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "tfal06", "ReviewID": "UR122191960", "Content": "My wife and I celebrated her birthday at this wonderful hotel.

Not sure if I can mention room #'s or not but there are 2 rooms that have very private access to an incredible balcony. The \"common area\" hotel balcony on the 5th floor is amazing enough but if you want an extra special touch, spend the extra $$ and get 1 of the 2 rooms on the 7th floor that have private access to a huuggee balcony that is only accessible to said 2 rooms.

We did have a little trouble getting in. The room was not ready at 4 p.m., the normal check-in time, but we couldn't really complain because when we came back at 4:30 the room was ready and we had been upgraded to a suite with a perfect view of the iconic market sign, Elliott Bay and the Olympic Mountains beyond. This was a suite on two floors, with a large living room and kitchen downstairs and a spacious master bedroom and bathroom upstairs. Bed was very comfortable with great reading lights. We caught the beautiful sunset from the hotel's rooftop deck, where a lot of folks were sharing glasses of wine and snapping photos of the view. This is a great base for exploring Seattle. We walked down First Avenue to the Seattle Art Museum's sculpture park near Belltown and then walked back on the waterfront. Had breakfast at Seatown, one of Tom Douglas's newer restaurants, with an emphasis on smoked fish. Also walked the other direction, toward Pioneer Square, and of course checked out the fish, produce and craft stalls in the market itself. My only small caution would be that if you are looking for peace and quiet, this is probably not the place you want to be. The traffic noise from the viaduct below was quite loud all night even though I had my earplugs in.

Since it was so large, the few lamps at either end of the room did not provide enough light for the middle of the room where the closet was. Also when I stay in luxury hotels, I do expect the bathroom to be way above standard - this one was large, but not with much useful space. There were no drawers/shelves to put toiletries. Also the water pressure was so low. Although there was a nice size tub, it would have taken forever to use it. Plus the shower head had little pressure and was not adjustable so rinsing my long hair took a good amount of time. For the last part of our stay we stayed in a smaller room with a city view.

What a great way to get downtown. Since we were early we dropped our bags at the bell desk and went for a beverage and walk around the market which is just a few steps away.

The room has everything you need, including a corkscrew, and being on the 5th floor made for a quick walk to the beautiful deck. We spent a lot of time out there, the view is amazing.

It\u2019s been mentioned in just about every review but the location cannot be beat and it worth the price of the room. It allows you to go to the market before it gets busy, and is close walking distance to everything but the Space Needle and Safeco. The rooftop deck will make you realize that you\u2019ve spent your money wisely as you get to enjoy what makes Seattle a great city. I would advise going to Piroshky Piroshky for breakfast and Beecher\u2019s Cheeses for lunch as they are right around the corner and taking both up to the rooftop deck to enjoy a great view and better meal. Overall we were greatly impressed with the luxury and professionalism of the Inn at the Market, would recommend it to anyone staying in Seattle and will stay there upon our return.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harpenden, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and comfy beds\u201d", "Author": "Americophile_32", "ReviewID": "UR116820532", "Content": "This was the first part of our West Coast trip and what a great hotel.

The only downside to being in this crowded vicinity was that the site of the hotel was on a very small lot sandwiched between stores and other apartment buildings. It just felt a little too claustrophobic. The compensation for this dilemma is the wonderful common balcony area on the second floor which overlooked Pike's Place Market partially and afforded a full view of Seattle Harbor. On the flipside, because of the location, it was very convenient to grab meals anytime of the day because of the various delis and restaurants in the area. Also, it was walking distance to shopping malls, supermarkets, movie theaters and not to mention, the original Starbucks just down the hill. Be wary, though, of the many panhandlers and homeless when walking about. If you have a car, there is no self parking unless, you can find a public parking garage somewhere close by, otherwise the hotel has valet service and there is a parking charge of about $30.00 per night. Despite the fact that the location is in a busy neighborhood, the noise factor was remarkably not an issue, especially since we were on the second floor overlooking the street and stores. We had a room with double beds and ample room for a family with 2 active boys. It was clean and neat, but nothing spectacular. I thought the staff were cordial enough and helpful, but not overly helpful. The place exuded a very low key ambiance. Maybe it was the dim lighting or the fire place in the lobby that contributed to the effect. Overall, the room was decent, the hotel was small, the location was adequate, the atmosphere was sublime and the staff were professional. The room rate is perhaps justified because of the location at Pike's Place Market where everything seems to be overpriced. Not that I had an unpleasant experience at Inn at the Market, mind you, but I probably would try another hotel in Seattle, just for the change in scenery.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cMostly great, but some flaws\u201d", "Author": "BeforeSunrise", "ReviewID": "UR116591430", "Content": "There is a lot that is fantastic about Inn at the Market.

Worth noting though, our room had very few outlets which were in awkward places for charging devices (computers, cell phones, etc). And there is no desk in the room. The most inconvenient and impactful problem though was that our room (704) was very close to the exhaust fan of the restaurant below.

The Inn's courtyard is so charmiing, with a lovely sculpture at the center, surrounded by high quality small boutiques. The Cafe serves delicious French cuisine. The manager and wait staff are nice there also. Our room at the Inn has a partial bay view which is lovely. We also enjoyed hanging out at the roof deck common area to see the beautiful sunset over Eliott Bay. Seattle is a very charming city, and we find staying at the Inn at the Market really made our trip so special because of the friendliness of the front staff staff. The cleaning staff also greeted us each morning and afternoon with big smiles and warm greetings. The location, decor, services, and comfort level of the Inn are truly appreciated. We will go back to stay there for sure. In fact, we have already made reservation for the next summer and can't wait to return.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cWe loved it and will definitely be back\u201d", "Author": "carolynlyonsnewsome", "ReviewID": "UR115103107", "Content": "Inn at the Market in Seattle is a 5 star hotel located right in the hub of Pikes Market.

We arrived very early and were impressed from the start. Everyone we came into contact with was extemely nice and welcoming. I did not expect any rooms to be ready (10 am), but wanted to check our bags. One of our 3 rooms (2 Queen beds) was ready, so we had all of our bags sent to this room so we could freshen up. Our 2 Queen room was much larger than I had expected and was also able to fit a rollaway bed, which they happily provided. This alone made our stay better since our boys would be less likely to fight over pillows, the spot next to the table, etc. Our window faced a side street but had a beautiful view of the water to the left. There was a table and 2 chairs in front of the window where I liked to sit with my laptop and look out over the water. We had a fridge/ minibar, microwave, and large closet with many shelves. The bathroom was beautiful, clean and huge. I liked the bath products very much. The hairdryer left a lot to be desired for my long hair. I have yet to find a decent one in a hotel, so I always bring my own. We dropped our bags and went off to checkout the rest of the hotel and Public Market. I have to say that even if the hotel hadn't been as nice as it was, I still would have paid what I did (250 King city view and 320 2 Queen ) for the rooftop deck and proximity to Public Market. The deck is large with several tables with chairs, a few lounge chairs and an outdoor living room set. It looks directly over the market and the water. I went up every morning with my coffee and whatever treat I picked up at the Market. We also spent each evening up there reviewing our day's adventures over a bottle of wine. It was perfect. The location of the hotel cannot be beat if you truly want to be in the heart of it all. It is actually a part of the Market, so you walk out the door of the hotel, through its little courtyard (which I love) and you are there. It was wonderful to be able to wander at my leisure during the off hours than suffer the rat race that the Market can become in the middle of the day. If you haven't been to Seattle, it is filled with steep hills. Even though we were in a great location, my husband's parents usually called a cab to go anywhere beyond the Market. The rest of us easily walked to our destintation or to the bus tunnel or monorail. We did walk to Safeco Field as well (about a mile), but opted to take a cab back since going back was all uphill and we were tired. The hotel staff, as expected, were very helpful with checkout. The loaned us a scale for our luggage (airline fees :( ) They also helped us to arrange a van to the airport. I was very sad to leave this hotel and hope I have the opportunity to return.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westford MA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in a great location!\u201d", "Author": "RayCWestfordMA", "ReviewID": "UR115067412", "Content": "Nice hotel!

We asked for a taxi a couple of times and the front desk made their town car available to us. The room itself was beautiful. We had a water front suite with a wonderful view.....and the beds were very comforable. Couldn't have asked for a better experience.

In the morning, we went to Pike's Place Market and bought everything for a wonderful breakfast (fresh squeezed orange juice, smoked salmon, chocolate croissants, strawberries, etc...) and ate it on the deck, enjoying the amazing view. Very romantic. Would highly recommend Inn at the Market and hope to return.

It's got soul, plus all of the tick-boxes: enormous comfy bed, spacious bathroom, nice robes, warm cosy lobby with fire, great staff, excellent food in the restaurants (we had breakfast at Bacco both mornings - truly great coffee, I'm Australian so I know about these things). It's also got free wifi, which is so nice after being rorted by countless big hotels for use of their network, and a beautiful deck from which you can admire the Puget Sound. The only criticism I would make is that the air conditioning in the room was quite loud and would go on and off intermittently throughout the day and night.

But, the rooms are quiet enough that we slept a full night's sleep every night. <Side note: they have a sound system with a docking station for the iPod. Download the sleep machine app and you won't have a better night's sleep anywhere...> We enjoyed browsing the market each day for tasty fruit, snacks, cheese, etc. and utilizing our room's mini-fridge and microwave for fabulous in-room dining. <Side note #2: Unlike the Grand Hyatt, you can actually use your mini-fridge in the room to store your own food and drinks without fees and hassle. In fact, plates, service ware, and wine glasses were provided in our room to facilitate romantic evenings.> The deluxe water view afforded an expansive view of Puget Sound, the ferries, the mountains, sunsets, the market, etc. I am typically the frugal one in our family and prefer more utilitarian accommodations.

We came a day early for our Alaskan cruise. We picked the Inn at the Market from pictures and reviews on the internet, as well as its close proximity to the Pike Place Market. We were very impressed with our first impression of the Inn at the Market. The great view of the main entrance of the Pike Place Market, the attractive garden courtyard, and the sleek style of the front lobby. Landon met us at our cab and took custody of all of our bags. We met Noelle at the front counter. Although we were early for our check in time, she took our cell phone number to let us know when our room was ready. We were both incredibly impressed with her extremely friendly attitude and helpful manner. You could tell that she was just a genuinely nice person, and that she wasn't just being polite because it was an obligation for her position. Landon was very professional as well, introduced himself further at the check in desk, and arranged for our bags to be stored so we could begin to see Seattle. When we returned a little while later, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that we had been upgraded to a two story townhouse suite. The room was lovely, and had a stunning city view of the corner of Pine and 1st St. (great for people watching!!). I don't recall the name of the bellhop who brought our luggage to our room, but he was extremely polite and helpful as well. He filled our ice bucket before leaving. We were actually SAD that we had to leave the next day to go on our cruise!! Both Seattle and the Inn at the Market greatly exceeded our expectations. We hope to return soon, and will plan to stay at the Inn at the Market again. I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Seattle. It is located right at the entrance to Pike Place Market. The market is interesting, a wonderful place to pick up some handmade souvenirs by local artists, and a terrific place to try different ethnic foods. Within walking distance - The first Starbucks, The Seattle Aquarium, The Westlake Center Mall, a major bus / train stop (at the mall), Piroshky Piroshky (Russian pastries at the market), Pike Place Chowder (at the market), Le Panier (French pastries at the market). A helpful hint: You can take the train to and from Sea-Tac Airport for $2.50 a person one way. Much cheaper than the $45 fare from the airport or the $35 fare to the airport. It is really easy to use too... just go to the bottom floor of the mall. You can also catch the monorail from the top floor of the mall... we did not take this, but you can go to the Space Needle using this (cheaper than a taxi also). .", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chapin", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding location, great service\u201d", "Author": "ChapinChapin", "ReviewID": "UR77579651", "Content": "Truly enjoyed 3 night stay.

We called the desk and were told we were suppose to take the pillows out of the shams to use. We asked for more pillows but when the maid arrived we were shocked by her attitude. She came in screaming at us, threw the pillows on the bed, and proceeded to take on;e out of the shams and tell us that is what we were suppose to do! How rude! We called the desk and complained about her attitude and were told he would write a note to Housekeeping. We put the Do Not Disturb sign on our door and kept it there both days so that we wouldn't have to deal with rude housekeepers again. The second biggest problem was with departure. I had specifically requested a Town Car because I didn't want a taxi with the chance of getting someone who spoke little English and talked on the phone. Well, what we got was a SUV with a man who spole broken English and talked on the phone half of the time in another language. I complained about the vehicle to the young men who helped me with my luggage. I was told that I should take it since the desk has already charged me for it and that I'd then end up paying for it twice if they sent a second vehicle. I would have been better off with the taxi and saved money. When I returned home I filled out the questionnaire I received from the hotel online regarading my stay and received an apology saying they plan to update the linens and he would talk to the staff.

We had a hold up booking at our end because of the British Airways threatened strike action and communication between us and the hotel via email was superb, they were understanding, helpful and eased the stress and worries of our travel plans by holding our beautiful room without further question. We loved our short stay at Inn at the Market, would recommend it and also be staying with them again.

First all I have to say that you cannot beat the location of this hotel. Being only a very short walk to Pike's Market is awesome. We loved walking around the area, visiting the shops and eating at all the different locations. Lucky for us it was absolutely beautiful weather the three nights we were there. The room was wonderful and the bathroom was nice and large. The Ipod speakers were a nice touch and we liked getting the Seattle Times every morning. The small chocolates every night were a sweet treat. The staff was always very friendly and helpful in suggesting restaurants and talking about the area. The best part of the hotel is the (almost) rooftop terrace that looks out across the sound. On a nice day it was wonderful to have an escape with a wonderful view. My complaints of the hotel are few, but in general I would say that the basic rooms are overpriced for what you receive. I would recommend paying just a bit extra to get a room on the courtyard or have a sound view, because the street that we had a view of was less than desirable. Also, I'm glad that we got to try a Tempurpedic bed before purchasing one, because neither of us was a big fan. One other thing that would be a very cool touch in my opinion would be to have a hot tub up on the terrace. Just a suggestion of course. In all reality I would like to give this hotel a 4.5/5, but those very few complaints kept me from giving it the full 5.

The day of my reservation, December 1st, turned out to be a beautiful Seattle winter day. There was hardly a cloud in the sky as I pulled up to the valet stand for the Inn, several hours early for my check-in time. I was planning to have lunch nearby with my mother before checking in and didn\u2019t want to bother with finding street parking before I could have my car parked in the hotel lot. John, the valet, was happy to take my car for me. The front desk was incredibly accommodating as well, allowing me to check in early and letting me upgrade into a better room. Since I had never stayed in the hotel before, I had no real idea what to expect, aside from some of the pleasant looking pictures on their website. I received my room key and headed upstairs. (As a note, there was always an elevator open and waiting for me every time I entered the lobby!) I opened the door to a nice, spacious room. It was clean and bright and brightly lit by the afternoon sunlight despite all the curtains being drawn. I was in a bit of a hurry to meet my mother for lunch down the street, so I set my belongings down and went to head out the door. Before I left, I thought to myself, \u201cI can\u2019t really leave without taking a glance at the view, can I?\u201d I walked back across the room to pull the curtains aside and involuntarily gasped. The view was stunning and was coupled with a private patio that was almost as large as the room itself! Now, those who know me are familiar with my great love for Seattle and both its natural and man-made beauty. To be on that patio, standing over Elliott Bay with the embracing cityscape of the Emerald city surrounding me, was invigorating. After a moment of appreciation, I turned back into the room and noticed out of the corner of my eye four delicate cupcakes and hand-written card acknowledging my special occasion. An excellent touch. After lunch, some friends joined me in the room for some sparkling wine and conversation for a couple hours before dinner (dining out is my favorite way to celebrate). The hotel was quick to provide some extra glasses for our festivities and brought them up nearly in the time it took to open the bottle! The night was wonderful. It was so pleasant to wake up in their luxurious bed to another clear winter day beaming in through the windows and through the patio doors. A couple very relaxing hours of lazing around and I called down to the front desk to alert them that I would soon be ready for my car (as they had asked). After returning my keys I walked out the lobby of the hotel to see my car already waiting for me. Soon after returning home I realized that I had misplaced couple items. When I came back to the restaurant the next day I stopped by to inquire with the front desk if I had left them there. Sure enough, they had them set aside to return to me.

We booked our room via an Alaska Airlines Vacation Package. The package deal provided a free night (equating to a nearly $300 savings). The key elements of this hotel are the location and staff. The rooms are fine (not remarkable) but they are plenty clean and comfortable. We highly recommend staying here via a package deal to save some money. LOCATION: The hotel's location is tough to beat. It is literally right across the street from Pike Place Market and the original Starbucks. It is within a short walk to key Seattle downtown sites (Space Needle, Pioneer Square) and in our case we didn't have a car. Valet parking at the hotel runs about $30 a day.

They were pretty new and felt clean but did not exude luxury. The bed utilized a foam-based mattress (but was comfortable) and the sitting area was small but nice. Overall the room was the least memorable aspect of the stay but clearly not a reason to not book at this hotel. SERVICES: This hotel has an exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. From the moment we arrived (they set us up with an early check-in), to great food suggestions and a kind valet service we felt like service was king here. They provide a free choice of newspapers delivered to your room (Seattle Times, NY Times or WSJ), the hotel has a free shoe-shine service and they provided taxis and other needs without hesitation. The restaurant (which is connected but not affiliated) was good for breakfast but a bit expensive - it ran $40/couple. If you are willing to walk a little there are bagel shops and other food opportunities at reduced rates in the area. The wireless Internet was reliable and fast/free. OVERALL: Overall we would stay here again. We found rates to be a bit high through their website but would attempt to stay via a package deal.

The location makes it so easy to walk over to the Market for breakfast in the morning and is really a great home base for all your touring. Our room was fantastic.

Our room was quite large - we both were surprised at the ample seating area (sofa, coffee table and chair) and the large bathroom. The free wifi was great also. The hotel has a nice \"roof top\" deck, which unfortunately it was too cold for us to really use when we were there. I could definitely see having breakfast up there during nicer weather though.

When I did some internet research I learned that Seattle has lax laws toward panhandling, and that the panhandling is sometimes \"aggressive\". I also learned that that some of Seattle's services for the homeless are located in the market area. That being known, we avoided walking back through that area in the evenings and were were not harassed again there. This has nothing to do with the hotel but I think it's important to let people know to exercise caution in the market place after dark, especially since the hotel is adjacent to the Pike Market.

To say the suite was tired would be to heap praise where it isn't due.

Terrible, Terrible Service\u201d", "Author": "HockeyGDS", "ReviewID": "UR35998449", "Content": "For our anniversary and my first trip to Seattle, my husband chose the Inn at the Market for our stay due to the high reviews, its location and the services they provide. Although Expedia booked us for a city view room, my husband sent a message to the hotel and told them he was willing to pay for an upgrade to a water view room. We never received a response from the hotel despite that fact that he sent the request for an upgrade two and a half months in advance. Finally my husband contacted them a couple of weeks before our trip and they informed us that they had just booked every room. The town car service is a joke. The first time we used it, the driver (who is also the bell hop) didn\u2019t know where the museum was, despite the fact that we had the address and its major cross streets. After driving around the block once, he told us that he needed to get back to the hotel and that maybe we would have better luck finding it on foot. So he dropped us off in the \u201cghetto\u201d (he literally dropped us off at the door of a homeless shelter with people loitering, smoking marijuana and talking to themselves). We had no idea where we were or where we needed to be going and we totally stood out. Luckily someone was able to point us in the right direction. The driver had dropped us off about four blocks away from where we asked to go. Had I been that driver I would have at least called the hotel and asked if they could have provided me with directions, not dropped the tourist off in a highly questionable neighborhood telling them that typically the bums don\u2019t cause people trouble during the day as a reassurance! Our second experience with the town car was even worse. We had a dinner reservation at the Space Needle for our anniversary and when we inquired about using the town car, we were told that due to the Sea Fair Torch parade and traffic being difficult to navigate that they couldn't be bothered with the town car. (As tourist, one of the times you need a courtesy car the most is when traffic and typical routes are difficult to navigate due to a special event!) At this point we asked what they recommended we do and they suggested a cab or the monorail. We thought maybe the hotel company had a specific cab company they used, but no, they just hail whatever cab happens to be driving by and because the streets were closing down for the parade not a lot of cabs were going by. We ended up taking the monorail which is about five or six blocks away from the hotel. On our walk back to the hotel after dinner we had the pleasure of walking by a \u201csuspected\u201d gang shooting as it took place (two blocks away from the hotel). We were walking when we heard seven gunshots and suddenly we were surrounded by suspected gang members and police officers with guns and TAZERS drawn. Checking the Seattle Times, we were relieved to learn that only one person was wounded and no one had died, but it obviously wasn\u2019t the end to our anniversary night that we had hoped for. With the amount of money we were paying for the room (not to mention the $25 a day to \u201cvalet\u201d the car), I really expected superior service. The view was the best part and it was only \"nice\", it wasn\u2019t worth all the money we were paying. Either they have really poor customer service standards or they treated us poorly because we booked through Expedia, either way I will not recommend that hotel to anyone. It just wasn\u2019t worth the money in the long run.

Also, the air conditioner is very noisy when it goes on/off during the night, often waking us up. The queen bed was comfortable, but awfully squeaky.

The front desk staff helped me get last minute tickets to a Beyonce concert. 3) By the 3rd day I could not stand the pain. I had been taking pain medication for an abscessed tooth but now I needed an emergency root canal or get the tooth pulled...the infection had spread and even my eye was swollen. Not only did staff members find me a top notch endodontist in less than 10 minutes but they managed to make me an appt for that afternoon! Even though I was leaving that day they allowed me to check out late and go straight from the hotel to the dentist. Before I left a caring maintenance man who came to the room to adjust the heat ( I was to sick to do it ) noticed how bad I felt and brought me a special pot and lots of tea. Together the the staff saved me from further pain and I did not have to have my tooth pulled.

Landon assisted us with our bags and quickly set them in the room and showed us the room features. Our room was a king, partial water view room, which remained true to its description. The room was large and well appointed. The bathroom was large with some nice features, including a basket for soiled towels, nice, plentiful amenities, a dimmer switch on the overhead light, and nice artwork, something you don't normally see in a bathroom. The window coverings are made from very nice, beautiful fabric, and the bed and pillows are quite comfortable.

I emailed him and requested that he arrange \"something special\" for us upon our arrival. We were absolutely thrilled to arrive and find a bottle of Tattinger champagne and the most heavenly chocolate cake I've ever tasted, waiting on us in our room. The hand written congratulations card was a very nice touch. I think that we were also upgraded based on the fact that we had paid for a room with a city view but our room had a partial water view along with the city view. In my mind, its the little things that make this place special. The attention to detail by the housekeeping staff was outstanding. Noticing that my husband had doubled his pillow up for added support, we came back to our room the next night to find an extra set of pillows on our bed. That's just one example. Another night, we had dinner reservations and asked for a cab. When we came downstairs, the ladies at the desk offered us the town car instead! We loved the Seattle Chocolates on our bed each night and the free wireless internet was a very nice touch. We ordered room service from Campagne and it was absolutely fabulous. I honestly could go on and on about our trip, it was absolutely amazing. If I had to levy one complaint, it would be that the TV channels were pretty dismal. I only noticed this because as honeymooners, we were in our room more than we would've been on a normal trip! 4 government access channels, no music, no HBO, etc. The reception was also grainy most of the time.

(you can see multiple reviews of it online) And I mean hard, not firm. If you like any softness with your bed you will not be comfortable. Personally I\u2019m surprised a hotel would go for such a specialty mattress in every room because this is clearly a mattress that is designed more for a specific group of people with back problems, etc. then the general public. Basically it\u2019s the type of mattress you\u2019ll either love or hate with no in-between. There were super hard pillows the 1st night too, but the 2nd night regular pillows appeared after the room was cleaned, which was nice. And the bed linen/comforter itself was very nice and warm. This a tiny hotel so unable to do laundry on certain days which was inconvenient for us(unable to do on Saturday after 9am or Sunday\u2019s) View from 3rd floor was a view of a wall 5 feet away. But if you aren\u2019t planning to spend a lot of time in the room\u2026 (otherwise try to get a room on at least 4th floor) Some rooms don\u2019t have bathtubs and they should tell you before assigning that room to you. Between entering the hotel and getting to room had to tip 3 different people. (but they were very nice) Sink in bathroom was extremely dirty at check-in; it cleaned easily so not sure why it was so filthy; tiny shower head; and bathtub space is tiny (again, not sure why since the hotel room itself was quite large and there bathroom area is actually a decent size) Taking a shower is an exercise in fighting off the shower curtain and not falling out of the tub. And I'm not a big person but it was like the size of the tub was tiny for some reason. Lighting in room is too dark for reading (bathroom had decent light) No on-site gym; have to pay $15/day to use city gym a few blocks away Limited TV. channels (I could be spoiled though since I\u2019m use to hotels having flat screens and lots of HD channels/movie channels); they had the basics\u2026CNN, ESPN, and local I find it annoying when housekeeping calls to ask about servicing your room when you clearly have a do-not-disturb sign up. It little things that make a hotel 4 vs. 3 stars. Ie>Just invest in \u201cwe tried to service your room\u201d signs and slip it under the door. I\u2019ll get the message without you annoying me every single day when I clearly asked not to be disturbed. ----------------------------------------------------- THE GOOD :-) Free internet (always a big plus!) and it was fast wireless. Spacious room and bedroom area was clean; lots of space in closet Provided decent robes; iron/board Overall staff was very friendly and helpful. Refrigerator in room was nice for storage of food from Pike Place (and you will end up with something with all the meats, cheeses, etc) Room service was fast and prices aren\u2019t crazy. It's the restaurant menu but okay. Had minibar products in room; lots of snacks Bar service in Campagne was excellent with very friendly and professional bartenders Had room opening to cute courtyard but only heard loud noise once; much quieter than anticipated which was great. Doors should have chain/deadbolt on top since they open to outside though. (one turn lock didn't feel secure) 5th floor rooftop is a great place to get a view of the city day or night. I appreciated it was open 24/7 just to go up and view the city/water. Air/heat control in room was great You could throw a rock and hit Pike Place Market, fantastic location (which is their best feature) It's a cute little open style hotel and you don't dread going 'home' at the end of the day which is nice. ------------------------------------------------------------------- OVERALL Overall this is not a 4 star hotel, but definitely a very nice solid 3 star and I would stay again due to location if the rate were under $200. (Even with the bed which I really didn\u2019t like but could tolerate.) But to be honest, if I wanted true 4 or 5 star experience with the same great location, great service, gorgeous rooms, great staff, etc. I would stay at the new Four Seasons one block away again. It\u2019s still directly next to Pike Place Market but a much higher value for my money.

It was our first time in Seattle, and the location was absolutely perfect. It cannot be emphasized enough that the Inn is literally on the same block as the Market. Outside the front door and to your right is Beecher's (the best mac and cheese in the world), amazing little wine shops, and all the vendors you could ever hope to experience (art, food, flowers, clothing). To your left is 1st Ave, where you will find great restaurants, museums, and shopping all within very close walking distance. The room we stayed in faced the interior courtyard and we had a momentary regret that we didn't book a room facing the gorgeous view of the water and mountains, but then remembered that we weren't planning to spend much time in the room anyhow - this is Seattle after all! The room was not particularly fancy but it was very clean, the bed was very comfortable, and the room was very quiet even though the hotel is in a busy location and the courtyard could create an echo chamber (it doesn't). A very nice touch was the 2 tiny cupcakes left by our bedside when we returned on Saturday night - the chocolate especially was delicious. Two minor staffing complaints: First, and this is pretty minor -- the day we were checking out (Sunday), the housekeeping staff knocked on our door first at 8:45, then again at 9:15, then again at 9:45 (both of us were awake and working on our laptops from the room). Given that checkout is not until noon, at which time they would theoretically be cleaning the room again anyhow, it was a little obnoxious to receive repeated interruptions from housekeeping. Second, and this is by far the worse transgression -- the young woman staffing the front desk when we checked in was unbelievably rude (and I'm not someone who usually cares about this sort of thing - I've certainly never posted a complaint on Tripadvisor before). I had emailed the hotel's info email address [--] to request that the hotel make a reservation for at the hotel's restaurant, Campagne. I heard that it was outstanding and romantic and thought it would be nice to eat there on Valentine's Day. I sent the email 2 weeks beforehand and, of course, included the fact that we would be guests at the hotel. I probably should have called the restaurant as well, but at a hotel this nice, one would expect the staff to be willing to take care of that sort of thing. I never received a response (clue #2 that I should have called to confirm), and when we arrived and we noted that we were looking forward to the restaurant and asked to confirm the reservation, the woman working at the front desk said that we hadn't made one. When I explained that I had sent an email to the hotel, she said in a really rude manner, \"well, I never received that email and we are full.\" I explained that I sent it to the info email address and even showed her the email from my Blackberry screen. She said, \"I don't receive those emails at my personal account,\" which of course was not the point - I wasn't saying I sent it to her, just to the hotel. At that point, someone from the restaurant's staff was standing near the reservation desk and recommended that we try to walk in as there are unreserved tables near the bar. I asked if it would be possible to make a special exception and allow us to reserve one, given that we had attempted to make a reservation 2 weeks earlier and that it was Valentine's Day. The woman at the front desk actually interrupted and said no, we would have to wait like anyone else. I wish I had remembered to ask for her name, but she had long(ish) straight hair and wore glasses and was working at the desk at about 2:30 pm on Saturday when we checked in. We ended up having a great dinner elsewhere and even though we had wanted to try the restaurant, we opted for Cafe Juanita the next night. Her behavior was unprovoked and totally out of character from everyone else at the hotel - other folks were super nice (especially the valets). As I said earlier, the hotel was in a superb location and the rooms were nice and reasonably priced.

I've read a lot of mixed reviews on the Inn and all I can say is we had a really nice experience there. We're not big on paying a lot for a view in any hotel room because we just don't spend that much time in our room so we opted for a city view. We were in room 408 and it has a view of the courtyard that you walk through as you enter the hotel. For a view of the water, we were very satisfied with simply going up to the 5th floor deck where you had an unlimited view of Elliot Bay, Mt. Rainier, the waterfront and everything you'd see if you had a water view room. We took so many pictures from the deck and just stood there and admired the view. It was a nice place to strike up a conversation with other guests and overall, a nice place to escape the hustle of the Market area below. Our room was lovely and spacious and we saw no signs of any of the wear and tear that some reviews have mentioned. The bathroom in our room was the size of a small bedroom! And one thing I really loved about the bathroom was the shelving unit available for us to put our bathroom things on. Every hotel should offer this so that you don't have to live completely out of your suitcase or have a thousand things on the back of the toilet simply for them to be handy. The tempurpedic bed got a mixed review. I had no issues with it and found it quite comfortable. My husband...not so much. He would have liked a firmer mattress and he said he felt as if he was sleeping on his head the entire time. Overall though, it was fine. We don't normally make a lot of use of concierge services, etc. and we're not big users of room service either so I can't speak a lot about that. We did order dessert through room service one night and it was very nice. For breakfast, we went to the Market Bagel shop over on 1st Ave. (about 1/2 block south of the hotel) for a very inexpensive breakfast a couple of days. One day we walked a few blocks to a nearby coffee shop (no, not Starbucks...we avoided corporate coffee), Cafe Ladro. VERY good coffee and pastries and worth the 6 or 7 blocks to walk. Dinners were mostly eaten in and around the Market area. We can highly recommend Shiro Sushi (again, within easy walking distance) and it was highly recommended to us by one of the front desk staff. (Just a tip: Ivar's is so overrated don't waste your time. We live in the Midwest and we've had fish here that was so much better than that Long John Silver's knockoff.) The Market area itself is a zoo. If you don't like walking into people/crowds in general, you'll go nuts here after a couple of days. Granted, we were there over a holiday weekend and during the last day of Bumbershoot but even after that ended, it was still nuts. It really wasn't the crowds that got to us so much as the buskers (annoying with a capital A and basically everywhere you turn) and the seemingly endless supply of insane people. That was our biggest takeaway from Seattle: is every third person on the street insane? Not that we ever felt threatened, quite the contrary. But we had people just randomly yell at us (and everyone else around them), hiss at us like a cat, skateboard by us singing a song about Chairman Mao...it seemed to never end. I guess you can call it free street theatre. The Inn is in the midst of all this and we were definitely at the heart of all the action. The bell staff was incredibly friendly, the front-desk staff was helpful, the room was very nice, the location was tourism ground zero. Not really sure how we could have improved on the experience. (Oh and it was sunny and 68 every day we were there! So much for the Seattle drizzle experience!) Honestly if I had one complaint it would be the TV channel selection. There are about 20 channels, half of which are sports, the other half local government and news. Boring, boring, boring. But again, we don't go on vacation to watch TV. But if you're looking for something interesting to watch as you fall asleep...good luck to you my friend.

The Inn at the Market was the first hotel we stayed at. It still stands out as a hotel that I would recommend to friends going to Seattle. I booked this hotel directly and immediately had the feeling I would be happy there. The girl on the other end of the line could not have been more friendly or willing to please. When we arrived we were quickly taken up to our room and famiiarized with what the room had to offer. We had booked a two story suite which was perfect for my husband, myself and daughter. We all had our privacy and my daughter had a separate tv and pull out couch that was made up immediately on request. We all had the same great view of the water and the public market. The hotel has a lovely patio that overlooks the water. It is raised so provides a wonderful view. My daughter and I went out there after dinner and had a wonderful relaxing chat about our day before going upstairs to bed. The only negative would be that there is only one bathroom and it is upstairs (and the stairs would not be good for someone handicapped although my husband struggles with walking because of car accident and he had no complaints) so if you aren't a good sharer and you are traveling with more then your spouse/friend take this into consideration. We had friends come in from Vancouver the last night of our stay and the hotel was very good about finding us last minute reservations for five to accomodate their arrival time. I will say that we were very lucky weatherwise and that on foggy, drizzly or rainy days that our impressions might not have been quite so good but that would not be the hotel's fault. I have also read other reviews from fellow travelers that did not give the hotel high marks for rooms with city views because of noise. However, I always think you get what you pay for. One other big plus for this hotel is its proximity to the Public Market. It is literally a two minute walk.

Besides, we are loyal Best Western guests, and Inn at the Market is more than double the rate of even the finest Best Western motel. Inn at the Market is quintessential Seattle - friendly, casual yet elegant, pleasing to the senses, practical. For reasons unknown, we were upgraded to a suite with gorgeous water views (my daughter insists she did not tell the hotel that we were celebrating my 55th birthday). The location can't be beat - in the heart of Pike Market, next to a fine (but pricey) French restaurant. The hotel itself houses a breakfast and lunch cafe which we wish we had tried, as the food fragrances were yummy and the place was packed. All day in-and-out valet parking (extra charge) made it easy to tour Seattle without fearing the loss of precious parking.

It's right above the Pike Place Market (not literally) and in the heart of downtown. Each morning, we could step outside, and get breakfast from a multitude of local eateries, and then stroll through the market to pick up grapefruit-size apples.

The room itself is rather spacious, and the Tempur Pedic bed was really nice. I wasn't used to it, and slept only ok on it, but at least they went the extra mile to put those high end mattresses in the rooms. The bathroom was also very nice, and very clean. There is a stocked honor bar and mini-fridge (which I used to store my own drinks and cold items), as well as a room safe. The view from the room was awesome. We were supposed to have a \"city view\" but I got a partial water view from my room.

The only complaint I would have is the TV reception was not very good, and the number of stations was very limited. We didn't even get the weather channel, and this is Seattle in winter!!! But, who spends their vacation watching TV in the hotel? Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel. Its location cannot be beat, and the boutique feel to it was very nice.

Overall a great, small sized hotel, located in a bustling part of Seattle. We loved it. The rest of my review are tips and critiques to make the place better or your visit more enjoyable: You will probably hear street noise from your room. Expect it. This hotel is located in the heart of the city, so it's not a quiet retreat. I don't recommend bringing a car here. You'll probably have to valet park as there is not much parking nearby. We walked to a lot of places and took taxis to places not too far away. Our biggest complaint was the bathroom. It was a bit cramped and there was not much surface area to set our stuff.

Plenty of great restaurants to go to and it is generally a fun area to be in. That is if you are a tourist. However, the quality of the hotel itself is only so-so. This is not a place for business travellers. I might be a bit hard on them especially since I just returned from a trip to HK where I stayed at the Conrad HK and Wynn Macau. Compared to those the Inn feels like motel 6. Issues: 1. There is no desks in the rooms to place your laptops on. Even if you have wireless internet, there is no place to work on but your bed. 2. Furniture and coverings are worned and just outdated. 3. Room 409 is a city view room. The last room they had for that date. Avoid at all cost because its window sits right above the bus stop. They claim that the windows are double paned but I could hear the buses' roaring engines. I had to sleep with ear plugs which they had at the front desk. 4. The AC is a standalone unit attached to the wall. This is not part of a central system. The standalone unit made quite a bit of noise. It looks cheap and tacky too. 5. There is no business center. Only a fax machine located in the basement of the hotel. For the price you pay you are paying for the location only. The staff are extremely friendly though.

We also found the staff to be very friendly and competent. All of the desk personnel are concierges. They booked several reservations and cruises for us.

The lobby is modest but comfortable - you'll note that there are no pictures of the lobby on the website, because it's not much of a selling point. The courtyard, however, was quaint and quite pleasant. The fountain is relaxing, and the brick facade with the hanging ivy is a beautiful entry. I had a courtyard view room at the 4th floor, which has no view of Elliot Bay. I think you need to be at the 6th or higher for a bay view. The room was enormous and comfortable, and the bathroom is spacious. The ceilings were high, as expected of an older building. The bed was a king size Tempurpedic, as advertised. If you've never slept in a Tempurpedic, I must say that it is similar to an Asian hotel experience - the bed seems very hard at first, but gradually (slowly) forms to your shape, for a rested sleep - it just doesn't seem like it at first! The restaurant, Campagne, is an excellent (though smallish) French style restaurant, with a good wine selection, particularly the dessert wines (if there's any remaining, try the Cuvee Boytrytis-amazing!). Room service is offered from here, and I can only assume the experience will be as nice. There is a small coffee shop with morning bakery, and that was a delight first thing in the morning. The morning paper was at the door, and although the offerings included the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, I opted for the local paper. In-room wireless internet was complimentary, and signal strength in the room was fine. The location is simply wonderful, literally across the street from Post Alley and well-known pub Kell's, and (in my opinion) a better, local favorite White Horse Pub - DO stop in and give this gem a try!

I wish I had a full day to appreciate the rooftop deck, because it was delightful first thing in the morning (again, I refer to the pictures).

We had a very nice time at this small, comfortably furnished hotel that has a great location just up the hill from Pike Place Market. The walk to the convention center is about 8 blocks east, pretty easy except for the steep 1/2 block adjacent to the hotel. There are a number of trendy restaurants as you walk north on First Ave. and Pioneer Square with its old stone buildings and charming pergola is south along the same road. And of course, the market is a 1/2 block to the west and has many food stands, boutiques, fish and flower stalls, handicrafts, jewelry tables, entertainers, and ethnic dining options that spill onto the narrow alleys and covered arcades. It was a pleasure to wake up in the morning and grab something to eat nearby while watching the small trucks and vans unload their wares and the vendors set up their tables. Our room was on the corner overlooking the city and was very spacious, with lots of storage space in the wardrobe and a large bathroom. The sink was a pedestal-type, so spreading out toiletries was limited to the glass shelf or nearby small table/shelf unit. We could hear traffic noise from the street, which was annoying, but we did request their lowest-priced room and it is in the city, so I wasn't expecting total silence when we closed the doors. The rooms have window seats with pillows, a nice feature that makes the rooms appear bigger and provides additional seating or a good spot for reading while people-watching. The decor is contemporary, with beiges, browns, and blacks predominating. In good weather, the upstairs terrace would be a nice place to sit and enjoy the views of the bay and the market. The modern, brick building surrounds a pleasant courtyard with a splashing fountain/sculpture adjacent to some outdoor seating for the hotel restaurant. The lobby opens off the courtyard and has a fireplace, stuffed chairs, and the registration desk, where the helpful staff operates. We enjoyed our time here. The hotel is a nice option for those who don't want a large convention hotel in a central Seattle location. Do be aware that Seattle does have its share of street people and that there are a couple of strip clubs near the front of Pike Place Market.", "Date": "October 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London England", "Title": "\u201cGreat views from terrace but only a brick wall from our window....\u201d", "Author": "savvyttraveller", "ReviewID": "UR5903529", "Content": "We stayed here for one night before heading off into the Cascade mountains.

We were very disappointed though when we opened the curtains and found our 'city view' was in fact a brick wall about 6 feet away. If we had been staying longer we would have asked to be moved, although we did ask when we checked in if any waterview rooms were available and were told no. It was very obvious though later in the evening when we were sitting on the terrace that only a few were occupied. We took other peoples advice and went up to the deck with a bottle of Champagne - (glasses from reception). The views and the spectacular sunset certainly made up for the brick wall outside our window! Beware - if you arrive on a Monday or Tuesday evening there is no room service. Not what you want to hear after a very long day and only airline food to sustain you. Also every restaurant in the immediate vicinity was closed - only place we could get a sandwich was a Deli round the corner. Position is great next to Pike Place Market but when we returned to Seattle after a few days, we stayed at the Marriott Waterfront.

The beds were really comfortable, and the linens were top-notch. Okay, now on to the service: in one word, fantastic. It's extremely important to me to be greeted with a casual and genuine manner every time I enter or leave a hotel, with eye-contact.... sounds easy, but it's a rarity in today's hotel market. No matter when we came or went, we were always greeted with a smile and eye contact - I really love that. The staff was more than helpful and always went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure that we were well taken care of, that we knew about the great places to see and wonderful restaurants to dine at. Some hotels just don't get it, but Inn at the Market definitely understands that excellent service is what hospitality is all about.

The hotel was very stylishly decorated, and the lobby area had just been redone (still smelled slightly of paint). Our room was unexpectedly large, and so was the bathroom. It seemed a bit of a waste of space to have such a large bathroom but only have a regular size tub with in-tub shower (and the shower head was not on a hose, which I missed). Still, it was trendily decorated in the Pottery Barn style, and clean and quite comfortable. Our room overlooked the harbor, which was great and made it a bit quieter. The amenities, comfort, style, and location made it a great place to explore Seattle from. The staff could use some work in terms of turning this into a top-notch service hotel. Two examples: 1) The first night we arrived late (10pm) and asked about places we could get a bite to eat. First, the (young) man behind the desk recommended their own restaurant for desserts. I then asked if there were any nearby tapas places (and I pronounced it in correct Spanish \"tah-pahs\" rather than \"taa-paas\"). He just stared at me for a moment, then said there were a couple of places just down the street. Turns out, he was directing me to two strip clubs (he thought I said \"topless\"). I am a 46 year old woman, and was with my husband. Seems pretty unlikely that I would be asking about topless bars, and he must have thought that or he wouldn't have stared so. Didn't it occur to him to ask me to repeat myself, or to look puzzled and ask me to describe the type of place I was looking for? Inexperience, I guess. After wandering up and down the street, and seeing The Lusty Lady and Showgirls, but no tapas restaurants, my husband and I did get a big laugh. 2) There is no place to park near the hotel--you have to use their valet parking, where you drop your car off right in front of the hotel. The second night we were there, the street in front of the hotel was closed and we couldn't get to the valet area. We drove around for 15 minutes, trying to find a different way in. We finally had to move some police barriers on another street and sneak in to get in front of the hotel. The desk was apologetic, but shrugged it off. And it must happen regularly--in the morning it was clear that the street was closed due to bigger happenings at the market on a Saturday. How difficult would it have been for the hotel to move its little valet parking sign and the valets and have the guests drop their cars off at the corner, 30 feet away? These are minor glitches, but for $300+ a night, you expect a hotel to work these sorts of kinks out of the system.

The hotel is nice, and the location cannot be beat, I challenge you to find a more centrally located place to stay in downtown Seattle. The rooms are above average, the bathrooms are huge and very nice. I must echo a previous negative review, however, and state that at this price range I'd expect a lot more. We paid $165 a night at the IATM, and only $200 at the Sheraton on a previous trip. While the Sheraton wasn't as centrally located as the IATM, you felt like you were staying in a $200/night hotel, it was very nice. A few things stand out at the IATM: 1. Valet parking is very expensive at $25 a night. Expedia notes that there is a free parking option, that's apparently not correct. In fact, there's no alternative to valet parking at all unless you want to park in an outdoor, unsecure lot a block away. 2. Ceiling lights out in our room that housekeeping didn't fix, even after pointing it out to them. 3. Telephone didn't work, the only way you could get out was to dial \"0.\" 4. Television in our room was inexplicably located directly to the left of the bed. To watch TV required one to sit sideways on the bed or lay on your side. 5. The foam posturpedic beds, which I hear a lot of people like, nearly paralyzed my wife with back pain. I guess the hotel can't be held responsible for this because I'm sure most people like them, but they should have other options for people that don't. We surely won't be buying one of those matresses any time soon. Overall, not a bad hotel, just a bit too much for what you get. I guess you pay a lot for the location, a bit too much in our opinion.
