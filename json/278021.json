It was my third or fourth stay there. We decided at the last minute to have a romantic night away from the Bay area with our dogs. I called the Ranch and found a great deal on a two bedroom suite.(One of us snores which is an expensive problem when traveling!) We drove up to Calistoga with our two small dogs and arrived at the lovely property to be cordially greeted by the staff and taken immediately to our incredible series of rooms! The two bedroom suite consisted of two bedrooms, two bathrooms, an outside living room, a kitchen(fully functioning) and an inside living room. My friend, who is a sucessful author, expressed a desire to return and stay for a week while writing his next novel. We had scheduled massages in the calming spa and this was the only low point of our visit. Both of us felt the skill level of our therapist was not up to par which was disappointing. We had dinner in the dining room with some friends and it was delicious! I love the dining room as it has a magical view of the gentle mountainside and the staff are very personable. The Ranch is very pet friendly and provides your dogs with treats and bowls for food and water. Dogs are permitted in most areas of the Ranch with the exception of the dining areas. Best Rooms: Spring for a suite if you can afford it as the regular rooms feel cramped to me. All the rooms are nicely furbished and have lovely bathrooms but the suites have nice outdoor areas as well as separate living rooms. Best time to go: I would say the best time to enjoy this resort is in warmer weather as one cant make use of the outdoor areas in winter. Despite the cold temperature when we visited, however, we had a great time.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cA perfect getaway\u201d", "Author": "extrapagespassport", "ReviewID": "UR127613523", "Content": "We spent four nights here in April and could not have been more delighted with the property and the staff. Gloria and Gregory did a wonderful job helping us plan winery visits -don't miss Schramsberg but also the tiny winery, Zathila down the road, was a true find that we would never have known about. Bikes are definitely a good way to tour; we did a very nice guided tour but it's not necessary. Just grab a bike and helmut and the map from the hotel and go. We stayed in a one bedroom with living room and loved the setup of the two separate spaces divided by a deck, though families might not. In general, we were great fans of the architectural style - elegant, tasteful, rustic. The outdoor space - both the very private and romantic shower as well as the deck with fireplace - was great; next time we'll try to spend more time on the property just enjoying the chance to relax. The property is big with good hiking trails and we loved the temporary help - the adorable babydoll sheep who are keeping the weeds down in the small onsite vineyard. My husband and I also both enjoyed the spa; my massage was ok but I had the best facial ever from Susan. With so many phenomenal restaurants in the area, we would be inclined to go out for meals.

The setting for breakfast was fantastic, and I can honestly say that I had of the best massage treatments of my life at the spa which was also beautiful.

The meal was fantastic but the lack of a shuttle to a sister location combined with the expensive taxis (which I think are typical for the area) was surprising to us.

We went with our two boys ages 6 and 11. They lived in the hot tub on the porch. The outside shower was great as well. Products in the bathroom were loved by all. The separate rooms were great and allowed us a lot of options between sleeping area and areas where people needed to work or watch TV. Unfortunately cell service was very bad at the room so that caused some issues in terms of trying to get some work done. We had dinner one night at the Lakehouse which was good but I think in the future we will opt to go off campus as there are so many options. The little town of Calistoga is charming and worth a trip. The Spa at the Ranch was exceptional. We had a fabulous masseuse who was really one of the best and facilities were lovely and unique.

There was a expected level of service and comfort but what was given after we arrived on the property far exceeded what we expected. You are at the Northern end of the valley but you are closer than you think to the other towns. You do give up your vehicle to the valet whenever you are on the property, but have no fear, there are golf cart shuttles with the absolute best bellmen (thank you Shane) that will take you wherever you need to go \"in a blink of an eye\". The grounds are very safe and well kept with fountains in front of some lodges and are just a pleasure to stroll around. The front desk staff are very welcoming and pleasant and Greg is one of the best Guest Relations Coordinators around. Breakfast and service in the Lakehouse was very good with a nice selection of items. Dinner was a preset menu. Since the Lakehouse is only for registered guests, it seems as if you have the entire dining space to yourself. Beautiful canyon and lake views. We even saw deer that evening. The Bay Forest Spa Lodge was TERRIFIC ! ! Some members were concerned that the spa was visible by others but I did not find that to be a problem. Maybe it was the placement of our lodge. Since the open area is raised and there is very little traffic in front of your lodge to begin with, you should have a fair amount of privacy. Note that it is located in the front rather than the back of the lodge. Take that into consideration \"party people\". The other lodges do not overlook your outdoor area at all. A large outdoor living area with fireplace sets the tone. The bedroom and bathroom were equally as wonderful. The mindset of indoor and outdoor is nonexistent sometimes. Speaking of outdoor, the outside shower is a MUST ! ! ! One of the highlights of the stay. A huge bathroom that also blurred the line between indoor and outdoor. If I had one thing to say it would be the consistency of the bath towels. Not what I expected considering my surroundings. A great sound system and comfortable furnishings are a welcome retreat after a day of tastings, however, I could see how in the cooler tempertures the floor plan would not benefit some, but you are a part of nature first here.

I read all of the reviews and wanted to stay someplace extra-special for this momentous occasion. To give you an idea, the 2 days prior to arriving we were in Monterey staying at the Lodge at Pebble Beach and I gave my husband a round of golf at the famous course. I wanted this to be a weekend to remember! Let me start by saying that I was really, really, really excited about staying at Calistoga Ranch. The pictures of the website were amazing and we had heard nothing but great things about it. I wanted to come back and rate it 5 stars and rave on and on about how perfect our weekend was. Unfortunately I spent the last hour there on-line looking at where we would stay in Napa the next time. Let me start with the positives, as I did rate this a 3 because there were some really great things about the place. First of all, it is a beautiful property and is very peaceful and serene. We stayed in the very top room which was extremely secluded and special. We never heard a peep from anyone up there, which we absolutely loved. The outdoor shower was the highlight - I could have showered for hours out there in the crisp morning air. We loved the breakfast....the banana walnut pancakes were heaven on earth. They did a fabulous job of accommodating us when we were in a rush one morning and Shelly got us in and out quickly. She was fantastic both mornings we ate there - very helpful and great attitude. Lastly I appreciated that they noted my husband's birthday and had a nice card in the room greeting us upon arrival. Unfortunately we felt that we paid too much for what we got overall. For $910 a night, we expected great service like we have received at countless other resorts in that price range. Had we paid $400/night, I think we would have been more lenient. First of all, I got an e-mail from the concierge a couple weeks before with a \"pre-arrival\" form to fill out with any requests I might have for our trip. I did request a dinner reservation at their restaurant on the night of our arrival, and also assistance with setting up a driver for our day touring the wineries. I submitted the form and never heard a peep. I ended up calling the restaurant myself and making the reservation. I also searched the internet and found my own driving service, as well as wineries to visit based on reviews. (To give Calistoga Ranch some credit, I did tell someone about this once we were there and we received a complimentary bottle of wine in our room with an apology note.) However, I was still disappointed that I ended up doing all of the work myself. After our arrival, I got an \"in room\" pedicure from the spa. Apparently they do not provide this service at the spa itself, and recently started offering it in the rooms since they had so many requests for it. I've never heard of a high-end spa that doesn't offer pedicures! The very nice girl came to give me my pedicure, and although she was as sweet as can be, the pedicure was one of the worst I've had. Notably, she soaked my feet in cold water. She did not use a basecoat and applied the very dark nail polish straight onto my bare toenails. I don't even want to know how yellow my toenails will be after that! She did not use anything to exfoliate except for a light lotion that had some exfoliating beads in it. The toenail polish was too thick so the finished result was bumpy and uneven. Then I got the bill and it was $105 for a pedicure!! I've never paid that much, even at nice spas where you frankly get so much more. So for $105 I will have to get it redone at home, as my feet still have dry skin and the nail polish doesn't look good. So I decided to let that one go and just enjoy our wonderful stay at the beautiful resort. My husband and I headed to dinner at the Lakehouse. I find it funny that they advertise it as having a view of the \"lake\"....which in my book was a very small pond. Still, it was peaceful and pleasant, and we were looking forward to a fantastic meal. We were presented menus for a four-course fixed-price meal, and that appeared to be the only option. We chose our courses and were waiting for our 2nd course when we heard the table next to us talking about items that we never saw on our menu. Some of them sounded good! So I called one of the servers over to ask if there was a menu that was not presented to us. He promptly told us that it is a menu of \"bar food\" and something that they let the kids order off of. We believed him and finished out our meal. The next day we saw this supposed menu of \"bar food\" and realized it was a regular dinner menu with steak and duck and other items. Although we enjoyed our dinner, we felt deceived that we were only given the one (very expensive) option. The next day we had an incredible day touring wineries, and we returned to the resort to change clothes while our driver waited for us to take us to dinner. They took us up via golf cart to our room, which as we mentioned was at the very top of the resort and quite a hike. We asked the young man to come back in 15 minutes to pick us up, as we would be heading back down to meet our driver. After 15 minutes we started walking, figuring we'd meet him shortly on his way up and hop on for a ride. We got almost all the way to the bottom, at which point my feet were KILLING me in heels, and he drove past us with some other guests. He saw us and said out loud, \"Oh no!\" realizing that he had forgotten to return to get us. I was not a happy camper. A few other comments on the layout of the resort in general....and it's somewhat repetitive to what other reviewers have said. It does seem a bit strange seeing high-end villas set up like row houses. My husband and I paid a little extra to be up at the top and have a little more privacy, but we both commented how happy we were that we did that as the rooms at the bottom of the resort seem to have no privacy. Also, I was a bit surprised at how small the rooms were for the basic 600 sq ft room. I realize now that the 600 sq ft is including the outdoor deck and outdoor shower as \"living space\" which leaves you with a very small master bedroom and bathroom. We expected more for $910 a night. Like I said, I really wanted to love this place. I wanted it to be special for my husband's birthday. The room we had at the Lodge at Pebble Beach was the same price and was far superior with a wood-burning fireplace and a private outdoor jacuzzi. For the money, we will definitely look elsewhere in Napa next time.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cNo lasting impressions!\u201d", "Author": "Irreverent", "ReviewID": "UR116089754", "Content": "I had fond memories of this resort from a previous stay at least 5 years back. Fast forward to July 2011. My brother and sister in law were coming to CA for a 2 week holiday \"up the coast\" from LA. Having not seen them in many years, I offered to treat them to 3 nights at The Ranch as a culmination of their trip. We planned a Mon, Tues, Wed to avoid the weekend. I requested the 2-bedroom Estate Lodge ($3995/night) for the trip. Unfortunately, they couldn't accommodate us on the opening night so we settled for a hillside lodge for me ($910/night) and a 1-bedroom creek lodge for them ($1410/night) for Monday with a move to the Estate Lodge on Tues/Wed. We were psyched for the experience! About 3 weeks prior to arrival I received an email from the concierge requesting whether we were interested in arranging a private tour of wineries not open to the public. About a week later I replied that we were indeed interested, but received no reply. Several days prior to our arrival I emailed the concierge again on the same issue. Radio silence. So before we even arrived I told my brother they were at 4 stars (not 5) due to this oversight. I assumed they would rebound to 5 stars. I was wrong. Picture perfect drive up from the city with an intervening lunch at Bouchon, arriving at the Ranch at 2:00. Neither room was ready upon check in and the concierge was overwhelmed on the phone, so I never got to bring up the lack of response issue directly or with the front desk staff. I did request a call from the manager -- a business associate's parents were acquainted was an additional reason. I never received a call from the manager during the entire stay. I requested the SF Chronicle as my morning paper. I got it the first day in the hillside lodge, but it never followed me to the Estate Lodge. I had to request it both mornings at the Lakehouse for breakfast (only to have a driver bring it up). The perfunctory welcome card in my 1st room was addressed to a different person. Mr \"So & So.\" Oooops. We had a simple late (9:00) dinner at the Lakehouse the first night. Perfect. The next day we got into the Estate Lodge around 4:00. It's at the VERY top of the property which may not be advantageous. Much of the welcome breeze by the pool when it's hot is absent in the upper reaches of the resort and there is no overhead fan (they should add this) in the outdoor common area of the Lodge. Also, this is where the delivery trucks park in the mornings and you get a direct view of the service dock of the restaurant upon leaving the Lodge. Ugh. Once in The Lodge you have privacy and it consists of a kitchen/dining, living, guest & master living units. Unfortunately, if you are relegated to the \"guest\" room as I was, you forfeit the great outdoor shower that was standard in my 1st night \"entry level\" accommodation. I love their simple, but heavy shaded pool area. The oleander have been trained into trees, always in bloom and serving as shade trees. The setting is mostly adults only during the early week even in high season. Low key indeed, but it took exactly 1 hour for a server to approach me during my 2nd full day at the pool. I was nursing the bottle of water I brought from the room all that time. The bell/valet staff were super friendly & efficient. A high point of the experience. But, not without fault. The Estate Lodge comes with access to a complimentary Mercedes and my relatives opted for the E550 convertible for 2 days of wandering throughout the valley while I stayed at the pool. Despite a request to clean the windshield of bugs and/or replace depleted wiper fluid (empty light on), we were always presented with a bug riddled window car. Note to valet: Clean the windshield! BTW. Securing the premier unit on the property does not secure you any additional amenities. No basket, no bubbles, no chocolate, no fresh flowers. You get the same 4 green apples in a bowl, the same complimentary bottle of Calistoga Ranch chardonnay, the same welcome note (addressed to the right person this time). At approximately $13,000 for a 3 night stay, was it worth it? No. Would you go again? Probably not despite the beauty and allure of the place.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cAlways longing to come back - Never wanting to leave!\u201d", "Author": "Asta72", "ReviewID": "UR115693005", "Content": "Rating: A shining 5!

For those of you hesitating in between the \"other\" Auberge resort and this one i can only say one thing, i would pick Calistoga every time. It\u00c2\u00b4s just a fresher, more fun and more up-to-date take on luxury! Location: Secluded and beautifully set in beween \"mountains\" in Calistoga right off the Silverado trail which is gorgeous. Try to avoid the Highway at all times! Room: We had room 103 this time which is a one bedroom spa creek lodge. It\u00c2\u00b4s located near the reception so only a short walk from the pool, but a bit of a hike from the restaurant. Can\u00c2\u00b4t have it all i guess...But they have a lot of speedy buggies so one never has to wait! The way that they have placed all of their accomodations makes that you pretty much can\u00c2\u00b4t go wrong. It\u00c2\u00b4s a very private resort and considering that everyone has their own little lodge it\u00c2\u00b4s also very quiet. The bed is extrememly comfortable!! Large bathroom with his and her sides and a lovely outdoor shower. The only thing in the room that\u00c2\u00b4s not great is the fact that there\u00c2\u00b4s very little storage room for clothes and bags. We also had an outdoor jacuzzi and a separate livingroom area. Another great feature is the fireplace that you can enjoy from both in and outside. Was really perfect to sit next to eat while we had our breakfast outdoors and it was still a bit nippy outside. Another charming thing is all the animals you see from your cabin. Deer, racoons and a huge range of birds! Staff: So very friendly and serviceminded. They are a delight to deal with all of them! Always smiling and always helpful! They are quite a young crowd so the energy is great! Service: See staff above. Can not think of a thing to complain about. Which is rare hahaha But i would like to mention that i even like their turn-down service as they provide such nice and quirky gifts every night. Loved the jelly-beans, massage oil and lavender! Internet: This was the only thing i was not impressed about. It was very spotty depending on where on the property you are. If i, for instance, had not brought my own wireless router i would not have been able to go online at all! BUT i was told that they are in the process to install access points in all the rooms soon so that should be a glitch of the past. Once online it was fast. There\u00c2\u00b4s also no annoying/complicated log-in process which is always smooth + free which is should be everywhere in this day and age! Laundry service: Very good. They even laundered my husbands shirt on the Sunday when there\u00c2\u00b4s normally no laundry service and even managed to deliver it 2 hours before agreed upon! Food: Very good and expensive, especially the breakfast. There\u00c2\u00b4s only one \"proper\" restaurant. But you can order in-room dining at the pool which is always a nice touch. There\u00c2\u00b4s also a restaurant at the pool with lighter, and very fresh, items. There is also a picnic that one can order that has a very nice selection and it\u00c2\u00b4s a charming idea! Amenitites/Minibar/Entertainment: Great amenities for the bathtub! Minibar sufficently stocked. That said, all that is in there upon check-in is also free, great stuff!!! Their movie selection is rather large and you can choose to watch a movie either in the livingroom or the bedroom. Comfort... Giftshop: Don\u00c2\u00b4t expect to get your Pringles and fashion-mag fix there...But hey that\u00c2\u00b4s why there\u00c2\u00b4s a CVS and such not too far away hahah. BUT they do have some very nice and luxurious organic skincare. Plus the usual bikinis and such Spa: Expensive, but very very, very good. We have had several treatments there during our 2nd and 3rd stay stay and were in heaven each time! If you get the chance do the Healing Waters, please do as it\u00c2\u00b4s a very special experience... Doug is btw an excellent massage therapist. Very giving, and very firm touch! Pool: I must confess that it\u00c2\u00b4s not very exciting or large. But you have lovely mountain and forest views from it. Wish there was more shade available once in the water The pool loungers are plentiful and comfortable. Service is as always very pleasant. I especially found Brie charming and super service minded! Gym: There is one, but didn\u00c2\u00b4t use it so can\u00c2\u00b4t comment. Things to see/do: Eat! Drink! Relax! Need i say more...?

It was our first visit to the resort and our first trip back to Napa Valley in approximately 16 years. We live substantially all year in the Scottsdale-Paradise Valley sector of Phoenix, AZ and three months each year in our summer vacation home in Southampton, NY. Because of where we reside, we spend much of our day-to-day lives at world class resorts and spa properties. Over the years, we have travelled fairly extensively throughout the U.S. , the Carribean and Europe (usually at five-star resorts and at luxury boutique properties). Accordingly, our expectations for CR were quite high. We're very pleased to convey that our experience at CR matched, and in many respects exceeded, our highest expectations. For starters, the property is absolutely beautiful - - a serene and stunning amalgam of rustic, natural, elegant and luxurious facilities and accomodations thoughtfully positioned (terraced) in a wooded, pine-fragranced hillside with a small lake and a running creek. The professional staff is exceptionally gracious, volunteering and knowledgeable. We accepted many (breakfast, lunch and dinner) dining suggestions and vineyard tour recommendations from the concierge staff; and there wasn't a single disappointment among them. We stayed (resided) in one of the beautiful private oak creek spa lodges. The rooms are very spacious, comfortable, airy, contemporary and well-appointed . The \"indoor-outdoor\" concept is rather unique, as is the private nature of the entire resort/spa property - - there is absolutely no auto \"thru traffic\" allowed, and the restaurant, spa, fitness center and pool facilities are not accessible to non-guests. This adds to the experience of being a pampered member of an exclusive club - - a home-type atmosphere. Unfortunately, I have certain chronic medical conditions which restrict my ability to indulge in certain cuisine. Fortunately, this was a non-issue during our stay - - the Lakehouse chefs prepared for me numerous \"off-the-menu\" dishes real-time upon my request. The food was beautifully presented and delicious, including the many creative and flavorful appetizers, entres and desserts that my wife was able to enjoy without restriction (I viewed them from afar and enjoyed them vicariously). As part of a cross-sell promotion with local (Napa) Mercedes Benz dealerships, CR maintains on-site and offers its guests for daily use, at no charge on a first-come/first-serve basis, several current model sedans, sports coupes, convertibles and SUVs. We took advantage of this almost every day. This was quite a nice added perquisite. When (not if) we return to Napa Valley (and we're already reviewing our 2012 calendar), we will definitely return to CR. We'd mention the room number (which we'll most certainly request for our return stay), but we do not want to give the readers of this review the opportunity to make the room potentially unavailable when we return :-)) Overall, our experience was romantic, celebratory, relaxing and first class all the way. It was everything we hoped for and needed in terms of suspending the often arduous routine of daily life. It was difficult to leave (notwithstanding how fortunate we are to call Paradise Valley, AZ and Southampton, NY \"home\") We are certain to return to CR and recommend this splendid resort most highly to anyone seeking a truly memorable, stellar vacation experience.

The short version - Go. It is - simply - incredible. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the longer version: The Property: Entire setting is amazing. In the woods/valley, the entire place feels, smells, sounds like retreat should. The pine trees smell amazing and the creek is everything it should be this time of the year. The entire property north of the main lodge is car free. You can either walk or catch a ride with the myriad of attended golf carts. The lack of cars makes the entire venue very relaxed and quiet. All resorts should do this. We rented a Bay Forrest Lodge. It had one bedroom and another 'living' room connected by a covered porch. The wall between the porch and the living room had a double sided gas fireplace. Very nice. One thing to know about the Bay Forrest Lodges (without the outdoor hot tub (spa), is that the road leading up to the 'top' of the property runs behind these particular units. There is a tall fence, but if you are very noise sensitive, you may hear an occasional truck going up the road 'behind' you. IMO, it's not a deal breaker for those units as you might hear 3 trucks in an entire day. The units that this pertains to are 110-120 and are all considered Bay Forrest Lodges. If you want the most serene experience, spring for the Oak Creek Lodges w/ Spa. They are on the other side of the property and have only foot traffic and an occasional golf-cart cruising by. That is the only minor nit in an otherwise epic experience. The Food: We ate breakfast every day at the Lakehouse (on property). The banana/pecan pancakes were so good, we had them every single morning. The dinner there looked very good - and is traditional four course fair - but my wife wasn't feeling like a multi-course meal when we arrived. No trouble, they were happy to make up a hybrid chicken salad for her. We ended up eating at several restaurants off the property, so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment beyond breakfast. The Spa: Best spa setting, service, treatments we have ever experienced. The spa, like the lodging, is not inexpensive. Like the lodging, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth it. Outdoor showers rule. The Service: Every single person that we interacted with at the Calistoga Ranch (and Spa) exhibited not only very 4 star service, but did so with such genuine enthusiasm, that it really made you feel like a very welcomed guest in someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home. They were extraordinarily kind to my wife, who is several months pregnant with our first child. The Team there really is the icing on a magnificent cake. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still talking about \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 we met on-property. Extras: Calistoga Ranch has worked out an arrangement with Mercedes to provide a fleet of cars & SUV for their guests to use. Since we were on-property from Sunday through Saturday, we were able to take great advantage of this very nice extra-perk. Would I go again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in a heartbeat. BTW, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to the other 4.5 star rated properties (via Trip Advisor) in Calistoga and they just aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the same league. The only place I can compare to Calistoga Ranch for overall beauty, service, and experience is the Four Seasons on the Big Island of Hawaii.

So a guest must go outside to access the restaurant, the fitness center, etc. The staff will come with golf carts to transport you and you may prefer to walk. But in the colder weather that is something visitors should be aware of.Third, even the individual units the sleeping and sitting area are not connected and you have to go outside to go from one to the other.

You are in the middle of nature, surrounded by peace and quiet, yet surrounded by unpretentious luxury. It's close to everything wine country has to offer, and yet feels off the beaten track. Our \"room\" felt immense, and was actually two buildings separated by a deck (that had an oak tree growing through the middle of it!). Our deck had a hot tub, which we did not use. Because I have ridiculously sensitive hearing, we asked maintenance to disconnect the heat pump so that we could sleep with the window open and not hear the pump (which is right by the bedroom window). They were really nice about doing that for us. It was lovely to sleep with the windows open -- it felt like we were sleeping outside, being rocked to sleep by the gentle breezes. Sitting out on the deck, listening to the wind move through the trees and gazing up at the stars, was heaven. I'm sure the restaurant was great, but we didn't set foot in it, choosing instead to eat all our meals out on our deck. The two-sided fireplace was lovely to cozy up to, both inside the living room, and outside on the deck. The living room had a wet bar and powder room, and felt elegant and spacious, yet also welcoming and cozy at the same time How do they manage that? I don't know, but it was wonderful. The bed was incredibly comfortable -- down duvets and pillows, and fluffy comfiness all around. Although we travel a lot, I don't tend to sleep well in hotels, but I slept incredibly well here. The bathroom is spacious, and the outdoor shower feels private. If it is too chilly in the morning to shower outside, you can use the shower in the bathtub that separates the two sink areas. Their service was excellent -- really excellent. Everyone was extremely helpful, and went out of their way for us in the most welcoming and genuine way. We had a few small special requests to make (like the spa pump), and felt a little hesitant, not wanting to put anyone out (for instance, we requested an item off the restaurant menu to be delivered to us, instead of ordering completely off the room service menu, which is different). Everyone was incredibly kind, helping us with our requests and truly making us feel like it was no trouble at all. (I hope it really wasn't any trouble.) Sometimes in a fancy hotel, the service is good, but it feels...too fancy or formal. At CR, we felt like we were welcome guests in the home of an incredibly gracious, accommodating host. My husband and I are very lucky to be able to treat ourselves to some very nice hotels from time to time, and but we've noticed that a famous hotel name or a hefty price tag don't always guarantee comfortable beds or sometimes even basic service. The Calistoga Ranch is not just a famous name -- their reputation is well-deserved. Their establishment excels in all the categories that really matter to us, most particularly creature comforts, beauty of the location, and their truly exceptional, friendly service.

Our high expectations were met and we cannot wait to return someday and stay longer than the 3 days we just did. The Ranch is built into the side of a gently sloping hill and is very beautiful and peaceful. You get the sense you are really able to enjoy the outdoors but it comes with an amazing room and great service to boot. The service at the Ranch is top notch. The staff at the poolside bar and restaurant are very friendly as was everybody else we met. The concierge was very helpful with our wine tastings and dinner reservations. There were nice added touches throughout, such as jelly beans left on the bed one night, or a surprise bottle of champagne and a piece of cake that came complimentary as we were celebrating an anniversary. The room was terrific. We had a one bedroom oak creek spa lodge. The bedroom and living area are separated by a large deck with a hot tub. The deck was perfect for enjoying the early morning sunshine or for lounging in front of the indoor/outdoor fireplace late at night after a great meal. We also loved the bathroom and in particular the outdoor shower. One suggestion for them on the room would be to have some more selections in the mini bar. What is in there when you arrive is complimentary which is great, but some liquor would have been a nice touch. To their credit they are very efficient with room service requests for things that aren't already in the fridge. The pool area is pretty nice, not amazing. It's a smaller pool and the ranch does seem to be popular for families with babies and small children so keep that in mind. You will probably hear kids having a good time enjoying the pool if you go. The pool does get great sun all day long and is a very nice setting, as you views of the surrounding hills and nearby vines. The spa is on the small to medium side but very peaceful just like the rest of the place. They have a couple of heated pools and a steam room that we didn't use. The food at the lakehouse restaurant was quite good. It's a lovely setting as well, set up on top of the hill with gorgeous views of a lake and the tree-covered hillside. If you dine as the sun is going down you may see the resident deer that make the place home, including a little one if you're there soon. Like the rest of the ranch the restaurant has an indoor/outdoor atmosphere, but they do have heat lamps setup for when it gets chilly. As for the food, we are lovers of great food and they had some awesome dishes on the menu. The best was an egg yolk pasta with mushrooms and braised rabbit. Frankly amazing. Some other recommendations for your time in Napa: one of the wineries we visited was Swanson, which we really enjoyed. It's a smaller place where we had a more one on one tasting with a woman that has worked there for many years in a really cool room. You have to experience it. We also love Shramsberg, the sparking wine maker. They have a great tour that we've done a couple of times now. And do try to dine at Auberge one night, the most fantastic view we saw all weekend was from their terrace. Though we were here for a short while we were both very sad to leave.

This is such a romantic and cozy time to come to this region. Calistoga Ranch seems to be perfectly located in Napa Valley; easy drives to literally dozens of wineries (both Napa and Sonoma). At the Ranch, everything is new and modern, but maintains a rustic, \"outdoorsy\" charm. There is no shortage of wood burning fireplaces, both outdoors and indoors, with ample sitting space which makes for perfect wine-sipping, book-reading, or time spent just catching up with friends in a really great setting. The property is very spread out, which means calling the golf cart butlers pretty much every time you need to go anywhere... they are usually there in a matter of a couple minutes to take you anywhere you need to go on the property. Located at the base of the property near the lobby, the hotel pool and hot tub is quite stunning and there appears to be enough lounge chairs for everyone (all very nice quality). The fitness facility is half indoors and half outdoors (overlooking the hotel pool) and is really impressive - everything you could want. They have a wide variety of cardio machines, each with their own personal TV, and ample weight lifting machines as well. All equipment is new and state-of-the art; again, *very* impressive fitness facilities. Located on top of the hill of the property (take a golf cart if you're tired!) is the hotel spa. We unfortunately didn't have time to check out the services, but we heard from friends that everything about it was fantastic. For our accommodations, we had one of the least expensive \"lodge rooms\" (all are separate structures); room 136, which was about $750 or so per night (yes, a definite splurge). Our room had a nice large front porch with outdoor fireplace and outdoor furniture which was a really great touch (they hang your morning paper on the door to your porch each morning). Our actual lodge interior was divided in two main spaces: half for the beautiful large bathroom with his and hers sinks and a nice closet and half for the bedroom. This division of space seemed a bit odd as the bedroom was pretty tiny and cramped (but still very nice and well appointed). The bed was great; fantastic linens -- we slept quite well. One of the best things about our lodge (and every lodge, we believe) is the huge outdoor 'rain forest' shower. It's completely private and there are towel hooks and a place for the *amazing* Calistoga bath products...this shower experience is truly one of the best things about each lodge, especially when it's a little cold out. If you're not into it, never fear as there is a regular shower and bath inside each lodge, as well. Room 136 is especially nice if you're attending a wedding at Calistoga as the reception Wine Cave and the main hotel restaurant are literally 20 feet from your doorstep. All in all, a very nice lodge, but the living/sleeping quarters were definitely cramped. The only meals we ate at Calistoga were breakfasts and they were a solid 9 out of 10. Service at the restaurant was great and the ambiance and view overlooking the valley of Calistoga was beautiful. NB: order up a plate of \"well done crispy bacon\" and you won't regret it. Service, in general, at Calistoga was a solid 9 out of 10. They lost half a point in two areas: a) again, because the property is so vast (and steep), you'll need to rely on the golf cart drivers to take you from here to there...they are usually timely, but about a third of our calls for a ride took several minutes which was a little frustrating (perhaps they were understaffed?) and b) the friends we were traveling with had a frustrating check-in process...their room wasn't ready when we arrived (the hotel check-in time is technically 4:00...however, because the rest of the wedding party's rooms were ready, this was also frustrating and it would have been nice if the hotel offered them a complimentary glass of wine or something to ease the blow after a 6 hour flight and 2 hour drive). The Ranch did have a very high standard of service in all other areas and one to make special note of would be the concierge staff. Greg, in particular, helped line us up with a wonderful wine tour of Quintessa, Opus and Clos du Val chauffeured by \"Gia,\" with a stop at the Oakville Grocery Store and it was a very memorable day (NB: Ask Greg to mention another winery called \"Constant;\" it's also one of his favorites and sounds spectacular). All in all, we are very happy with our choice to stay at Calistoga Ranch for this trip to Napa. The other super luxe resort in this region would be Calistoga's sister property, the famous Auberge du Soleil, about 20 minutes from Calistoga, which is also supposed to be fabulous [NB: For those not wanting to spend quite so much, I'd highly recommend checking out The Villagio Inn & Spa 10 minutes away in Yountville, where I have also stayed -- beautiful property at a much lower price point].", "Date": "November 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, N.Y.", "Title": "\u201cExpensive but well worth it\u201d", "Author": "sandan93", "ReviewID": "UR10089566", "Content": "Stayed at Ranch 10/5-10/8.

The wireless internet access on the deck area was free and super for sending e-mails home to make everyone jealous. We were not planning to bring our dog but circumstances were such that she came. She was treated like royalty with a special bed, bowls and collar tag waiting when we got to the room. The service was impeccable and we wanted for nothing.

This is close to a 5 star resort with only few problems to correct. However, their main problem cannot be easily corrected as they are under major construction to add more private owned 'rooms.' I would suggest that they find time in the fall & winter to work longer shifts than during high season of summer. We were in room 124 which was far enough away from the construction but we were located next to a bridge which you could hear the golf carts traveling over (even at 10:30 at night.) The Pros - very friendly staff, always had our car started, top down with cold bottles of water inside, and/or air conditioning running. The restaruant 4 course meal with the package was one of the finest we have ever had. Again the staff was very good and the restaraunt was quiet that evening. We also received a dessert from the chief with 'Happy Anniversary' spelled out in choclate on the plate . The grounds were impecable with bikes to use for free, hiking paths and bocci ball. The rooms with the connecting deck and outdoor furniture was very unique. The beds and towels were fluffy and the outdoor shower was incredible. The decor and audio systems were very nice. The indoor/outdoor fireplace and private hot tub on the deck was also very nice and used often. Our room was ready when we arrived at 4:00 (although we heard other people's rooms were not) - an hour after arrival we received a complimentary bottle of champagne and dessert for our anniversary. All room service was quick and accurate and food is great. Fridge was stocked daily with complementary beverages and bottle of wine. Room service very good. Cons - the outdoor furnture cushions were very stained/dirt. There were many young kids in the pool all day when we were at the pool - for $1300/night I don't want high pitched screams and splashing. The service at the pool (on Monday afternoon) lacked severly, young kids serving - very disapointing. I was very annoyed when the waiter at the pool was pushing us to finish our food and sign the bill by 5:30 when the pool service is open until 6:00. We had to go to the bar 2/3 times to get our drinks. Much traffic on the main path through the resort to the restaurant during the day. Some servers to the room didn't speak much english. Next to the bed there was a breakfast order menu of which we filled out every evening and hung by the door. At check out we find out that we are charged for the breakfast - and there were no prices listed on the order menu!! We figured breakfast was included in the $1300/night fee. I told the front staff repeatedly that you cannot offer breakfast service/any menu showing no prices and make customers pay - but they didn't do anything. All other dinner and beverage menus in the rooms showed prices. All in all one of the top resorts we have been to - we have been to Broadmoor, Peter Island, Ritz-Carlton... We really like the Calistoga area and will return to the area but not the Calistoga Ranch until construction is finished or they offer very reduced rates.

I loved the outdoor shower - very romantic. The restaurant served excellent food. The spa massage therapists were awesome - very knowledgeable and caring to your needs. The restaurant and spa are supposedly for resort guests only, which keeps the priority for the guests. What I didn't like was how our deck faced the front of the units, and not in the back like I had imagined. Also, the bedroom windows were large but also faced the front. That lack of privacy was a little disappointing. It kind of defeated the purpose for me and for why I paid the high rates. Another problem for me, which wasn't major, was that I didn't know that the resort was pet-friendly until I got there. I have allergies to certain animals. Although our room did not appear to have any animal hair or odor, many pet owners did not keep the animals on a leash and think that everyone is ok with that. I have kids, but I still don't like when people don't control their children. Why should pets be any different. Not everyone is comfortable with animals, especially when allergies are involved.

We booked the most expensive accomodations at the resort for two evenings and were placed in the Creek room closest to the bridge to the active construction area. We were livid to wake to the beeps of backing construction equipment, the rumble of large trucks across the bridge and, worst of all, a bulldozer left idling unattended outside our bedroom window, still on the \"guest\" side of the bridge. Needless to say this was completely unacceptable and would never happen at another resort of Calistoga's quality and price range, Post Ranch Inn for example. To the resort's credit, they gave us an extra 30 minutes on our massages and moved us to the Estate Lodge for the second of our two nights, which we appreciated, but the point of coming to Calistoga is to relax and not have to be bothered with the outside world for a day or two. Unfortunately, on this visit, I still found myself having to resort to very direct conversations with senior people at the resort before a very obvious problem was resolved that should never have occurred in the first place. We were disappointed on our first visit to the resort with the noise and traffic outside our room on the high side of the road and so we booked at the creek side (at a higher price), only to find ourselves closer to the lodge construction. We won't return, if ever, until construction is complete. Bottom line is the resort needs to seriously reexamine its approach to noise and traffic, including truck traffic past the lodges to the restaurant. Until then, you can do much better pretty much anywhere for $1000 per night.", "Date": "May 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palo Alto, California", "Title": "\u201cMixed impression\u201d", "Author": "northerncalifornia71", "ReviewID": "UR7487185", "Content": "We just returned from a three night stay at Calistoga Ranch. Bottom line: this is a nice enough property, but for $1100. per night we expected much, much more. Pros: The design of the room was basically pleasing, with finishes in slate and wood that are very complementary to the canyon. The outdoor shower in particular was a real treat...very relaxing. I agree with another posting that the furniture is rather standard, with the one exception being the very comfortable bed. The spa is excellent, with a nice open-air layout and well-placed soaking pools and lounge chairs. I had a massage and facial, and the facial was outstanding. Sharon has excellent skills and is highly knowledgeable about organic products. The Lakehouse restaurant is very good. Nice design and decor, friendly staff. Menu somewhat limited for a vegetarian, but our meal was excellently prepared and presented. Excellent valet service...our car was pulled up quickly with our advance call and valets always helpful. Cons: The layout of the property is reminiscent of a condominium complex, with \"units\" closely spaced and a non-high-end/homogenous look and feel. Not offensive, but not especially pleasing....strange choices, given all the design options available today. This could be relatively unnoticeable if the property was committed to outstanding service and attention to detail, but the staff has not trained at high enough standards to overcome the limitations in layout and design. We had specifically asked for a room with a nice view, and ended up with a view of the golf cart path up the center of the property. Not only was this less than pleasing, but we could easily hear the constant flow of cart traffic as well as continual conversations among the housekeeping and room service staff. Really disruptive if you would like to hear the birds or just enjoy some quiet. We asked to move immediately upon arrival and were told it was not possible due to high occupancy. No affirmation was given of our original request for a view, and in fact we were emphatically reminded that our confirmation indicated a Forest room vs. a Creek room and that basically we should have known that a Forest room doesn't have a comparable view. Disappointing reaction from the staff, to say the least. And no follow up on the subject on subsequent nights; no offer to move toward the end of the weekend. Any gesture from management would have been appreciated. Again, this is an $1100. per night experience. The living room furniture was downright uncomfortable. We like to end the day with a glass of wine and a chat, maybe a little reading, and we found ourselves shifting constantly due to the uncomfortable sofa and chair. Towels were very rough...noticeably so. I am surprised that this still stands out in my mind! Room service breakfast was high quality but inferior in service/delivery. On two of the three mornings we ordered meals, we had to call back for corrections that were not minor. Staff should have better training in response time and English language. The hot water kettle in our bar did not function correctly, and no replacement was given after three separate requests during our stay. Also, we repeatedly asked for extra ginger ale in our minibar, but none ever materialized. The housekeeper arrived once while we were there to restock the minibar, but the dispatcher had not taken the time to distinguish between our specific request and a basic restocking request. Furthermore, the housekeeper told us we could only have one can of ginger ale at a time. More training is obviously needed in this area. Service at the pool area is very spotty, nonexistent as the day progresses past mid afternoon. Dirt was tracked into our living room on several occasions...looked like coffee grounds, and immediately noticeable upon our return to the room in the afternoons. Lastly, and in our opinion likely indicative of the overall management philosophy, there was no action on behalf of the management or staff that made us feel especially acknowledged or welcomed. Everyone was basically friendly, but we left feeling like a more thoughtful reception and experience can be had at your standard Ritz or Four Seasons, not to mention similarly priced Northern California properties like the Post Ranch Inn in Big Sur. We had given some personal details during the reservation process that easily could have been acted upon to make our experience better than average.

My wife and I love travel. We love Inns and we love B&B's and we love Hotels. We've stayed in cheapo hotels that we've loved and we've stayed in luxury hotels that we've loved. The key, I believe, to loving a restaurant or hotel or shop is value. We can love a $2 taco at El Metate like we love the $18 foie gras at Gary Danko...but if El Metate's tacos were $18 or Gary Danko's foie appetizer were $50 we'd say \"What the...?\" This was our problem with Calistoga Ranch. Value for the money. At $200/night, our stay would have been fabulous. At their prices, it was an outrage. It all started off well enough...(wavy blur as we experience a flashback). On their web site, the rooms sounded amazing. The private \"spa\" lodges offer 1200 sq. ft. of space, indoor-outdoor fireplaces off the living room, a private deck w/a hot tub and a bedroom w/a huge bath and an outdoor shower. Wow! Sounds amazing, huh? We thought so. Perhaps even enough so to warrant the $800+ per-night rate. This was our anniversary and we were excited to go there. We'd been planning it for a while and I had even spoken with the sommelier at their restaurant, The Lakehouse, days in advance to request that they bring two glasses of champagne to the table right after we were seated at our dinner there, the night we arrived. This was just a little surprise gesture for my wife. When we arrived, the property looked amazing. You cross a pretty wooden bridge and drive up to their lodge-like office, built of natural wood and stone, with a lovely outdoor lounge area with a roaring wood fire, drinks, and newspapers available. The property is valet-only, so we had to leave our car and be driven in a golf cart to our room...which we declined since our room was perhaps 100 feet from the office door. The valet staff were responsive, pleasant, and helpful and one gentleman brought our bags to the room and showed us around our lodge. Walking in the gate to our lodge, you enter the deck, with a trellis overhead and dividing the indoor living room space to the left and the bedroom space to the right. The deck was spacious and looked out over trees - very peaceful. The hot tub was over by the right edge of the deck, right outside the door to the bedroom. Sounds romantic, huh? Well, the hot tub was private, in that only we had keys to our room, but it looked out over three other lodges and right below the open railing next to the hot tub was the Ranch's Bocce Court. Private? Are we going to get naked and frolick in our \"private\" tub while other guests wave from their lodges or toss the bocce balls below us and wink knowingly? I don't think so. Large room.......check Private deck.......well, there's a deck, but it's not private Private hot tub...well, there's a tub, but it's definitely not private What next? Oh yeah, the fireplace. There was an indoor-outdoor fireplace, but it was both completely behind glass on both sides and was strictly a gas fireplace. Don't get me wrong. I'm not against gas fireplaces. They're great at the Lodge at Sonoma for $179/night or Santa Fe's Inn of the Anasazi at $250/night, but for $800/night, I'd expect a real, wood-burning fireplace. Gas just doesn't say \"top-of-the-line\". The furniture in the rooms was simple and pleasant, but more Marriott than Auberge. The floors in the bedroom creaked and squeaked - something you'd expect in a 100 year-old B&B but not in a newly-built lodge that charges more than any other hotel in wine country. The heating system blew so loudly that we had trouble sleeping at night - a contrast with the Hotel Andalucia in Santa Barbara where we stayed a few weeks later (for about a quarter the price) and where the HVAC system was so quiet we had to check to make sure that it was on. The DVD player in the bedroom, which my wife tried to use for her yoga DVD, rattled like an idling Harley motorcycle and failed to deliver an image to the screen...something they might have checked out before we checked in. The food, both at their restaurant and in the room (for breakfast), was excellent. Kudos to their kitchen. But when we did go to their restaurant for dinner...the champagne that I had requested from the sommelier for when we sat down was conspicuously absent. I didn't want to remind them at the time because the gesture was all about having thought of it ahead of time, not at the moment. No big deal. But at the end of the meal, after having ordered glasses of white, red and dessert wines, they brought the Champagne. Arrunnnhhh? What was up with that? Who has Champagne at the end of the meal? And was this the champagne I had requested or some oddly-timed gesture of the house? We checked our detailed bill upon checkout and...yep, they charged us for the champagne that didn't come when we had requested it and did come after we were done with the meal. On the bright side, they didn't argue when we asked that they take it off the bill when we explained that it didn't come when requested - we were just sad that in such an expensive and highly-rated hotel that the gaff should have happened in the first place. My wife tried their spa and felt that it did deliver on its pricey promise...even to the point of being extraordinary. Since you can go there without staying at the hotel, perhaps that's the ticket. Net net...this is an attractive hotel that would be a \"perfect\" getaway in wine country for $300/night. At $800/night, it's a ripoff. There are dozens of places with real fireplaces and lovely views at half the price.

We pulled up to the property and we loved the fact that it was very removed from one of the main roads. We arrived with an extra guest and could no longer stay in one of the deluxe rooms--the staff was very accomodating and found a one bedroom suite so that we could all stay comfortably. The room wasn't ready, but our pre-arranged driver for wine tasting was--so off we went! When we finished our tasting tour with Bob from Prestige Limo--we were escorted to our lodge with a glass of complimentary wine in one hand and the most delicious hot chocolate in the other. We arrived at our lodge, which was made up of two separate cottages, at night. Both cottages were beautiful with a shared deck and an indoor/outdoor fireplace. The den cottage had a pull -out sofa (which was extremely comfortable for a pull-out), bar with complimentary everything except the hard liquor and beer, and a half bath. The other cottage had a king-size bed that was uber-comfortable and a great, huge bathroom (plus outdoor rain shower that was awesome!). We were even more excited the next morning when we woke up and really took in the surroundings. You really feel as though you are one with nature. It's beautiful and invigorating. We ate at The Lakehouse restaurant. It is is on the small side, but the food was good and they were extremely accomodating (especially for my wife who has a ton of serious food allergies.)

The absolute best feature is the outdoor shower, located on a separate, private deck off the master bathroom (though here is also an indoor shower and tub if you prefer). The service was exemplary. Shortly after we arrived, we received a note from the manager wishing us a happy anniversary, along with a bottle of champagne and a chocolate cake! In addition, whenever we called for any type of service, our needs we met within minutes. For example, my husband called the front desk late the first night and told them he had left his prescription medicine in our car, which had been parked by the valet (valet parking is included). Not five muinutes later, his medicine was delivered to our door. There are shuttles (golf carts) buzzing along the roads constantly, so you can always catch a ride to wherever you want to go on the resort. Towels are changed twice daily. Turndown service on the first night included a box of locally handmade chocolates, and a bottle of massage oil the second night. My husband and I both had massages at the Bathhouse spa - although I choked a bit on the prices at first, I have to admit it was an hour of pure bliss. The massage therapists did an excellent job. There are warm and cool pools to soak in before or after the treatment, and the changing room/showers have everything you could possibly need afterwards, from toothpaste and deodorant to combs and hairdryers. We had breakfast and dinner at the Lakehouse restaurant on-site, with excellent food and service both times. The restaurant has a nice deck with a view over a small lake. Lunch is served at the bar by the pool, and was also very tasty. The poolside service was great - one afternoon it was very hot and the staff offered us cold towels in buckets of ice to cool down. If you are ready for a splurge, this is the place to do it. This is the ultimate romantic getaway!", "Date": "July 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coral Gables, Florida", "Title": "\u201cCalistoga Ranch -- Well Worth It\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5447852", "Content": "We stayed at Calistoga Ranch in late June of 2006 for four nights. The overall trip was truly memorable. Upon arrival we were upgraded from a deluxe lodge to a forest lodge. I believe that the Ranch has many more of the forest lodges than the deluxe lodges and that may have been a reason why we were upgraded. The forest lodge is compromised of two rooms: (1) the bedroom and bathroom -- with a king size bed, a large bathroom with double sinks, a shower/tub and an outside shower; (2) the second room is a living room with a sofa, two chairs, a bar, another bathroom and a fireplace. I believe the two units combined are somewhere around 1100 square feet. The fireplace is indoor/outdoor. The two rooms are connected by an outdoor living space with two chairs, a table and access to the fire place. It was a really unbelievable space that created a feeling of relaxation. The service was excellent. We recieved a complimentary bottle of wine (Calistoga Ranch Chardonnay) the first night. On the second night we received a bottle of Vueve Clequot Champagne. On the third night we received a cheese tasting plate. In addition to this, all of the non-alcoholic beverages in the mini-fridge are complimentary as well as all of the snacks. The staff at Calistoga Ranch was great; overall they appeared extremely young -- they were all personable and accomodating. The pool was extremely nice; not a huge pool, but extremely relaxing -- a bar is located above the pool area; the service in the pool area was again great. The resort was 95% full the four nights we stayed there according to numerous staff members, but it certaintly did not feel that way. Because of the way that Calistoga Ranch was developed -- with individual lodges, you really never run into other guests unless you go to the pool, restuarant or spa. I thought it was extremely well designed that way and never felt crowded. We went to the restaurant the Lakehouse for dinner. The food was very good and the wine list was interesting. The service at the restaurant was very good. I thought the overall experience there was above average, but probably not on par with some of the unbelievable restuarants in the Napa/Sonoma area. If you are expecting French Laundry this does not compare, but it shouldn't. For what it is though, a really great resort restaurant. The spa was relaxing. My wife and I had a treatment there. The spa was somewhat small, but I did not feel crowded. I do not have spa treatments regularly, so I am probably not the best person to judge the spa. Overall I thought that the treatment was relaxing and reasonably priced. Although Calistoga Ranch is expensive, for the many hotels and resorts in the area, I believe for what you get it is reasonably priced. The experience was the most relaxing I have ever had on vacation and I can't imagine better service. It is a much different experience than your run of the mill hotel; it really creates a feeling of being at an up-scale summer camp. You have the opportunity to hike right outside your front door and there is unbelievable foilage everywhere you look. In addition its location is excellent -- not in a busy area -- off of the Silverado Trail near St. Helena. Easy access to Napa and to Sonoma. I travel a lot for work and stay at many nice hotels and resorts throughout the country and abroad (i.e. Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental). Calistoga Ranch not only matched but exceeded in many respects the quality and service that you should expect at these establishments. Highly recommended.", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, New York", "Title": "\u201cVery Relaxing\u201d", "Author": "beachbug", "ReviewID": "UR5383126", "Content": "Just returned from a three night stay and overall I was extremely impressed. We had one glitch, which I will note below, but otherwise my experience there was superb. Resort and Rooms: I stayed in a deluxe lodge and I think I really lucked out in terms of location. The size of the indoor living space was a little small, but the large bathroom and outdoor living space more than made up for this. It is so beautiful there that you will want to spend most of your time outdoors anyway. The resort itself does an amazing job of making the most of its natural location and the outdoor fireplace and shower were a very nice touch. My lodge was located near the restaurant and spa which was great, because we could just walk to these places. Pool area was another highlight of the resort. It was the perfect size. I never felt like I was at a mega resort although the weekend I was at the Ranch there happened to be a wedding and it became apparent that the pool area may have been understaffed. Otherwise the pool service was terrific and the lounge chairs were very comfortable. Restaurant: I only had dinner once at the restaurant and breakfast there once. The staff was very attentive, even bringing us free champagne when they heard it was my birthday. The portions at dinner are small but I found them to be quite filling. I am not a big eater and I can see where someone with a more hearty appetite might come away unsatiated. Breakfast was especially good and we also loved room service. Our deck was so nice that half the time we didn't want to go anywhere else to eat. Spa: I had the \"Traditional\" at the spa and overall I enjoyed it. The person I went with had the same and we both felt that the spa was above-average, although maybe not exceptional. I loved the indoor/outdoor treatment rooms and the view from the relaxation area, but I could see where the space is not that large and if it was fully booked it could become uncomfortable. Overall I would recommend a treatment there, just because if you are spending this much money to stay some place you might as well try the spa. It will enhance the experience. Service: Service was exceptional. Everyone goes out of their way to please you, except we had one glitch when we checked out. For the entire duration of our stay the men who escorted us to our lodge on the golf carts would always pull up the hill in front of our lodge and drop us at the stairs. They did this when they checked us in with our luggage and every time thereafter. On the morning of checkout they refused to pick us up on top of the hill and the individual at the front desk told me that the five other individuals that had been shuttling us back in forth the entire time were not supposed to bring the golf cart all of the way up and that they would not pick us up there. This may not be a problem for most people, but I was travelling with a senior citizen and we ended up having to carry most of our own luggage down the hill, because not only had they refused to pick us up at the top of the hill, but they seemed to forget that we were checking out even though we told them multiple times. I am not someone who expects staff to cater to her every whim, but at these prices I also would not have expected them to refuse to do something they had been doing along. I have to say I found the attitude of the individual at the desk that morning to be just not fitting with the rest of the staff at the resort, but I think that person may just have been an outlier. The morale of this story is if you are travelling with an older individual or someone who may have some type of physical disability you may want to double check the location of your lodge and both the number of hills and stairs to where they will drop you in a golf cart. Other than that the trip was terrific and I really loved the Ranch. It is the perfect place if you want to totally get away and enjoy the vineyards or even just nature.", "Date": "June 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cDynamite Joint!\u201d", "Author": "stevieNewYork", "ReviewID": "UR4740342", "Content": "Fantastic place, beautifully appointed, friendly, hard working and caring staff.

The suites are luxurious, comfortable and private. We had an Oak Creek suite which was very private. My sense is that some are considerably more private than others. The beds are super comfortable and we enjoyed three nights of blissful sleep. The setting itself in the valley is amazing. The hills surrounding the resort give a feeling of isolation and remoteness from the outside world. The hotel has a hiking trail above the valley that is a MUST do! We were the only couple we saw using the trail in the 3 days we visited and we were so happy that we did it. Please try it, you will note be disappointed. The views are spectacular. Service was good and the restaurant was excellent, although we found the wine list to be surprisingly light and very expensive. There are restaurants with much deeper wine lists in the area. They need to work on this point. The other problem we had, is that there is no area to relax other than your room. There is no lounge area to get a coffee or snack. You have to go to the small bar area at the restaurant. Not ideal... All in all a superb resort.

I was very impressed with the property. They certainly took care to make the rooms as private as possible by the enclosures around the private decks and the foliage.

The suites were enormous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I have never stayed in such an expansive room before! We did not take full advantage of the living room area, but it was nice it was there.

However due to the success of the owners lodges (time share model) they built 6 more of this big suite houses and i guess when they are finished it could drift into a high end campground flair, if the hotel management is not watching the expansion carefully. After this last 6 suite expansion they definatly should stop to prevent the downgrade of style and hideaway charme. Here is a advise for those who like to stay at the suite and just relax. DO NOT TRY ROOMSERVICE FOR DINNER. Even you get a complimentory estate chardonnay, they forgot to bring new glasses for a new ordered high price wine ( hey, we are in the wine country, and i guess they should know all about tasting ). Also the food ( fish super small, low taste, high price ) is not worth mentioning. So i recommend to go the extra mile for the estate restaurant ( reservation recommended) and get excellant food and service there.
