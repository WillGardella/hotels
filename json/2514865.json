Buses are easy and stops are many and the views brilliant. The hotel is very quiet and in a quiet location as between main steets and this one isn't busy. Due to the street width and buildings other street traffic not noticeable. The bedrooms are quiet and very comfortable and well furnished. My room had a pleasant view of other parts of the hotel, the architecture being such it couldn't help but be nice. It was very hot in Paris in the day but could be cool at night so the air conditioning was a great bonus at any time. Lovely sppacious bathroom with good shelf around basin and decent lighting. Fairly good hanging but more for 1 plus than 2. Safe in room which is necessary to put passport, spare cash, etc. Good mirror on door. Comfortable bed and nice as I discovered I had a double. No garish light as those overhead were small ones all around and then bedside ones if you wished. Good to have a lift because I cannot cary a case with any ease and, after a leg operation I am not too happy on winding staircases, pretty ones or not! Sometimes the staff were female so they wouldn't be too happy carrying your case. The staff are lovely and speak good English should this be required. Breakfast is a buffet, not too much choice but good and there is a toaster! You get a pot of coffee or tea instead of the usual cup only. The decor is lovely and a little quirky - mostly antiques plus a very old piano, which works. Some cased collections such as a model of a sailing ship, some rather lovely Venetian Carnival masks and one framed carnival head with a whirl of sheet music around her. The lamps are also very interesting - go and see! Arc de Triomphe two minutes away herefore Champs Elysee, 20 to Eiffel tower and 15 to concert hall Salle Pleyel (reason for trip) which is on rue du Faubourg St. Honore and therefore near to elegant shopping. Restaurants are about but not plentiful and some food outlets - boulangerie and fruit shop but after all this is a residential area. As such this is an attraction because it is quiet. 24 hour bar but a snack or two would be nice. No large coffee after 8pm only espresso. Beware - all French drinks - any kind - are pricey not so much here but everywhere else. Kettle, coffee, tea and a biscuit in bedroom. Free wi-fi. Television but not excellent choice of channels - could do with a radio. Good for gettting from airport as Airfrance bus right by Arc and near hotel. Distance from Garde du Nord (Eurustar - my train) easy and taxi not pricey and pleasant drivers who are good too. (Bus drivers are excellent too - some sttreets are very narrow.) All-in-all a nice hotel, good area with ease of getting around and worth staying there. I had a good 4 nights. Although it is part of a group - all delightful hotels by the look of the brochure - it is more like a well-run private establishment and you feel at home.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and breakfast\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR126819834", "Content": "Very friendly staff-didn't revert to speaking English if guests struggled with French-always a plus.

Thanks to all previous reviewers. We did request a view which my son (I traveled with a 7 year old) loved. It has the best location of all the hotels we've stayed in Paris (3x's) and the nicest ambience. It had a terrific bath that we relaxed in after our travels and the front desk was very nice. The breakfast service was outstanding and the men that worked the service there did an outstanding job of caring for the area and keeping it spotless. Our room wasn't big but it was typical Paris standard and we slept like babies and were very comfortable. The only 3 things I would say that were different was 1) the big key (and you leave it at the front desk when you leave for the day) that you use was a bit cumbersome. 2) You need to turn the main switch on by the door for anything to work. 3) Remember that you are on the right side of the Arc (we messed up the first night and went to the left side from the main street Champ Ellese). We highly recommend the Red or Green buses for sightseeing as their tickets are good for 2 days and takes you to the main points of interest. We to the Red (Rouge) bus and were very satisfied with the service (we never waited but 3 minutes for a bus). It was a new way for us to explore the city and though there is quite a bit of traffic, you still see more above ground than underground/Metro (which can be quite smelly). We took the Air France bus to the hotel which was very convenient for the airport and we only walked one short block to our hotel. My favorite part of this hotel was the wonderful feel/look of it but that we had everything that anyone could want and a wonderful breakfast ready for us in the morning. They also serve breakfast until 10:30am which helped, as we did sleep in one day and still could grab some coffee, fruit and pastry before heading out. The front desk person (a man) spoke very good English and was most helpful. He helped us out with using the business center since I was not good at tapping into the free internet. 5 stars for making our trip very comfortable!

Travel to and from both airports is super easy via the Air France shuttle, for which the hotel sells tickets. Metro stop located a block or two away. CONS: Some street noise, but this is present in most Paris hotels and the windows are well insulated. Those piercing French police sirens, though, definitely make their way into rooms on Mac Mahon, even when the window is closed. Didn't bother us that much -- one doesn't go to Paris for peace and quiet. Consider if this neighborhood matches what you want from your Paris vacation. It is safe and near the Arc and Champs-Eysees, but beyond those two things (which are low on my list of favorite attractions), neighborhood personality is lacking. The streets around the Arc are larger and there is an enormous roundabout surrounding the Arc, so this neighborhood does not have as much of the charm of the small, cafe-lined streets one pictures when they think of Paris. It's definitely not a bad location at all, especially given the safety and numerous transit options, but the other neighborhoods we visited on the Left Bank were more charming.

Hotel C\u00e9cilia is situated on Avenue Mac-Mahon (an architecturally attractive street) and is only a block or so from the Arc de Triomphe and the Metro. It is a small hotel with a stylish entrance, lobby and bar/sitting area that evoke an elegance one ordinarily would not expect from a three-star hotel in Paris. Our rooms overlooked Mac-Mahon and offered a nice side view of the Arc de Triomphe from our balconies. Traffic noise was not a problem at all at any time of the day or night. While a bit on the small side compared with American hotels, our rooms had ample walking, closet and storage space and decent-sized bathrooms. The d\u00e9cor of the rooms was not as stylish as the common areas on the first floor, but they were still nicely wall-papered and painted. The bed was comfortable and there were extra blankets if needed. The hotel staff could not have been better. They were very polite and engaging and were especially helpful in directing us to restaurants that were off the n . We will visit Paris again and, when we do, we likely will return to Hotel C\u00e9cilia.

Like all other restaurants where we ate in Paris and elsewhere in France, it offers two or three fixed price dinners that are drawn from its a la carte menu. Le hide is small and sparsely decorated but has good personalized service and offers very good traditional French cuisine with a bit of an Asian infusion. Also try Bistro Melrose (5 place de Clichy)- about a 15 to 20 minute walk from the funicular serving Sacr\u00e9 Coeur.

There is quite a bit of noise from the road at night however and this is a bit offputting. Our room had a balcony which could be an issue for a large child climbing but a 2 year old was not able to slip under it or climb it. The breakfast was good and staff very helpful/friendly. We stayed 4 nights and the breakfast is the same every morning which gets a bit boring but quality was good. I found the quality of the coffee to be of a poor standard - very week perhaps not filter coffee but granulated nescafe variety, the tea was better but the milk is not at all like Irish/UK milk - much weaker.

The bar/lounge area is very nice and we would have liked to sit down there and chat with other guests but it seems nobody makes use of the area in the evenings and I think it is due to the very high bar prices, why try and sell at high prices and get no customers? sell drinks cheaply and people would stay around and have a drink and create a nice atmosphere and it would be a nice refuge from the rest of high priced Paris to return to after a meal at a restaurant nearby.

Location wise it was great, right near the Arc De Triumph and about a 3-4 min walk from the nearest metro (which also happens to have the RER go through there, fantastic if you are coming from the airport or from Gard du nord) The hotel staff were very friendly and spoke quite good English when my limited French stopped working! I booked through their hotel and asked for a street facing room on a high floor. We ended up with a street facing hotel (so you can see the Arch from the balcony) on the top floor so was very impressed with that. The room itself was quite small (no surprises there) but the bathroom was HUGE (if very dated as it looks like it was built / renovated in the 60's, 70's). Both the bathroom and bedroom were VERY clean and kept very professionally clean by the staff. Even though the website says \"Satellite TV\" is included, there is only 1 channel in English and that was CNN news. The hotels website also said that there was free internet but it was broken the whole time we were there and there was a card in the room saying you had to pay for the internet (so I am not sure if it was free or not). Breakfast was actually very nice with a great spread of fresh fruit salad, cold meats (ham etc) pastries, cereal, juices etc. I was expecting something a little less tasty so was pleasantly surprised. There is a shop just around the corner that is open late (we went there at 11:30pm) that has the basic coke, wine, snacks etc so that is very handy! (go out the front door, turn left, go to the first street and turn left, its on the right about 100 m down) All in all I would highly recommend Hotel Cecilia for a short stay in Paris when on a budget!", "Date": "November 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "scotland", "Title": "\u201cMade our holiday.\u201d", "Author": "ScotlandAndrew", "ReviewID": "UR48226947", "Content": "Excellent staff, very helpful,accomodating and friendly. close to all tourist attractions,well within walking distance,surrounded by local cafes/restaurants which made our holiday.", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Service": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cSuperb!\u201d", "Author": "Bambewhistle", "ReviewID": "UR48226476", "Content": "I spent one night here in Room 33, a well sized room for the two of us (neither of us felt it was small), lovely bathroom (combined shower/bath, very good actually) which was generously sized and we had a balcony overlooking the street from where you could easily see the Arc de Triomphe.

I stayed here on the strength of the reviews on this site and I was not disappointed. While the room was small and the hotel does not have some of the extras of a higher star rated hotel, the excellent value, location and assistance of the staff more than compensates for the lack of luxury that a higher class hotel may have. As mentioned in many other reviews, the location is excellent. The hotel is one street over from the Metro, the train line and the Air France shuttle bus service that takes anyone (not just Air France passengers) into Paris for a small fee. The Metro station happens to be the point where at least 2 of the main lines through the parts of Paris that most tourists would want to see. So, it is only a 10-minute metro ride to the Eiffel Tower, Louvre and island on which Notre Dame and St. Chappelle are located. Plus, the hotel is literally a short walk to the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs D'Elysse for some good shopping and people watching. The staff is very good and all speak excellent English. One evening we asked for a dinner recommendation and were given 2 local restaurants within 2 blocks of the hotel. The dinner at LeHide was perhaps the best we had in Paris and the rest of our stay in Cannes. So, I recommend asking for LeHide, which is on the same block as this Hotel, just around the corner on the opposite side of a little side street. We had a 2-course meal for 2, with 2 glasses of wine for under 80 euro, which for an authentic meal in Paris is a great price.

We had no idea even with her positive recommendation that we would be as pleased with the hotel as we were. The location was perfect. The rooms were great and the bathrooms very large and modern. The staff could not have been more helpful with their restaurant recommendations and general info about transportation and the things that first-time travelers to an area needed. The first 3 of our 4 to arrive did not speak French but it was not a problem. We checked out of the Cecilia on Sunday morning after 2 nights to travel to southern France but had made reservations for the night before we were to leave as we were flying out of Charles de Gaulle airport. They allowed us to leave luggage that we did not need in their storage area while we were gone. When we returned on Wednesday afternoon, they handed us our keys, asked about our trip and immediately told us where to find our rooms - no signatures required. We opted for the breakfast buffet which was really great: coffee, assortment of juices, croissants, yogurts, fruit, cheese, jellies and jams, toast... We could not have asked for more.", "Date": "November 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Ireland", "Title": "\u201cLaundry room?\u201d", "Author": "barbara_hackett", "ReviewID": "UR20437087", "Content": "My husband and I have just returned from a three night stay in Hotel Cecilia , Paris for my 40th birthday. When greeted at reception, we were immediately advised that our room was exactly the same as other rooms except that it was on the ground floor - which we thought was very strange at the time - not so. Our room was accessed through the reception area and we felt like we were second class citizens staying in the laundry room/broom cupboard. The room was small and tired. The toilet had been pushed into a corner behind the door which was difficult to access. Couldnt even sit down properly. We were very disappointed in the standard of the room - we paid dear for this accommodation and it certainly was not worth it! We will be passing this information on to our travel agent. However, the location of the hotel was excellent. If we had been presented with a room which was not through the reception area I have no doubt the whole experience would have been more pleasant.", "Date": "September 28, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Cecilia Arc De Triomphe", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d230460-Reviews-Hotel_Cecilia_Arc_De_Triomphe-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$160 - $252*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">11, Avenue Mac-Mahon</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">17 Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75017</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514865", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/ed/90/0e/hotel-cecilia-arc-de.jpg"}}
