The reviews about noise confuse me. No one in my room had a problem with this. We watched planes go back and forth all day in awe of how cool it was, but never heard them. There is a little pub within walking distance if you are looking for easy lunch or dinner that they recommend. We ate there often but did not have a good experience there after midnight though.

I have stayed at other Hampton and Hilton Properties, I have stayed at Staybridge Suites and Holiday Inn, and also strip casino hotels. I prefer this location because of the friendly staff and the great service. Michael checked me in and he acknowledged my preferences and welcomed me back to the property. He answered my questions with a smile and provided great service by telling me about the breakfast. While bringing my items in, I noticed that a lady was pretty upset about something small in her room. I think she didn't get enough pillows (even though there are already 4 to a king and 3 to a queen). Michael handled her complaint in a professional manner and resolved the issue, as far as I could tell. Even though this lady was probably a little crazy, he was great and did what he needed to do to take care of the guest. Theresa was super friendly and remembered me from previous visits. She got me extra soaps and shampoos for my extended stay. She was working on a paperwork item when I asked and she stopped what she was doing to help me. I was pleased that my business was important. The breakfast staff was very friendly and checked with me to see if I was doing okay and if I had everything I needed. They did more then just setup the food and make sure the area was clean. They delivered personalized service by asking how the meal was and taking the dirty plates. Rebecca also remembered me from previous visits and talked to me in the Breakfast area. She was interested in what I had planned for my trip and was excited that I came back to visit. She offered some recommendations for a couple places to visit and check out.

The desk clerk was pleasant and check in was painless. I asked about printing my boarding pass for the next day. The clerk pointed me to the Business Center in a room behind the check in area. The Center contains two PCs and two printers. The \"wall\" to the outside is glass floor to ceiling. You need your room key to get in, so no one without a key can get in. The room was nice sized with a king sized bed. Sitting on top of the bed was a \"laptop desk\"... a piece of wood padded on the bottom with hand holds (like a dinner tray) so you can sit in bed and use your laptop easily. The TV remote was also on the tray. I found the bed to be quite comfortable. The room also had a desk with a desk chair, but it wasn't conveniently set up to work at the desk and watch TV at the same time. The bathroom had a very large shower (the size of a bathtub) with sliding glass doors to the floor instead of a tub. I liked this idea. I don't know if this is standard throughout the hotel. Note: This was not a \"handicap accessible\" room. I had read about the runway noise (takeoffs only) and so I put the a/c fan \"on\" overnight. Someone in another review mentioned the air conditioner as a noise contributor. Since you can set the fan to \"on\" and it's a constant drone, I consider the a/c fan as \"white noise\" and was hoping that it would drown out any airplane noise. I was planning to get up around 6:30 am, but was awoken just after 6 am when a plane took off. So, my idea didn't work. But, I sleep pretty light that early in the morning, so I don't know if you would be bothered or not. Breakfast was from 6 - 10 am. The breakfast area was different than what I was expecting. The serving area was standard, but the seating was different. There were a few standard tables, but then there were several tables that were more \"coffee table\" height than dining table height. In addition in the middle there was a long \"bar\" with bar type seating on each side (you were facing a person across from you). The breakfast was pretty standard. The \"hot\" items (that I saw) were scrambled eggs, sausage patties, and waffles (you make yourself). The scrambled eggs were ok, but the eggs were in the smallest pieces. I almost needed a spoon to eat them. I'm sure this has more to do with who made that batch of eggs than anything else. The apple juice was \"watered down\", but since it's a machine mixing concentrate and water, I think the replacement concentrate wasn't hooked up quite right. The orange juice tasted fine (same machine with concentrate and water). Checkout was quick and painless. Except for the noise of jets taking off starting at 6 am each morning, I'd recommend the hotel without exception.

The room itself was one large space with a sitting area and bed. The desk split the two areas and was comfortable to work at for hours. I had a car, so I don\u2019t know how much cab fare is to the strip. Depending on where you are going, it is at least 10 minutes or more to the strip, so I would guess cabs will run $10 or so. Cars are cheap in Vegas and parking is free everywhere, so I usually get a car. That gives you the flexibility to head out of town to Hoover Dam and hit some great local restaurants.

The rooms are pretty awesome! The little foyer area as you enter the room is tiled and connects you to the amazingly large bathroom with stand in shower and large granite top vanity. The closet located just outside of the bathroom is a little small, it can hang maybe about 6-8 items perfectly. The bedroom area was great and well decorated. IMO, I think the interior designer of this hotel must really like DWR, Z Gallerie and those type of furnishings. Each morning, they host a complimentary breakfast, which is really an upgraded continental. I wasn't a fan of it but, no complaints really since it's complimentary. They had your basic breads, bagels, muffins, danishes, cereals, fruit, make your waffle, eggs and one meat, coffee, juice, milk and tea. The bread products were cold and when the hostess would replenish them, they literally were just out of the freezer. The coffee wasn't the greatest but had caffeine which is all that mattered to me. One day they had a ham and scrambled egg mixture going on, which was tasty but the next day, it was dried scrambled eggs and paper thin bacon on the side. Again, it's complimentary, it's not designed to satisfy your morning appetite, much less your palate, but, it'll get you through the morning. We ended up only eating there the first 2-mornings out of the 5-mornings we were there. Okay so it's going from excellent to good to bad, it eventually had to happen. The hotel is literally next to the runway of LAS. You can see the runway, from our room at least. You don't hear the planes landing as much as you hear and feel the thunder of the planes taking off. The first night, I literally woke up to the rumble of a plane taking off at 12:40am, probably because our window was vibrating. No kidding! We asked the front desk agent the next morning, who BTW wasn't all that pleasant, but seemed like she had a scripted answer to the ever popular question. We were unpacked anyway and didn't want to move so we just went to CVS and bought ear plugs, which DID help. However, we were in an odd number room, facing the back. I have a feeling if you got an even number room, facing the front, the noise isn't as significant. Not sure why the front desk agent wasn't so proactive in trying to make us happy, the hotel wasn't full or anything the whole time we were there. Overall, it's a nicely furnished hotel. The service might be a little iffy. But it's just too close to the runway for me to comfortably stay there again. But, the concept and design of this newer hotel sure made me appreciate Hampton Inn's much more!", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, CA", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best Hampton Inn's I have been in!\u201d", "Author": "Ariktravel", "ReviewID": "UR89120511", "Content": "I have been a Diamond member for 9 years and rarely stay in a Hampton Inn but this one caught me by surprise.

Bathroom was clean with walk in shower and good water pressure. Toilet was low flow but powerful. Room was well designed with work desk and rolling ergo chair; there was a flat screen TV with cable (did not watch much TV during my stay). Free internet connection and free wireless, which is always good to have. Small pool and workout room, which I did not use. Breakfast ended at 10AM. The usual complimentary Hampton breakfast (which is better than most hotels) with scrambled eggs and sausage, cereal, yogurt, juices, pastry, bread, fruits, coffee. Took the Hampton free van to Mandalay Bay (their only drop off place on the strip); driver was nice and informative. Later, call Hampton for pick up at Mandalay Bay; took about 20-30 minutes after call to get picked up; different driver was also very nice; he dropped me off at the airport. Overall, an excellent stay at Hampton. I've stayed at various Hamptons across the country and have come to realize that Hampton is an excellent chain.

When we arrived and checked in I asked if there was a crib in our room the lady said no but she would get me one as soon as her driver of the shuttle come back which would be about 15-20 minutes I told her that would be fine we would give my grandson a bath then he would use the crib. 30 minutes went by and I had looked out the window and seen the shuttle was back I called down to the front desk she again said no the shuttle hadn't been back yet and she would get it soon. 20 minutes later I walked out to my car and seen that the shuttle was there when I was going back into the hotel the shuttle was leaving so I had thought the crib was in the room when I got back to the room still no crib.
