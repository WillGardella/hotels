WOW was I wrong, I can not say one bad thing about this hotel!!!! We were there for a week and breakfast was included. Breakfast was immense it was a buffet with the normal toast, cereals & fruit and then there was a hot items section with eggs made to order whatever way you wanted them and there was also a waffle station and a cake/muffin section. If I remember correctly if you were to buy the Buffet it was about $12 which we would not have paid as we are happy with a donut but as it was included we were over the moon!!! We ate there every morning and loved it. The room was spacious, clean and modern - everything you would want from a hotel room and free wifi! We had requested a room on a high floor as if you were on the side of the building overlooking Sea World you can see the fireworks (a tip I got from a previous review) and we watched the fireworks almost every night!!! We used the pool everyday and it was clean and well laid out!! Not too busy either. Staff were very friendly and helpful and we loved the cookies left out on the reception desk every night.

Our check-in took two seconds, extremely impersonal...never used our name, never acknowledged our needs that were clearly in our reservation. Our room was horrible. Upon entering, one bed was shorter than the other height-wise. Throughout our stay the shorter bed was losing stuffing from somewhere, never did find the source. The other bed was just broken. I went to search under the bed to find a shoe and there was broken wood and little nails coming down. We had to ask for our rollaway that was in the reservation. We had to request extra towels, other than the for provided for our family of 5...everyday! Nobody ever caught on to that basic need. Also in the reservation. Due to our tight schedule we did not have the time to sit around our room waiting for all of this. The pool was nice and well maintained and the breakfast staff, in particular Juan was very accommodating. He always remembered our family. Another special person was our bus driver to Seaworld this past Monday morning...extremely friendly. Other than that, any staff we encountered put their head down or just ignored my family's presence. If you want a place to stay anonymous and are not too particular about your room needing some TLC, this is the place for you. If you are not looking for \"service\" you'll be good here. The location is good and the shuttle service to the parks is fine. There is a CVS which is right across and convenient. The saying you never get a second chance to make a first impression is so true.

I picked this hotel based on the reviews and must admit that I was pretty disappointed. First the good - we arrived at noon (4-hours before the normal check-in time) and they gave us an early check in for the two rooms that we reserved. The front desk clerk (unfortunately I can't recall her name) was very helpful and friendly. She was more than willing to get us in early and was very, very pleasant. The other hotel staff that I encountered also seemed very friendly. The hotel common areas and rooms also seem very clean. The not so good - my biggest complaint was the A/C unit in our rooms. Despite setting the temperature to 72, it would cool to around 74 then the heat would literally kick in and crank the room up to 80 degrees. These temperature swings kept happening no matter what we tried. After setting the temperature even lower (69 - 70) and hoping for success, we left the room for a while and when we came back - it was a balmy 80 degrees again. Early that evening, we called the front desk and reported the issue prior to going out and grabbing some dinner. They said that they'd send the maintenance guy up right away and when we came back, the temperature seemed to be going back down (it was around 74). Unfortunately, it was going through yet another temperature swing so we called the front desk again. They said that the maintenance guy reported that he had checked it out and it was \"working fine.\" The room cranked up to 80 degrees yet again and the maintenance guy came back and apparently, did some additional investigation. He spent about 10-minutes looking at things (mind you - this was around 10 PM) and determined that the thermostat had a short in it (I'm not sure why this wasn't figured out on the first visit earlier). He then disconnected the thermostat and had us adjust the A/C unit directly. He then said that he'd come back in about 15-minutes to make sure things were working OK but never showed up. Since things seemed to be working OK at that point, we waited it out until 11 PM and decided that he wasn't coming back to check again and decided to go to bed since we had to be up early for our flight. The front desk never called back either to make sure things had been worked out. During the night, the room got stuffy again so I'm not sure the unit ever really worked properly. All in all, it was pretty annoying. I would have to say that the hotel is convenient to Sea World and about 15-minutes from Disney, depending on the traffic. I also paid a rate of $109/night so the price was good. However, as far as \"ambiance\" goes, I would say this hotel seems to greatly miss the mark. It's a basic, hotel that seems better suited for the business traveler or for folks wanting to go to Sea World. There also isn't much around to walk to (besides Sea Word and a few other places). Overall - we weren't impressed with our experience and I would recommend that you stay somewhere else. Even setting the A/C problems aside, I wouldn't choose to stay here again.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel, nothing extravagant!\u201d", "Author": "AsianMom03", "ReviewID": "UR127040062", "Content": "This hotel is your standard nothing special hotel.

He asked if there was anything that he could help with, before we arrived. I asked if he couldn\u2019t block our favorite room, and hinted that we might arrive at the hotel a little early. Within a few minutes I got a short and sweet email in reply. \u201cYour requested room has been blocked. We look forward to seeing you, Sir!\u201d The next morning my wife and I arrived a few minutes after 10:00 A.M. (We know that regular check-in time is normally 3:00 P.M). Anyway, it just so happened that the young man at the front desk was Brian; who welcomed us with a handshake and a smile. Your room is ready, Mr. Kaye, but we are changing the shower head; so it will be just a few minutes before I can give you the key cards. What I expected, was the normal\u2026.. come back after 3:00 PM, or maybe try 4:00 PM (just to be sure), but that wasn\u2019t the case then. In a few minutes we were on our way to our favorite room (5 to 6 hours ahead of check in time). While we were waiting (for the key cards); Patricia (Associate of the year); had finished up with another guest. She recognized me by face, and come over to the side of the check in counter. After a hand shake, she reached over and gave me a big hug, along and a friendly \u201cWelcome Back\u201d. I turned around to see Gary, (Food and Beverage Manager); giving my wife a big hug. I thought to myself, \u201cThis is more like a family reunion; then a hotel check in\u201d. Minutes later, we were in our favorite room. My wife started unpacking bags, while I took the baggage cart back to the front lobby of the hotel. On my way back up to our top floor room, the elevator doors opened on the second floor. A young man, pushed a vacuum cleaner into the elevator, than pushed a floor button. Then he pushed a higher floor number. He then turned to me and said\u2026.\u201dExcuse me Sir, but I pushed the wrong button\u201d. As we both watched the doors open and close, he said\u2026\u201dI sure want to apologize for slowing you down today.\u201d Then as he exited on the right floor, he said\u2026.\u201dHave a nice day, Sir\u201d. As I walked down the hall to be with my wife, I couldn\u2019t help thinking about that fine, courteous young man, who we had never seen or met before. This young man had no idea that my wife and I had stayed in this hotel (last year), for a total of 55 nights. Nor did he have any idea that this trip, we were planning to stay for 11 nights. Yes, this fine young man (who I still don\u2019t know by name); took time from his job as \u201cYoung Man in charge of Vacuuming the Halls\u201d; to (for a minute) become \u201cDirector of Public Relations\u201d for the entire Hilton Garden Inn chain.

I moved to this hotel after staying at the Hilton Downtown Disney for one evening...originally had been moved to a nearby Hampton Inn that didn't work out so well. They welcomed me here for 4 nights and I was extremely impressed. From the moment I checked in with Brian, things were terrific. The room was large, with extremely comfortable beds, flat screen tv, fridge, microwave, and GREAT desk. Very strong wifi, and great AC. I am a Hilton Honrs Gold member so they included the breakfast buffet for me each day which was awesome. Heated pool and jacuzzi were excellent, and the hotel has on-site laundry, a 24 hour convenience area off the front desk with snacks and sundries, and a 24 hour CVS and 7-Eleven across the street. It is also within true walking distance to the Sea World entrance, even though it has free shuttles running. Parking at the hotel was free and I had no problems getting a spot. Lobby is nice with a great bar, and they have the nightly tradition of cookies at the front desk which was great! They also use some Neutrogena soap products in the room which were great! Note: the one thing I had to work around was the lack of safe in the room (I carry multiple computers), but the front desk had HUGE safe deposit boxes available and I stored my computers there when away and it worked out really well. I will definitely be back here...the value and the service offering are among the best I have found here.

It's not a luxury resort, but it's perfectly suited for any length of stay. It was lacking in a couple of things, but it made up for it in every other way. The place was easy to find once we picked up our rental car from the airport. Rooms were clean and spacious. Odd numbered rooms face SeaWorld. Supposedly SeaWorld fireworks, but I never saw/heard any. Here's the good: 1.) Air conditioners worked awesome. Some people said they were too loud, but they're the same as every other in-room AC I've ever used. If the sound of it kicking on bothers you, just leave the fan on. That way it's less noticeable. 2.) Free WiFi. 3.) Breakfast was huge. Our corporate rate provided it for us, but even the cash price was fair. 4.) Access to I-Drive and Convention Centre. If you have a car, there is a multitude of restaurants within a 10 min drive. Downtown Disney, and the outlet mall is also <10 min drive. Universal is a bit further, but still easy to get to. Couple minor things... 1.) The fridges in the room worked well. A little too well. Stuff would routinely freeze in them. It wasn't just mine, all the other people in my group reported a similar problem. 2.) Gym is small. Granted most people at hotels in Orlando get plenty of exercise at the amusements, those on business don't. Would have been nice if it was slightly larger with more free weights or weight machines. 3.) No usable stairs. I had the intent of using the stairs at the hotel instead of the elevator, but unfortunately you have no access to them from the main floor unless you go through the ballrooms. So they suited their purpose as a fire escape, but that's it. 4.) Beds were firmish. Fitted sheet kept sliding off and the comforter was sort of lumpy. I still slept ok, and they did have an assortment of pillows. 5.) Bathrooms are small, and not very well laid out. Staff at the hotel was able to resolve every issue I had. The bar opens up at 5 pm. Drinks are pretty pricey, but the CVS Pharmacy across the street had everything you needed. And a 7-11 just opened up beside it. The both sell beer and everything else. SeaWorld is super close. Pedestrian entrance is less than a block away. No idea why anyone would take the bus there. There isn't much else within a reasonable walk. Everything was a 20 min walk minimum if you had no car. I would have no hesitation about going back, but the hotel is more set up for business travelers with a vehicle as opposed to families on vacation. I will most likely be back on business again. I gave the location 3 stars only because it's not within a short walking distance to much. The area is still slowly developing. If you want to take a jog or anything it takes about 30 mins to go all the way around SeaWorld.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worthington, ohio", "Title": "\u201cWould stay again and recommend to family and friends\u201d", "Author": "Shari1523", "ReviewID": "UR125678587", "Content": "My boyfriend surprised me with a trip to Disney for my birthday.

I stayed at the HGI from Labor Day weekend 2011 for 10 days to visit Orlando and the parks. The hotel offers ample free parking to the sides and rear and there was no issues of finding a space in September. The rooms offered a large flat screen TV, a fridge, microwave and a coffee making machine. The only thing that is missing and to some travellers which is quite important is an in-room safe. Apparently you can also leave your valueables in the hotel safe at reception but that is very inconvenient. There is complimentary in-room wifi and wired internet connection. The front desk was pleasant at check-in. My room had a constant running water problem with the toilet but maintenance sorted the problem out in no time. I had a buffet breakfast daily which consisted of your usual eggs, sausages, cereals etc. The restaurant staff soon got used to my face on a daily basis and all very pleasant with tea, coffee and juice. There is also a self serve area set up in the bar with tea, coffee and hot chocolate in the morning. On the ground floor there is a small gym and outside is the pool area. The hotel location is excellent with SeaWorld directly opposite. I left the car in the hotel car park and walked across to SeaWorld which took about 10mins through the SeaWorld car park and saving $14 in parking charges. The trolley/bus stop is immediately outside the hotel. Driving to Disney takes approximately 15mins travelling straight onto the I4. Orlando International Airport is 15mins from the hotel this time straight onto the 528. If you have a room facing SeaWorld, you can sometimes see the firework display too. There is an Expedia travel desk in the lobby, if you are planning to visit SeaWorld then go to the travel desk early in the morning on the day of your visit and ask for a quick queue voucher. This is complimentary to all quests staying at the hotel. Overall this is a lovely clean well priced hotel to stay in Orlando. If you have access to a car then the hotel is well located to all attractions.

Having a car available, a central location was not a prime concern, so the Garden Inn looked a perfect choice. Although not exactly in the hub of International Drive, the major interstates are close by giving access to all the Orlando and Kissimee theme parks as well as Kennedy and Busch Gardens in Tampa. First impressions are that the hotel is out of the way. From the I580, you have to drive about a mile down Westwood Boulevard which is mostly offices and hotels . You won't find any of the bars and restaurants close by that you would expect staying further up International Drive. The hotel is next to the Radisson, which is a lot easier to spot when driving, especially in the dark. Easiest access is off Academic Drive between the Radisson and Graden Inn. The exterior is tidy, well kept and the hotel has a large free car park, something that not every hotel in Orlando has. For those without transport, shuttles are available to and from the airport and all of the major theme parks. A regular trolley service operates to and from the more heavily populated parts of International Drive if you want to go out for the evening. Before arriving, I had done my homework and found that the better rooms are at the rear of the hotel, which overlook Seaworld. These are the odd numbered rooms. I had phoned reservations the day before and asked for, if possible, a room on that side on floors 7 or 8 (the tops floors). On arrival, I was allocated an even number room on floor 4, but on querying the allocation, the reception was happy to reallocate me to room 709, a king non smoking room. The rooms are well laid out, spacious and light, with good quality fixtures and fittings. The bed was extremely comfortable, and offers the ability to vary the softness/firmness of the matress to suit your own tastes. There is a control for either side of the bed so a couple doesn't have to compromise. Every room is provided with a refridgerator and microwave, very useful if, like me, you prefer drinking tea to coffee. Coffee making facilities are provided in the room, but not tea making, The ability to boil water in the microwave for tea more than makes up for it though. The bathroom fittings are of the same high standard as those in the bedroom. Water pressure was excellent, dispite being near the top of the building, and there was always plenty of hot water on demand. A small range of toiletries were topped up each day as requried. For rest and relaxation in the room, wi-fi is provided free of charge throughout the hotel. TV sports about 30 channels, including the majority of the favourite free to air entertainment and sports channels. Air conditioning is controlled via a thermostat on the wall, so you can set the temperature of the room in the morning and leave it for when your return at night. For dinings, the hotel offers a bar area which serves food and drink until 2300 at night. The menu is the same as the restaurant, which is open until 2200 at night for those heer prefer to dine more formally. Room service can be ordered until 2300 from the restaurant menu, a 20% surcharge replacing the normal fixed service charge. Breakfast is not normally included in the room rate, but is available every morning from 6.30 offering a range of hot and cold buffet food, omelettes cooked to order as well as savories for the sweet toothed ones. There is a set cost of $12.50. Other facilities provided by the hotel include a small gym/workout area, heating outdoor swimming pool and hot tub, a 24 hour store for small grocery items/personal items/soap etc and and two launderies (great if like me you travel light). The main selling pont of the hotel is it's proximity and links to Seaworld. The theme park entrance is between a 15 and 20 minute walk from the hotel. Just walk down Academic Drive at the side of the hotel, cross Sea Harbor Drive and walk diagonally across the car park to your left to get to the main gate. As well as selling entrance tickets, hotel residents are entitled to \"front of queue\" priority passes, essential if you want to ride the coasters. Useful to remember is that combination tickets are available for Seaworld, Aquatica and Busch Gardens, and all tickets are valid for unlimited access to the parks for 14 days from your first visit. I you do have a room overlooking Seaworld, don't miss the fireworks display just before closing each night. Also on the recommended list for first time visitors to Orlando is a trip out to Kennedy Space Centre on Merritt Island. About a 50 minute drive from Orlando, it provides a comprehensive look at the American Space Program, past, present and future. Their new tour, Kennedy Up Close is highly recommended, since for the first time it allows visitor inside the huge vehicle assembly buildings where the massive Apollo rockets, and laterly, the space shuttle were assembled. The shuttle orbiter Endeavour is being stored in there at present, and visitor can get within 10 yards of it for photographs.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location.

The room has a great LCD TV and the microwave and Refridgerator are useful. The bed is comfortable and the noise level is perfect. The internet is up to Hilton standards and the GM, front desk folks, bartender, and very pretty slender dark haired server is very nice as well as all the restaurant folks. The food was very nice and had a great selection to choose from. The only complaint I have is the phone has some static and one needed a little adjusting to make it work. Not a big deal. The pool is very nice and has a very nice feel to it with the bar steps away. Now if you want noisy lobbies, lots of activity with tourists, difficult parking, and lots of traffic to deal with than there are lot's of those hotels to choose from.

The Good: The hotel was easy to find and easy to get to and from. Check in and check out went very smoothly. The hotel had everything in order and checked us in and out very quickly. The front desk staff was very friendly and very helpful with any questions we asked. We ordered room service late one night and were told it would take 25 minutes. The food arrived in about fifteen minutes which was a nice surprise. The bed was very comfortable and I got a good nights sleep each night. The Bad: The room was not very impressive. One part of the wall had been obviously repainted and the color didn't even come close to matching the original color. The shower head in the shower was about chest high making washing of hair difficult. The shower floor was very high (I think for plumbing underneath) however this left little room to have a reasonably high shower head. The Ugly: The housekeeping service was obviously done by someone who didn't really care about their job. One day the trash was not emptied in the bathroom. Another day the trash was emptied in the room however the bag was not replaced leaving a trash can that was rusty and nasty inside. We had set 3 cans and bottles by the trash can and only two were taken away. The trash can at one point was left near the center of the room (obiously not returned to its location after being emptied). We did leave a $2-$3 tip each day and got this type of service (I understand $3 is not a lot of money however expected better service even without a tip). The bathroom shower was very dirty looking. I don't think it was actually dirty just old and worn down. The comforter on the bed looked like it had been used for 10 years. Instead of having an even thickness the filling was clumped up in many different places. The sheets came off one corner of the bed one day to reveal a very nasty looking stain on the side of the mattress. It looked like someone had been murdered against the side of the bed. Overall I would not recommend this hotel due to the fact that there are about a million hotels in the Orlando area. The price was reasonable however I think compared to others in the area better deals can easily be found. Maybe I just got a bad room but I wouldn't come back. I did not bring these issues to management so I am not sure how they would have responded. The issues came up over the course of several days and not all at once which was not enough to make me complain.

My husband and I enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. All the employees who worked the front desk during our stay were wonderful and extremely helpful. They answered all our questions and were friendly no matter the time of day. There is also an Expedia local expert stationed at a desk by the front entrance and all the experts that we encountered were very friendly and knowledgable as well. The hotel was very clean, well kept, and has eight floors. We were given a room on the eighth floor facing the front of the hotel. The room was large and roomy. There was a king bed with two night stands, an alarm clock, a sitting chair with small coffee table, a writing desk with a nice ergonomic chair, a large flat screen TV atop a dresser, a fridge and a microwave. The bathroom was roomy as well and was very clean. There is a nice sized closet with an iron and ironing board. The room was very quiet. There are no safes in the rooms. Instead, there are safes by the front desk. They give you a key in order to lock up your valuables. Yours is the only key that opens the lock. So I would say, don't worry about security as I used the safe and everything was fine and this is coming from someone who was very hesitant to leave my stuff by the front desk. We didn't use the pool or gym so I can't comment on those areas. We ate at the hotel restaurant one night and had the pizza special - $19.95 for a large pizza, 2 liter coke product and buffalo wings. A great deal. The service at the restaurant was excellent. The waitress was accommodating and friendly. The employees we encountered at this hotel really were just great. You couldn't ask for better staff. The only problem we ever had was with someone we never encountered - the housekeeping staff that cleaned our room. We came back to the room one night to find that our trash can had not been emptied of trash which was disconcerting seeing as how we had left a tip on the bed for housekeeping. We also didn't receive a newspaper during our stay except for our first and last day, meanwhile we saw other rooms received a paper daily. Other than housekeeping, we thought the hotel staff was great. Every morning by the front desk, they have complimentary coffee and tea for guests and at night by the front desk they put out free cookies for guests. The hotel provides complimentary shuttle service to Universal Studios, Disney World, and SeaWorld. There are specific times when you can catch these shuttles. The hotel's Disney shuttle drops you off at Epcot and from there you can hop onto an official Disney shuttle to get to the other Disney theme parks. You have to then return to Epcot to get picked up for the return to the hotel. It might sound difficult but it was fine and pretty convenient. The hotel shuttles to Universal and SeaWorld were great - convenient pick up and return times and large comfortable shuttles. The hotel shuttle to Disney though was a different story. The hotel's Disney shuttle is a shuttle run by a company called Crown City. It picks people up from other hotels before it arrives at the Hilton Garden Inn and is a much smaller shuttle. Once it arrives at the Hilton, it's already packed and is standing room only. If you're lucky enough to get a seat, you may find yourself wondering who built the shuttle. Apparently whoever built it didn't think people would need leg room because from the back of one seat to the seat behind it, there is about 1 inch of leg room and sadly that is not an exaggeration. From the Hilton it traveled to two other hotels before it finally arrived at Disney. The week we stayed at the hotel, the return times to the hotel were 6:40pm and 10:00pm. Who decided on these return times?! Magic Kingdom closed at 7:00pm and Epcot closed at 9:00pm while we were there. A 6:40pm pick up time cheats you out of time at both parks and the 10:00pm pick up time left you standing in a parking lot for an hour after the park closed waiting for a shuttle. The 10:00 shuttle was always packed and it was always standing room only. The driver always arrived past 10:00 and there was always a lone woman sitting in the front. Who was this mysterious woman and where did the driver pick her up from? Hmm could it be that she was the reason he was always late? She took up a seat that could have gone to a hotel guest. Apparently the week prior, there was a 9:20pm return time ... wish they would have kept that time for the week we were there. There is a CVS located across the street from the hotel which was very convenient. You can pick up water, snacks, and anything else you might have forgotten. We bought rain ponchos from there when we heard it was going to rain one day. The ponchos really saved us when it started to pour at Universal. The CVS is open 24 hours. If you're going to order in, we ordered from Flipper's Pizza and it was pretty good. Their prices are reasonable and delivery was fast. The toppings were very fresh and the pizza was good. Once they arrive at the hotel, the front desk gives you a call and you go down to the lobby to pick up the pizza. So, all in all a good hotel with great staff. If housekeeping and the Disney shuttle were better, then the hotel would've been excellent.

Quick-Queue (normally $29.99/person/day) is great if you want to go on the rides. Very few people had a pass so we got on the rides with almost no waiting time. (And over and over again) The pass also includes one complimentary ride on Paddle Boats and Skytower (another saving of ca. $10/person/day) As the Quick-Queue passes are for one day only we had to go to the Travel Desk in the lobby early next morning to get new passes. Sea World is very close. It takes only 5 minutes to get to their parking lot and then another 5 - 10 minutes to get to the front gate. It is great to be so close.

Staff is excellent and always accomodating. LOCATION: The property is considered a Sea World accomodation (see benefits paragraph below) - and is adjacent to the entrance to Sea World. It is easy-on-easy-off from I-4, and is close enough to supermarkets and every dining possibility. And, most importantly, it is away from the International Blvd madness (stay away from that bottleneck between the hours of 3pm and 10pm---esp in the evening). SEA WORLD SHUTTLE: Do *not* waste your time with this.....it took us 32min to ride from the hotel to the main gate of Sea World.....because it stops at Doubletree and Aquatica prior to Sea World......the bus is crammed-standing-room-only, and just is to much of a hassle. TRUST ME (and Zacharey from the Expedia Travel Desk in the lobby), the main gate is 11.5 minutes from the hotel (I timed it coming back to the hotel....only rode the shuttle to the park). Walk to the park.....it is easy and hassle free. BENEFITS: Staying on property gives you cetain benefits: Free Quick-Queue (normally $29.99/person) - this allows you head of the line and free admission to the tower and paddle boats. They also give you a 10% discount card. Add those two things, along with saving $15.00 for parking - - and staying here pays for itself with the benefits. In order to get the 10% card and the Quick Queue, you must check-in with the Expedia Travel Desk in the lobby, prior to leaving for the park. The Expedia Desk opens at 7am (I got there at 6:45am, and was the first in line). After 7:01am, the line becomes very long and time consuming.....so, be early. ROOM: We had a 1-BDRM SUITE (2 BEDS/SOFA BED) - - rooms are not huge, but were more than comfortable for my family of 5. The bathroom is a bit \"ehh\" small.....but, we managed. Microwave and fridge in room. POOL: Fun pool (no slide, not a \"resort\" pool), but large enough for the guests and open late (11pm). FOOD: There is a bar (not bad) and a full menu restaraunt. Breakfast was really good and included in our room rate (Military rate)......however, I believe that normally breakfast is not free. There is a small mini-mart in the lobby.

The wait-staff during breakfast is the same people every day and they are so nice! We had a King suite, there was a nice sized bathroom, which was very clean, a kitchen area that includes a microwave, mini fridge and coffee pot, the room has a flat screen TV and a desk. The bed is comfy but I found the pillows to be too poofy and too hard. The view we had was the SeaWorld parking lot/SeaWorld. The pool area is great, it provides you with a nice sized pool, great layout chairs, fresh towels, and music along with fountain jets in the pool that make a trickling water effect, the pool area is very relaxing.

It was in a great area, not crowded with tourists and hotels like you would be on International Drive. Had a rental car so I didn't rely on any public transportation but I often saw a trolley pass right in front of the hotel. It was a breeze getting to and from the airport. Only spending 1.75 on tolls. The room was clean and big, great comfy huge bed. We didn't get our non smoking King bed so we had to get a smoking room, which I worried about because my partner and I are both asthmatics. It was not as bad as I thought it would be. I was expecting a smelly stinky floor (we were on 2nd floor) BUT NOT AT ALL. we did buy some Febreeze at CVS just in case but the smoking room we were at didn't smell or drive us crazy. We were in and out of the hotel all the time, aside from the check in person when we got there and the bartender (BRIAN) we didn't get to interact with any of the hotel staff. The bartender was very nice and had made some great drinks. The TV was great, just wish it had some spanish channels. The Microwaves and Fridge worked great so we had it stocked up with drinks and left overs. The bathroom was huge and always kept clean.

Having stayed in hundreds (if not thousands) of hotels during our business years, and now in our leisure years; we know goodness when we see and experience it. A few years ago, we visited HGI Seaworld for a few days, then moved on to other Florida cities. Last year, we visited this property, stayed a month, but had prior commitments, so we moved on to Miami and Key West to enjoy other Hilton properties. This year, we decided to visit HGI Seaworld, over the year end holidays, with plans to move on to other Hilton properties though out Florida in January and February. Once the holidays were over, my wife and I realized that there were still interesting things to do at Millienium Mall, Florida Mall, and the two Premium Outlets; so we decided to extend our stay for a few more weeks. (The hotel is located between many nice shopping areas, and down the road from Disney attractions). After enjoying our shopping, we learned about Islewood, Bay Hill and the interesting lake properties around Orlando suburbs. So we spent many days looking at what real estate opportunities may be available in the area. Each morning we enjoyed our cooked breakfast, and after a few days, Gary (the restaurant manager) came to our table and let us know that it was nice to have us as his guests, and that his staff, Pilar, William, Guillerimo, Jose, Christina and others felt like we were part of the family. Each morning they greeted us with a smile and ushered us to a table that they kept especially for us. Then one morning it was obvious that with a full hotel, the breakfast staff was stressed because of a large convention, at the Convention Center on International Drive. That morning a tall handsome gentleman came over to our table and helped clean some of the plates, but took time to greet us and let us know that he had seen us, but we hadn't had a chance to chat. It happened that the gentleman was Mike, (the hotel's general manager) who was helping to serve the customers (one busy morning). His willingness to pitch in and serve the guests impressed us to no end. It was obviously his lead, that was what was behind \"The Good Spirit of Warm Friendly Service\" at the hotel. To make a long story short, we enjoyed getting to know Mike and his wonderful staff. Each time we passed the front desk, Patricia, Chris, Annie, Steven (and all the others managed to give us a smile, and say \"Good Morning\" or \"Good Afternoon\". In fact, after a hard day of shopping, it was nice to hear one of Mike's staff say...\"Welcome Home\" On our final night; as I looked out the 7th floor window and was enjoying \"The Seaworld fireworks\" for the 52nd time this stay; I felt my wife's hand on my shoulder. I looked over at her, and saw that she had a tear in her eye. I said honey, what's wrong? She said:\"I hate to leave home tomorrow\". We decided not to buy a home, or condo in Florida. We'll just plan to return next year to our home away from home. Thanks, Mike, Gary and your entire staff for helping to end our 2010 with joy, and to kick off our 2011 with \"Fantastic Memories\".", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kitchener, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDecent place to spend a couple of nights\u201d", "Author": "MamaJojo123", "ReviewID": "UR95009199", "Content": "Booked this hotel on Priceline and got a good deal.

While we were there It ran twice in the morning to each place (about 8 and 11) and picks up in the evening late afternoon and at 9.30 from Epcot allowing you to see the illuminations. Dont forget that you can hop around using disney transportation once you are at one park so the shuttle whilst its not frequent is more than adequate for your needs. We took the shuttle once ( so we could drink) and found it most useful.The hotel has a bar, restaurant, pool, laundry room- pretty much everything you need on site. We drove so got breakfast from places on international drive- if you dont drive I would say that you would need to eat in the hotel as there are no restaurants within walking distance. The itrolly bus picks up all along the street outside tho so you can always hop on that to get places. The best thing about this hotel is the fact that is is right on Seaworlds doorstep and a short walk to Discovery cove. We walked over to Seaworld in 10 mins saving on the parking :) I would reccomend this hotel and would stay again as the location is great. Just off the I4 its a short drive to all the theme parks ( disney about 15mins away) you have premium outlets 10 min drive away- great for picking up some bargains!", "Date": "May 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nebraska", "Title": "\u201cbest amenities, location, comfort, price A+++ orlando vacation!!\u201d", "Author": "jenniibux", "ReviewID": "UR62038903", "Content": "My husband and I recently visited Orlando for the first time in about 20 yrs for a bday trip, to visit Disney and Seaworld.

The supervisor, James, at HiltonGarden Inn was an awesome guy. Very polite and cool to talk to, served us delicious drinks at the bar. I chose this hotel because of the free shuttle to disney (VERY VERY cost efficient because its FREE) and its literally walking distance to Seaworld, or you can also take a free shuttle just down the block. They pick u up at a bench right in front of the hotel pool. So helpful! Our room was on the 4th floor, Room 434, nice view of pool and palm trees so i could look down and check to make sure hot tub wasnt busy (oh yeah did i mention that previously? awsome hot tub for those sore feet from walking at disney all day!) . Our bed was SO COMFY, very nice sheets, room was simple but very nice. Free WIRELESS internet! yay! we also enjoyed room service for an early dinner. This place was the best. and we got a great deal ( on expedia.com) .

We loved this place. (We had a view of Sea World, could walk to and from Sea World, comfortable beds, outstainding customer service, reasonably priced tastey food, a great little pool area with a very warm pool (which my son and I love and look for) plus a hot tub). We booked the Sea World package that for an extra $20 a night offered two Sea World tickets (nice deal). We ordered room service twice: Kid meals my son ordered (pasta one night) (peanut butter and jelly the other) came with yummy fries and apple juice (actually drink of choice and this is what he picked) and were both under $5. The one night that I ordered room service too, I got a delicous salad and a tasty BBQ chicken sandwich. The salad was about $4 and the sandwich which included fries about $7. My only disappointment with food was the cost of breakfast $12 for the buffet or $8 for a continental breakfast. If you aren't getting the Sea World package, you might want a package that includes breakfast with your room. Rather than pay this, we ate snacks that we brought along or purchased in the little store by the front desk and left overs in our refrigerator for breakfasts. Next time, I'll bring a soft sided cooler with some breakfast items. Rooms have mini frig and a microwave. I liked this place so much that one day after being back, I booked another mini three day trip for March. Things to note: Bed are doubles rather than queens // Our air conditioning didn't work initially. This was fixed as soon as we made a call, but keep this in mind and call right away if you book here and find yourself in a room that isn't cooling off right away when you turn down the thermostat. Side Note on other ratings of the property: I was very surprised to see that the Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World only gave this property a 65 for a quality rating. I've stayed at six other Orlando properties listed in this guide that were ratings between 93 and 75 which I thought that the guide had rated appropriately. The low rating for this place just didn't make any sense to me, and usually I think the unofficial guide is right on. // Tip regarding Sea World -- walking over is great.

We got a great deal with Travel Republic in the UK with full buffet breakfast included in the cost. We've previously stayed at the Peabody and Renaissance at Seaworld, and I have to say the customer service and care at the HGI was every bit as good - if not better as those two higher class hotels. The HGI is located just across the road from Seaworld's car park and is a brisk 15 minute walk to their front gate. Overall we had a great stay. The beds are very comfy, the rooms were cleaned to a high standard every day, breakfast staff and all front desk staff were very polite and helpful. The pool looks fine but we didn't use it, nor did we use the exercise room, but it always looked very quiet. Just off the reception is a \"pantry\" which stocks a range of sweets and drinks and pre-packed food for use in the in-room microwave. And because you use reception to pay for anything, it's open 24hrs a day. And adjacent to that is the \"business centre\". Two PC's for surfing and checking emails and one dedicated \"airline check in terminal\". All rooms and communal area's had Wi Fi as well, so constant surfing the whole time on my laptop. The biggest problem we had was with the room air conditioner. I can't understand why ALL reviews on here don't mention this. The air con machines for all the rooms in this hotel are actually located IN THE ROOM, sitting just under the window. As such, when the fan kicks in you get the full volume of the fan blowing then when the cooling compressor kicks in you get the rattle and humm from this too. Either one would be bad enough, but when the two are running at full pelt, the noise is unbearable. The first couple of days we resorted to cooling the room to freezing point in the day then pulling the plug out the wall when we went to bed. Got fed up of this tack eventually so complained to the front desk and they admitted the air con machines were noisey and were all due to be replaced. New ones had just arrived in fact.... so, ours was replaced for a nice shiny new one that day. First class service. But! The only difference was that the fan control had a \"half speed\" setting on it, so it was a wee bit quieter. At least we were able to cool the room and sleep, so the holiday wasn't ruined. The way the problem was dealt with was first class. We were treated with respect and never felt we were wasting anyone's time. Any time they said something would happen, it did. It's just a shame these air con's are actually IN the room - never seen that before in any hotel.

We hoped that the smell was due to the air conditioner being set on low and went about our business. The second day of our stay I happened to walk barefoot over near the air conditioner and the floor was soaked through approximately 3 feet around the area! Hence the mildewy smell. No problem for us because this room was the last of the non smoking rooms so we jacked up the air and lit a candle. We notified the management upon checkout.

(My mother smokes, so I'm used to being around smoke, but she doesn't smoke in bed and the Hilton's rooms have no windows so the smoke here is strong and stale.) I immediately went to the front desk switch rooms and I was told that they had absolutely no non-smoking rooms left. I explained to her that I specifically booked a non-smoking room, per the options available online when booking, and I showed her my confirmation page proving my non-smoking purchase. She basically said that booking a non-smoking room only means that you're requesting a non-smoking room and that they can't honor all requests. I then asked if they could transfer us to another Hilton, since there are so many in the area, and she claimed that there was nothing that she could do. I came back a second time and was told again that nothing could be done. Thankfully, I ran into a manager on the way back to my room and, after about 1 hour of pleading, a room \"suddenly opened up.\" One positive thing about the hotel: The Hilton's side street has a sidewalk & goes right into SeaWorld's parking lot. You can also take the SeaWorld shuttle directly to Aquatica from SeaWorld, but Aquatica completely closed their entrances around 11 am twice during our week due to \"maximum capacity.\" We attempted to take the hotel's shuttle once, but it was running almost 30 minutes late & we didn't make it to Aquatica before they sealed the entrance.

The room was wonderful, clean, and always comfy to come back to after a day at the parks.

Hilton also offered a free shuttle daily to and from Seaworld. However... the hotel IS within walking distance to Seaworld, but the walk is not user-friendly. There are no sidewalk areas. We had to cross over and walk in along the side of a busy road and through the Seaworld parking lot. We did use the shuttle to get there the next day, but the return shuttles were very limited, and only come back at 5 and 7 pm (although Seaworld closes at 10 pm in the summer months because of nighttime shows/fireworks). So we found ourselves walking back to the hotel, at night, in the dark, through service areas/back parking lots of another nearby hotel, through dark parking lots and roads. It was very unnerving. The hotel should consider adding a later shuttle during the summer months to accommodate people who are going to Seaworld and staying for the summer night shows. If there were lit accesses/sidewalks, it would be different. The room was very nice and the beds were comfortable. The pool area was great, and the in-hotel restaurant had a breakfast buffet daily (although it is $12 per person.) The staff were very nice and very helpful.

The front desk staff were very nice and the restaurant staff were nice as well, although sometimes there did not seem to be enough staff in the restaurant. The hotel was very crowded, as would be expected. My one complaint which is not entirely the hotel's fault was the noise levels in the rooms. We could hear the family (and baby) next to us, and we could hear families coming and going down the hallways. We were awakened one morning before 7:00 AM by a family yelling to each other down the hall and talking on their cell phones. Maybe they could sound-proof the rooms more.

I talked to the lady at frontdesk in the morning and she gave us the options of changing room or she would ask the technician if it\u2019s possible to put the desk into the room. We decided to stay and get the missing stuff. She called him, he said yes, he will fix our problems. He even promised to fix the brandnew hairdryer that was falling off the wall while it was used.

Our room even had no dust bin (only a tiny one in the bathroom). There was no free breakfast (would have cost 10 $ though all over in Orlando you get buffet for 3,99).
