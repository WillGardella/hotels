We fit comfortably in the small twin room with shower, but a tall or large person would have difficulty maneuvering in the bathroom. The room was clean and well lit, with two comfortable beds, a desk, two chairs, a small TV with only French channels, and a storage unit that had plenty of space. The safe and mini-fridge were in a locked unit, so we just took the key with us during the day. We saved a lot of money by picking up food at one of the nearby grocery stores and making our own breakfast. The keycard to the room goes in a slot by the door to turn on the lights. The problem is that the keycard also turns on a heater in the bathroom. Since we had warm weather, we had to leave the bathroom window open to counteract the heater. The bathroom was very clean and modern with an excellent adjustable showerhead and plenty of hot water. There was also a handy makeup mirror (and a full-length mirror in the room), but the bathroom was poorly lit. The hairdryer worked well. We could hear a rumble from the metro even in our sixth floor room, but it didn't disturb our sleep. The neighborhood is fairly quiet at night but busier during the day. It seemed to be safe even when we arrived back at 11pm one night. It's a quick walk to the Picpus or the Nation metro stations, but on Sunday morning the line we wanted wasn't running until 10am. We had a good, reasonably priced Italian dinner at Ristorante Amalfi on the same block as the hotel. The hotel personnel were helpful with information and printed our boarding passes for us. They also stored our luggage on the last day. We rode Bus 351 from and to the CDG airport for 3 metro tickets each. That bus runs between CDG and the Nation station and took us about an hour and 15 minutes in the middle of the day.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat service ...

Also, it was important for us that the area was safe, as we were two young girls and I can only say that we always felt safe and were never afraid to walk around in this zone by ourselves (not even during the night)! The room was rather big (especially the bathroom) and very clean! Prices are very cheap (especially for a city like Paris), but breakfast was not included. (Still, it was not too expensive to eat at the hotel and the breakfast buffet was great!)

Looks like a small hotel of Agatha Christie\u2019s book. The rooms and bathroom are very small but clean with comfortable beds and good douche (not easy to find in Paris). The breakfast is simple but very French and tasty. The cost/ benefit is EXCELLENT. I stay there every time I go to Paris. I strongly recommend the hotel. Only a recommendation to the owners: implement a taxi call service.", "Date": "October 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stevenage", "Title": "\u201cNothing Special\u201d", "Author": "TaniaMacDonald", "ReviewID": "UR13594105", "Content": "The \u2018Nation\u2019 Train Station (RER \u2018A\u2019 line, which is orange) is the nearest stop to the Lux Hotel. When heading out of the train station look for two tall columns. On the right hand side there is a road called Boulevard de Picpus. Walk down this road (approx 100 metres) and you will see the hotel on the Left hand side. The \u2018Picpus\u2019 Metro line 6, which is light green, is very close to the hotel. The hotel is very small and unfortunately not very modern. There wasn\u2019t even a kettle. It is definitely a 2* hotel, very basic. We stayed in room 315 which was very small for a 3 of us. The room needs a make over and the bathroom is soooo small you can hardly move. You will be banging your head on the sink when using the toilet. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. We only paid \u00a398 for two nights so I can not really complain. You get what you paid for. The hotel was great in terms of central access to places like Disney and/or Paris. We asked for extra pillows and towels and they brought them to our room straight away. . We had dinner in the Ristorante Amalf (located just outside the hotel). The Pizza was lovely, but avoid the Spaghetti Bolognaise. We literally had a tablespoon amount of mince on watery spaghetti.", "Date": "February 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eastern States", "Title": "\u201cA Very French, Cute Little Hotel\u201d", "Author": "DaffodilSparkle", "ReviewID": "UR12211462", "Content": "This was the first hotel we stayed in on our trip to France, and we were welcomed and pleased. It has nice curb appeal, a sweet little elevator, and a winding spiral staircase upward if you care to get the excersize. It was quaintly decorated while still carrying all the modern neccessities. Our room was clean and convienently held a microwave. There were windows as well, overlooking a pleasabt courtyard backed up to apartments- it was fun to see locals do their normal activities- we saw a lady hanging laundry and someone cooking dinner. Breakfast the next morning was delicious- they had hot chocolate, real croissants, eggs, biscuits, and (my favorite) little glas jam jars that we kept and brought back as souvineirs. We had a lovelty trip, beginning with Lux Hotel Picpus- it was also close to great sightseeing.", "Date": "January 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGood value!\u201d", "Author": "blondedawn", "ReviewID": "UR10001758", "Content": "Overall, we liked this hotel a lot. Front desk staff was very friendly. Room was clean, and comparatively spacious to other rooms we had had in Europe. Breakfast was tasty -- they serve actual croissants (among other things) from a boulangerie as opposed to prepackaged croissants like other hotels I have visited. And, of course, the price was right! It was very easy to reach the sights of Paris using the Nation or Picpus metro stops -- the subway lines serve the Louvre, Arc de Triomphe, and the Eiffel Tower directly. If you don't mind having to ride the subway for 10-15 minutes, this is a great value -- much cheaper than the accomodations more central in town. We also liked the area around the hotel. A *bunch* of boulangeries, where you can stop to get some bread or a pastry as an evening snack; a supermarket right at Nation; lots of brasseries.

This is a typical small (39 room) Paris hotel in the 11th arrondisement near Place de la Nation. Each time my room was small but extremely clean, tidy and comfortable - with a comfortable double bed, small desk and chair, closet, 13\" TV (5 channels, all French), and bathroom. The small room (48 euro)was fine for me, but couples may want to get a bigger (57 euro) room. You are required to take breakfast (7 euro), but it is a good spread with croissants, baguettes, cold cuts, fruit, yogurt, cereal, coffee and juice. The hotel is on a quiet, safe residential street just south of Place de la Nation. While the Picpus metro stop is right nearby, you are better off walking 5 minutes to the Nation metro / RER station - the 1 line is the nicest metro line in Paris and runs right down the Right Bank to Notre Dame, Louvre, Arc de Triomphe, etc. The staff is friendly, and there is 24 hr front desk staffing. You can not find a cheaper clean, safe hotel room in Paris - but be aware that this is not the Ritz.", "Date": "May 16, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Lux Hotel Picpus", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d554230-Reviews-Lux_Hotel_Picpus-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$77 - $111*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">74, boulevard de Picpus</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75012</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515171", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/46/96/15/lux-hotel-picpus.jpg"}}
