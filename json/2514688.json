The location was very convenient for the subway, nearby shops and restaurants and a few blocks away from 5th Avenue and the Empire State Building. The suite took the form of a spacious room, adjacent to the street, which had been sub-divided to include a bathroom with a highly dangerous shower head, difficult to control, and a reasonably equipped, small kitchen. Our main concern was the noise factor combined with a very hard bed under the window on the street side. Traffic noise was continuous till past midnight, then started up again in the early hours. In addition, there was noise from renovation work being carried out on the church, immediately next door. The suite was reasonably clean, with some \"interesting abstract art work\" on the walls, but the area was jaded and in serious need of attention to bring it up to a reasonable standard.

Reservations were made through their website, 5 months in advance. Location: Nondescript brownstone building in a tree-lined neighborhood, with a local NY feel to staying here. There are no signs for the lodge so just trust that you got the right address - \"318\" is on the right side of the doorway. The subway station is a few minutes walking distance with diners and grocery stores/pharmacies nearby. We arrived in the evening and check in was straightforward. No lifts so be prepared if you have heavy luggage. Luckily our room was on the 2/F. The stairs were creaky; not sure if this was additional noise in some rooms but it did not reach ours. Our first impression was that of a lovely room with adequate space (We had 1 luggage), and enough wardrobe space. No safe available, but we locked our valuables in our luggage with no problems. Shower took up to several minutes to turn warm, but otherwise ok. There are 2 shared toilets on the floor, they were always clean and we never had to wait to use them. Free wifi too. However we felt that the cons outweighed the pros. - The double bed sagged in the middle and we had to sleep near the edges of the bed. - The pipes in the room were noisy. - The room got unbearably hot at night. The heater, which was next to the window, turned off when we opened the window. Then it got too cold! So we woke up frequently at night, and never had a good night's sleep in Chelsea Lodge. Maybe, if at least the bed was comfortable we would consider returning, but with a chance of a sagging mattress (also reported by some TA travelers) we prefer to try elsewhere the next time we are in NYC.

My wife and I stayed for two nights in a \"suite\" in September, 2011. The suite had that rundown, sort of first apartment thrown together look to it.

So the essentials were okay, except that the internet connection in the room didn't work. The problem was that, apart from a younger guy named Mike, who checked us in, no one acted like he really gave a flip. For example, our room wasn't made up during our stay. Not really a big deal, but certainly below the standards of the hospitality industry. When I returned the key during checkout, the crusty older man who took it checked to see if I had paid. When he saw I had, he said, \"Okay\". That's it. Would a \"thank you\" have hurt him? Again, it's not that big of a deal. My delicate sensibility withstood the slight. And, after all, I was \"only\" paying $229 per night, so benign neglect was all I could expect. I get it. Okay.

After doing a ton of research, we decided to go with Chelsea Lodge mainly based on the price and favorable reviews. The Chelsea Lodge was established in 1999 and I doubt much has changed since those renos. Each floor has about 7 rooms and 2 washrooms (toilet and sink). The main floor has fewer rooms and just a toilet with hand sanitizer on the wall. Each room also has it's own sink and shower. I had read that the rooms were small and yes, they are. The beds are a double/ full size and ours was against one wall. There was also a dresser in our room. We could both have our suitcases open in our room, and leave a path for walking around the bed to the sink but that was it. The small space really was not an issue because we were out most of the time (not hanging around our hotel room) and face it: most of Manhattan is super crowded. There was a wireless router on our floor but because our room was in the back, where the hallway curved, we could not pick up a signal in our room and had to stand on the landing, the hallway or go down to the lobby to use wireless the most comfortably. I assume the rooms closer to the router, not around a bendy hallway were ok with the internet. One thing no reviewer had mentioned is that the daily cleaners use very scented products in every facet of cleaning. I work in a hospital and am used to a no scent policy. The cleaners used pine sol and scented baking soda for the carpet before vacuuming. I saw one often use a can of glade and give a room a strong burst of scent just before she finished cleaning and closed the door. I would have to say, if you are scent sensitive or have allergies or asthma, you probably do not want to stay here. One other thing is that the washrooms are not soundproof. In the hallway, I could definitely hear people doing their business. Be aware of this. In all, I am very much in agreement that Chelsea Lodge is a great value!

My final comment for this hotel is positive, very convenient and strategic position for best areas visiting in NYC, though I think it is generally overrated. First of all the price: I am somewhat surprised to see so many favourable comments about economic competitiveness of this lodge: You are having extra-small room (ours was also very dark with a single window facing a wall) with private micro-basin and shower, shared bathroom at floor, and you're paying tax included 160$ per night... Not so cheap. Ok, it's NYC and you are closed to the Meatpacking District, in Chelsea... but i'm used to smart booking sites that offer much better rates for an higher star level, even in NYC. Secondly the service: everybody is entusiastic... Well, we recieved a cold welcome, very quick and not extremely polite! We've been given instructions and tips, but in many other places I think I got a much warmer and accomodating impression at the front desk. Besides be prepaired to experience all the drawbacks of a small lodge: e.g. after the first night we woke up at 11 am, being very tired from the previous day. Housekeeping is managed by a single person and most likely after 11 am she's off duty, so we did not have the room done. Btw the hotel is very clean.... Finally my opinion is that the coziness and the wonderful location of the Lodge do not balance the extremely small space of the rooms, the bath sharing, and the mid-range service offered.

It left a bad taste in the mouth and for this reason I think the hotel was very overrated. Great part of town though and the rest of the staff was friendly. I think the staff member I referred too, did not like to hear differing views from his own and may have regretted his aggression.

This is a corner room that looks out onto the side of another building; however the neighbouring building is far enough away that I still received a nice amount of natural light. The room layout is quite smart and provided more than enough space for me, my 25\u201d suitcase and tons of shopping bags. Housekeeping was on point during the whole stay. A thorough cleaning job, fresh/good quality towels and floors were mopped everyday. I was so happy to find lodging with a private shower & sink at this price point. The shared toilets (2 per floor) were incredibly clean \u2013 I felt like I was the first one to use it that day. Didn\u2019t think it was possible but I never had to wait to use the facilities at any point during my stay. Sound insulation between rooms was good. Air conditioning was a godsend and never gave me trouble. Note: for those sensitive to a/c sounds, the one in this room was a little on the loud side. It was fine for me and I\u2019m a medium sleeper. I am fairly out of shape and survived the 2 flights of stairs quite well. You can always request a room on the main (1st) floor near reception if you think it may be a problem for you. Note: I overheard a guest requesting a room change from the main floor to an upper floor for more privacy \u2013 so consider that as well. Access to transit is less than 5 min walk away (up 3 short blocks from 20th St to 23rd St and 8 Ave). You can catch the C & E trains from this subway stop. I came back to the hotel no earlier than 12:30am every night and never experienced a problem or felt uncomfortable walking from the station to the hotel. NYers stay up late and there is always tons of foot traffic. For breakfast, I ate at The Dish which is a very reasonably priced restaurant (try their French toast!!). If you prefer to eat near the hotel at night, there are loads of restaurants open until the wee hours on 8th Ave. Otherwise, just grab your Metrocard and run wild in the city.

I went to NY for professional reasons and extended my trip to visit the city : this was the hotel I chose, based on price and customer feedback and I must say my experience was very close to expected. The hotel is clean. I had asked for a quiet room when booking and enjoyed indeed a room on the garden and at the end of the corridor. I suspect you can very clearly hear people when talking in the corridor however i was so tired by my plane trip + jet lag that I just crashed at 8 PM and slept like a baby. The bed was comfy also. The personnel is not very friendly on the upfront - however I did find that whenever I had a request to make they were very helpful and charming. So don't hesitate to break the ice ! The room is very small. A double bed, a shower and a sink, and you can't really move around. It was perfect for me travelling alone and staying just one night, honestly I didn't need more. I would however consider this if I were travelling as a couple and staying a while (not really many places to put your stuff, and you can't really move around the room). However for me was perfect, once again. ... Ok the sink was a bit shabby, ok the shower was a bit rusty on the outside, but honestly the bed and general state of the room was super clean and much better than I could have anticipated for the price. Really good price for value. Also very convenient the subway and shop around the corner. So all in all, reco for those of you who travel on personal expenses.

This may not be the case if your room faces the front. The hotel gave me a key to my room and to the front door of the brownstone so I could come and go as I pleased. It felt like coming home at the end of the night. The room had a double bed which was very comfortable for one. I dont know if you book a double if the bed is any bigger. It would have been tight to share that bed with my husband. The room had an open closet for hanging clothes, a dresser, a TV which I never watched, a small desk, a double bed, a small chair, a sink and a shower. The shower had good water pressure and lots of hot water. The room did not get wet when I used the shower as has happened in some hotels I have stayed in.

The location of the hotel is ideal. Quick walk to the Village and Midtown. Great access to subways and you can always hop in a cab. The neighborhood has lots of great restaurants and bars and there were lots of people out and about late at night. The hotel is on a treelined side street though so it is quieter.

I've stayed in both of the suites, plus in one room. If you can swing it, definitely get a suite (next door to Chelsea Lodge are the Chelsea Lodge Suites). Very spacious, absolutely lovely garden in back. Perfect for a longer stay (but I stay in a suite no matter how long I'm staying in NY). If you stay in the hotel, ask for a room downstairs with a bath. Rooms are small but clean and totally adequate for a NYC visit.

We arrived late in the evening and fell into bed exhausted. Unfortunately, I didn't get much sleep that night between the street noise, the early morning garbage trucks, and the automated heating system which came on and turned the room into a sweltering hell. I was miserable, and not looking forward to the rest of my stay. Fortunately, when I requested a quieter room, there was one available for us. We ended up in a tinier room in the back, which my daughter didn't like, but which I appriciated due to my light sleeping habits. There was next to no natural light in the room, which for some people might make getting ready for going out tricky, but we checked our makeup in the hallway under the skylight so it was no big deal. The shared bathrooms were always very clean, which we appreciated. Sometimes other patrons using the facilities in the middle of the night jarred me out of my sleep, but of course if you're not a light sleeper it probably wouldn't matter to you. The housekeeping service provided clean towels daily. The room didn't bother me as much as it did my daughter, I never expected it to be large or light. I came to New York to spend time outside of my room, and I liked coming \"home\" to our little room and taking a hot shower and getting into the comfy bed and sleeping in a QUIET room. The staff were extremely helpful, taking time to look through subway maps or on the internet when we needed information about anything. A button popped off my jacket before I was heading out the door and the deskperson located thread and a needle so I could do a quick repair. They ordered a car service for us to take us to the airport and were always available to answer any concerns. Dragging heavy bags up and down two flights of stairs wasn't too easy for me, but the person who greeted us the first night assisted me with my bags.

The accomodation was clean, traditional and felt very homely. Our room on the 2nd floor didnt seem small as other reviews have stated, we took 2 bags rather than suitcases and had enough drawer space to unpack and put the bags under the bed out of the way. The bed was really comfortable which was a welcome relief after a long day sightseeing. The shower and the sink in the room worked well and we never had a problem with the shared toilets, there was 2 on our floor and they were spotlessly clean and always free. We only saw one or two other guests during our stay so going to the toilet in the middle of the night didnt cause any problems either. We didnt hear the pipes banging as some people stated maybe we were lucky and the hotel room was warm and cosy which was needed as it was bitterly cold out and about during the day. The room had everything you need with a small Tv with enough of a selection of cable channels as you relaxed in the evening, complimentary toiletries and clean towels provided everyday. The rooms dont provide safety deposit boxes but I cant imagine there would ever be an issue as all the staff were so friendly and had all worked there years, we kept our valuables locked in our bags and this worked well for us. James on reception was helpful and patient in answering all our queries and gave some useful advise where to shop etc. We stayed here with my parents who are in the 60's and they enjoyed it equally as much as we did. The hotel has an excellent location only just over a 5 min walk to 2 different metro stations we also walked most of our time and it took just over 35 mins to walk to Times Square. We found walking the best way to experience New York and so easy to follow the roads as they are all at parallels, just get a good map before you go and you wont get lost. Be warned however on arrival at the airport as there was 4 of us we decided to get a taxi, dont go with any driver who approaches you inside the terminal as they arent insured generally, the offical taxis are outside and it cost us 70$ including tolls to get to the the Chelsea Lodge. If there are 2 of you travelling you can get the Newark Air Transit from Newark for 15$ per person single journey then a taxi from Penn station to Chelsea Lodge was 5$ although the taxi journey on arrival took about 30 mins (not much traffic when we arrived) and the train took closer to 1hr 30mins and harder work with luggage when we left. Getting around New York is so easy, we walked everywhere during the day as mentioned and would take a metro back in the evenings. You can get a 7 day unlimited metro card for 25$pp, a single trip is 2$ which has to be used within 2 hours of purchase or a 4 ride ticket for 7$ which has to be used within 24 hours. We felt perfectly safe wherever we were and only took a metro home at night as we had done som much walking during the day. Taxis if there are more than 2 of you travelling would work out just as cost effective as they were also inexpensive however it took us a while to flag one down during rush hour and the metro would get you to your destination quicker. Make sure you get the right train from the right station as not all trains go from all stations, the lines available are shown at the top of the steps to each metro station, once you go in and purchase your ticket you have to swipe it to go through the turnstiles, your ticket is then used for that trip so if youve bought a singe trip ticket and you find you are on the wrong stations its invalidated. Also make sure you know if you need uptown or downtown so you dont end up on the wrong train - seems obvious I know but it can be disorientating on arrival. Sightseeing: we went to Top of the Rock, fantastic we did this during the day, its not as cold and the Empire State Building as they have plastic sheeting all round - doesnt spoil the view, its on 3 levels and gives you 360 panoramic views its was about 19$ pp entrance and we didnt queue for long. We visited the Empire State Building at dusk, its a such a beautiful building and as it went dark the night skyline is amazing, it was very very cold so we didnt spend long but I would recommend a visit again entrance is about 19$pp. We visited the New York fire museum in Soho 278 Spring Street its only small but has some fascinating artefacts and a seperate room dedicated to the 343 firefighters who lost their lives in 9/11, entrance was only 5$pp. We took the free Staten Island ferry to see the statue of liberty, you get close enough to get some really good pictures as well as some great pictures looking back at the Manhatten skyline. Central park is an oasis of calm amongst all the madness, we spent 3 hours just walking round enjoying its serenity, visit Strawberry fields and the John Lennon imagine memorial placed by Yoko Ono, this is just infront of the Dakota Apartments where he lived and was shot outside. The zoo is only small but a nice place to spend half an hour, its only 8$pp. The World Trade Centre visitors tribute was particularly moving again its only a couple of small rooms but crammed with artefacts from the twin towers and photos of all those who died as a result of the terrorist attacks entrance was 10$ donation, you could have a guided tour with a survivor or a relative for 25$pp which lasts about 1 hour and is meant to give a more personal insight into events. Shopping - fantastic allow at least one day just to shop, when going to Macy's and Bloomingdales go to the visitors centre on the balcony level with you passport for 11% discount cards. Macy's souveniers in the basement, had great price jeans and wasnt as expensive as you'd expect. M+M world Times Square, you wouldnt believe what merchandise you could get over 3 floors, Disney store was really magical as was Build a Bear, even if these arent your usual places to visit they seem special because they are in New York. We found Footlocker good for trainers/timberland boots etc one large store in Times Sq and one opposite Macy's. Virgin megastore in Times Sq also had some real bargains. Cheaper clothes shop was Old Navy although some of the styles were abit unusual great for tops/jumpers etc. One piece of advise try and get a list of as many restaurants before you travel, when you are tired from a long day shopping the last thing you want to do it walk around looking for somewhere to eat. Eat in Chelsea we found it was at least half the price as anywhere close to Times Sq. We had breakfast at Toasties on 7th ave between 22/23rd which was really cheap (doesnt look great from outside but food it amazing) and empire diner 10th ave 22nd, other recommendation Galaxy diner 8th ave 19th. In the evening we ate at Dish a couple of times literally 2 mins just on 8th ave from the hotel prices are really resonable choice is good and food excellent and also at a Lasagna ristorante mainly lasagnas food was really good but abit more expensive. Also found great rib house/bbq close to either 18th/23rd metro sorry didnt write down address but excellent food good prices but gets very busy so was abit noisey. Starbucks are really cheap for a warm drink to refuel during the day but dont have much seating - avoid the toilets as they arent particularly clean. There are very few public toilets so its a case of finding them is shops - Bloomindales are 5* or small coffee shops etc. The Chelsea Lodge is ideal as an excellent value for money homely base to see New York, I wouldnt hesiste to recommend it and we are planning to go back in a couple of years and would definatly stay there again. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me, we had the most amazing time New York is fantastic just make sure you allow enough time to do everything, we had 6 days and it was just right.", "Date": "November 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent", "Title": "\u201cWow, what a haven from the hustle and bustle!\u201d", "Author": "TwinknChumb", "ReviewID": "UR22005645", "Content": "We stayed for 5 nights from 13th November.

We arrived by yellow medallion taxi from JFK airport (cost around $55 including tolls & tip). The taxi stand is just across the road outside the airport exit and even though there was a queue it is patrolled by a warden so it moves very efficiently. You will be hassled on leaving the airport to take a private cab/limo to Manhattan, however, we were warned about this as the driver's are not always insured. A firm \"no thanks\" was all that was needed to let them know you are not interested. It helps to have a note of the lodge address on a piece of paper just to hand to the taxi driver so that you end up at the right place! The taxi journey took around 40 minutes...be prepared for some mad driving though! The lodge reception was lovely and welcoming and the man on reception was warm and friendly he helped us with our cases to our room. We were in one of the basement rooms with en-suite toilet/shower facilities. The room itself was clean and functional and better than I expected for the price we paid. There was a TV with cable and also plenty of hanging space in the wardrobe. The shower had loads of hot water. The bed was an average size but to be honest I would have slept anywhere after all the travelling/walking! There was a noisy pipe in the room which woke us up every morning around 6.20am, however, that didn't bother us as we wanted to be up and out early. The room was also really warm. There is a ceiling fan but we did have to open the window to let the air circulate. Our room was cleaned and our towels changed on a daily basis. Overall I loved the unique feel of the decor and it felt more homely than a souless hotel chain. Chelsea was a great base for our stay. Good handy places to eat were The Dish and also Lasagne Restaurante. We also liked The Stage Door Restaurant for breakfast which was on the corner of 8 Ave & 33rd Street. The lodge is around a 20-25 minute walk to Time Square. We walked nearly everywhere so good comfy walking shoes are essential! Also it is getting very cold so take warm layered clothing so you can peel off a layer or too if the sun is shining. Fifth Avenue is a must for shopping, however, I did not like Abercrombie & Fitch which was more like a nightclub than a clothing store (maybe I am just getting old!) It is not comparable to any other A&F store that I have visited. The fact it was dark and mobbed didn't help I suppose. A taxi back to the lodge from 5th Ave cost $12-15 depending on the traffic. We also went to the \"top of the rock\" (Rockefeller Centre) which was fantastic as it was a bright sunny day. It cost $30 pp and was well worth doing as you can see both the Chrysler Building and also the Empire State and even the Statue of Liberty. The views are amazing. The Chelsea Lodge reception will order you a taxi for your departure trip to the airport and we did this as we were leaving at 4.30am and the cab turned up timeously.

We stayed in a deluxe room (#1) in the basement which had its own private bathroom and plenty of room space to spare. It was well worth the extra money spent for this upgrade from their other rooms. It was cleaned out very well (only smelled of cleaning solution upon arrival and it wasn't too strong). The bed definitely wasn't the most comfortable that I've ever slept in, and it was a little caved in the middle, but it wasn't horrible. After all the long and busy days we could have fallen asleep on the floor! The tv had cable and all the movie channels that you could ask for which was great when we had some down time to relax. The front desk staff were nice enough, We got a good morning every day and they were nice enough to call for a ride for us back to the airport. We took a taxi from Laguardia to the lodge which costed about $43 with tip and toll included (we only had to wait about 5 min for a taxi; there is a long line of cars waiting at the airport to take you & the city makes sure you don't get ripped off by giving you a slip with rates stated on it). The city can not guarantee you will get ripped off if you flag a taxi outside the lodge to get back to the airport, so that is why its recommended to get a flat rate car or shuttle service. Just ask the desk staff the day before you leave to arrange for a car to pick you up from the lodge (this service costed $46 w/ tip and toll). As for New York I learned a few pointers I can share with you. First, if you plan on taking the 1 line (subway) to South Ferry for the Statue of Liberty, make sure you are in one of the first 5 cars in the train otherwise you won't be able to get off on the last stop that you need to get off of. Also, be careful when getting on express subway trains. They skip a lot of the stops (black dot stops) on the subway maps! Second, skip the top of the Empire State building & go to the top of the Rockefeller Center. It costs about the same and you can actually get the Empire state and Central Park in your pictures. Third, if you are looking for the quality \"Coach,Versace, or Luis Vuitton\" purses (the C's look like a C and not Q or G) go to Canal street into the fake purse shops. Even if you only see the obvious fake purses just ask if they have Coach (or wait for them to ask you if you want a Coach purse) and then they will show you their secret stash or take you into a hidden upstairs room. Be aware: I wouldn't do this alone! We were taken into a locked van at one point which I wasn't happy about and no one should be alone, it felt unnerving. If they start walking you away from the stores then you are most likely going to a car so say \"no\" if you don't want to do that. As for shows, we saw Phantom of the Opera, Young Frankenstein, and Hairspray. The last two were excellent and funny, and Phantom was good too, but just not my kind of play. If you don't decide to see a show until that day, watch out for raffles done a few hours before the show. Both Young Frank, and Hairspray raffled off $25 tickets 2 or 3 hours (respectively) before the performance. The raffle for YF is actually for front row seats which is excellent. We didn't win that raffle but they allowed us to purchase wonderful balcony tickets for the same price. Don't forget your cash though, no cards accepted for this deal! If you don't want to take a chance waiting that long to purchase tickets just go to www.nytix.com and for a one time $4 membership fee they will give you promo codes on all plays for 40-70% off ticket prices which you can buy from Ticketmaster before you even go on your trip. Forget wasting your time and cash at a TKTS booth! Last tip: don't forget your cash!!! You will be surprised at how many small restaurants, rental places (boats @ Central Park), and tickets booths will only take cash. Have a great trip and don't hesitate to stay at this lodge.

It was very depressing...too small (no place for luggage), old run down furnitures, very bad smell, noisy from an old heater. The room was not also very clean either (dust everywhere and hairs in the shower) ... especially if I compare it to the bathrooms which despite were in common, were spotless! Had no problems with them always available when needed despite the lodge was fully booked. The shower in the room was the worst ...tiny, water did not run well and it was impossible to have it simply warm...it was either cold or hot. Additionally after taking the shower the room had water vapor everywhere! We did not expect a 4 star hotel but we expected some decent rooms! I was so uncomfortable with the shower that the last day I did not take it and waited to get to my next destination hoping it would be better. I can't say don't stay there but just don't expect anything and don't believe to all the positive reviews....there are more cons than pros in my opinion!

Also, you can easily walk up towards Madison sqaure/Empire etc no bother.... plus you get to see some sights on the way. The Lodge itself is in the village of Chelsea, which as we found is a residential area. But this is one of its great points. You walk out into the neighbourhood and its all locals, its great, not a tourist in sight (well apart from you). Eating in Chelsea is superb too. We had originally intended to goto chinatown, little italy etc for our evening meals, but having sampled a few of the eateries in Chelsea we thought why bother sitting on the subway when theres great places on your doorstep. We can heartily recommend the Dish for breakfast and the Italian/pasta place on the corner (name escapes me) for evening meals and drinks. Both ppovide great food and service and are cheap too. No rip-off tourist prices here. Although we did indulge ourselves for a meal at the Rainbow Room Grill one night which is on the 65th floor of the Rockerfellar Centre overlooking the Empire State Building. Google it for yourselves, brilliant place! (but expensive!) The hotel itself was spotless clean, no complaints. We were downstairs in the basement in one of the deluxe rooms which had its own private bathroom/toilet and shower. All of which were great, with towels changed everyday. It was quite a hot week when we were there, so the ceiling fan was on 24x7, but it was silent and did a great job and could be kept on through the night. There's cabled TV in room also. All 3 staff that we had dealings with in the lodge were helpful. I can see why some people might find the older chap a little dour and unhelpful, but thats just his persona, he was very helpful with us allowing us to use the internet terminal to prebook our seats etc for the journey home and let us print out our boarding cards and leave our cases in the recpeption room on the day we checked out.

The kitchenette was very useful - we couldn't eat out 3 times a day with american size portions so we had breakfast (captain crunch ofcourse!!) before heading out in the morning! The bed was big and comfy and the room was large (something that is not often found in New York apparently!). We had fresh towels daily and the room was cleaned late morning every day. As for location it is perfect! Chelsea felt really safe and had a number of restaurants, which were miles better quality than those near Times square and other tourist areas (also eat out in Grenwich village!) It is a couple of blocks from the subway stations which can then take you everywhere and then when you come back to your suite on the quiet tree lined street its just perfect! As we were going for 10 nights we didn't want to be in the centre of it all as we thought it would get a bit much - and there are sooooo many tourists!! but here we got away from it all at the same time as being only a subway ride away from anywhere in New York! I recommend the chelsea lodge suites to all and would stay there again! It is a fantastic place with my only complaint being that the heating was a little noisy at night which would occasionally wake you, but it was lovely and warm even though flippin' freezing outside!! MY TIPS: 1)When arriving from the airport GET A YELLOW CAB!! It is the law in NY for the journey from the airport to manhattan to be $45, its about $60 with tolls and tip. The queue looked massive but we zoomed through it. We saw loads of people getting ripped off as they left the airport being approached by private drivers saying the queue would take an hour and a yellow cab would cost them $100 dollars - we can do it cheaper! don't listen, its not true!!! get a yellow cab!! 2)If you need a supermarket come out of the chelsae lodge, turn right, go to the end of the block take a left, go down two blocks and on the corner is the cheapest supermarket we found near the chelse lodge (if you want semi-skimmed milk its 2% fat milk) 3)Use the unlimited subway pass you will save a fortune!! 4)There are no safes in the room but we had padlocks on our suitcases and used them to lock up our valuables instead Enjoy the chelsea lodge suites and the rest of New York you will have an amazing time!!", "Date": "January 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "SW Virginia", "Title": "\u201cA delightful litte hotel in a great location!\u201d", "Author": "H20-Gal", "ReviewID": "UR12987470", "Content": "If you come t o NYC and want a place to stay that won't break the bank, you can't beat the Chelsea Lodge.

After previously coming from an excellent B&B in Boston where we had received superb service it was even more apparent. He was not very welcoming or helpful when we asked him questions about the area. When we returned back at the end of the day he would simply stare at us with no acknowledgement. We both found him incredibly rude and would not use the Chelsea Lodge in future for this very reason.

Fairly peaceful as there are only four suites within the apartment. We had a garden suite so we had access to a shared garden although it was far too cold to spend any time in it. Would be great during spring / summer. Bed was really comfy after a long day of sightseeing and the room was warm although we had to bring out the extra heater when there was a cold snap (minus 10!!).

Loads of cupboards to hang and put away things. Location was perfect as there are three subways spread across 23rd Street which connected you to the main sights.

I'll give a few pro's and con's to help you make up your own mind but as other reviewers have said - you should be expecting a budget guest house with all its charms and quirks and not a bland but perfect 5* hotel, so dont be dissapointed by shared bathrooms and lack of roomservice, doormen etc. pro's - The price - it cost us approx \u00a375 per room per night - great value! - The location, great area of chelsea - lots of places to eat and drink nearby, on a very quiet sidestreet but just off a main avenue so the best of both worlds, we always felt very safe even at night. Also, being at the bottom end of chelsea you could stroll into the west village in 10-15 mins. - The lodge itself was very charming, it had none of the blandness that comes with a hotel chain, the decor, though you may not choose it for your own home was quirky, cozy and homely and always felt like a warm place to come back to at the end of each day. It felt much more like you had your own studio in new york and felt like we lived there for 5 days rather then the usual obvious tourist feeling you get staying in a hotel. - the convenience - we checked in after 10pm on our night of arrival and they held our bags for us on our final day until the evening, neither were a problem and the staff were always approachable. A few have commented on the manner of the guy at the front desk though i always found him to be perfectly nice and happy to help - he just didnt have that sickeningly nice permanant grin that some may expect. cons - the hotel is in a townhouse with steps up to the front door and there are 3 floors with no lifts so be aware if you would have access problems. - its frequently mentioned how small the rooms are and they are probably the same size as a standard double bedroom - they were plenty big enough for us and we didnt have a problem with the size at all but some may prefer more floor and wadrobe hanging space. - the in-room showers, although convenient do leave the room a little overly steamy and muggy but its not a huge issue - just open the windows and voila, its sorted. - even though it was freezing outside the room got stiflingly hot sometimes and there was no way to turn it down, though again this was solved very easily by just opening the window (though you may not want to do this on the lower floor facing the street) - we had a room that was quiet as a mouse - on the top floor, facing the yard and nowhere near the toilet. though i imagine that the rooms on the ground floor just feet infront of the reception desk and lobby must be extremely noisy, as would the rooms next to the toilets as the walls are very thin as mentioned before. i think it would be a case of pot luck as to whether you got a loud or quiet room but ours was perfect!

We wanted a clean place in a nice location, a good shower and a nights sleep....It's NYC after all, so many better things to do than stay in your room.... I was a bit apprehensive about the whole \"shared toilets\" issue, being a neat freak that I am, however the toilets were very clean. I tell you, cleaner than what I've seen at some people's houses. Even though really small, the rooms were very clean. We are both over 6ft and sometimes it was hilarious how tiny the room was for us (and the bed was a bit short too)\u2026But what this place doesn\u2019t have in size, it has in its charm and fantastic location. Some have complained about the noise, we had no problems. Yes, there is a school across the street and kids can be somewhat noisy in the morning; however that did not trouble us. Same with traffic... I mean it's New York, if you wanted a tranquil place to rest up, go to Maldives. Yes the guy at the front desk during the day could have been a bit nicer, but he answered our questions and helped with our suitcases\u2026.. Overall, Chelsea Lodge is a great little place and I will wholeheartedly recommend it to all my friends. It just depends what you are after. If you want a large room, king size bed and room service, this is not the place for you. But remember you will also pay a lot more that what you\u2019re paying here. If you want a cute little place, small but clean room in a fantastic location as your base for exploring Manhattan, go for it\u2026..Oh and did I say it was not that expensive either...", "Date": "October 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brandon, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice & Fantastic location\u201d", "Author": "Kashwashwa", "ReviewID": "UR10283660", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the chelsea lodge for 5 nights.

A couple of issues: 1. the bed - this was the biggest issue for me although not a vacation killer. the bed is a double (not a queen), which is fine, but it sags... fairly badly. So in other words, you and your significant other roll into the middle (which is fantastic, unless your trying to sleep ;) ). Solution: put a pillow in the middle - it gives support and prevents you from rolling into the middle. 2. noise - I'm not extremely sensitive to noise, but a couple of nights there were young groups of people walking down the sidewalk who weren't extremely noisy, but I could hear them fairly easily because there is very little sound-proofing from the window airconditioner being in the window. Solution: crank up the fan on the air-conditioner for white noise or wear ear plugs. There is a grocery store, a lot of restaurants, a few ATMs, and two subway stations right near by - fantastic location.

I slept very good and the atmosphere in the hotel was great. Nice people in the reception and very nice cleaning ladies. The location was very good. 3 blocks to the subway-lines A, C, and E.

I completely recommend it for the budget conscious traveler. Having stayed 11 days there recently, I do want to point out some things not mentioned (or rarely) about Chelsea Lodge in past reviews so you are an informed guest there. Keep in mind I give it an excellent rating for the category it is in. So do not take my negative points as a bad review, but as facts you need to be aware of. Pros. -Clean -Very quaintly decorated. -Cable TV on 13 inch LCD -Fast Wireless connection for your laptop -There is a police precinct on 20th St only one Block away -Neighborhood is safe and quiet -Our room was quiet \u2013 we could hear the birds outside our window in the mornings. (also see cons) -Staff was friendly and helpful the couple times we spoke -Cheap -Near many restaurants that are good and affordable -3 short blocks from the C and E line -2 long blocks from the 2 line. -Murray\u2019s Bagels is on 2 short blocks away \u2013 Best bagel I have ever eaten. -5% discount if you pay cash -Air conditioned -You get Hershey Kisses on the pillows when you arrive Cons -Basic accommodations \u2013 no fridge in the room and no ice available. If you want a cold drink you need to buy one from the corner or do like we did and buy a folding cooler and buy ice (which was a pain). -No toilet in your room but it was not available maybe 4 times in 11 days and we had the option to use the next floors or just wait 5 minutes. NEVER was there a line in a 11 days. -Our room was on the main floor which is a pro for hauling your luggage and your butt after along day out. But the Con is that there is a little lobby there with two chairs and on occasion people used the space to visit or hang out. Only feet from our room door it could be come a bit aggravating especially late at night when people came home and decided to talk and laugh there. This was not a big deal but something to be aware of. It only really was an issue one night. -The room\u2019s windows are screwed shut. You have to use the air conditioner or the fan mode in it to circulate the room air (there is a ceiling fan too). I have no complaints as to the air conditioner itself as it kept our room cool on plus 31C 0r about 89F days, however it did have other issues. The Air conditioner (in our room any way) was right over the right side of the bed. On these hot days you had to run it all night and even on the cool ones you needed to have the fan on. So you had an air-conditioned draft on you all night. As well the room gets very humid with showers etc. There was no way to open a window in let out the humidity. So we had the air conditioner cranked most of the time. -Cell phone reception in the building is terrible. In our room calls had to be made leaning up against the window or go outside. -They give you two keys, one for the front door of the building and one for the room. They are indistinguishable so you have a fifty/fifty chance of getting the right one each time you use them. It would be nice if they marked one with a dot of paint or something. -They make your bed daily but do not change the bedding. It is overall a great place to stay and we will return. I write all the pros and cons as nothing bugs me more than people who review a place like this comparing it to the Waldorf.

The location is wonderful: Chelsea is safe, fascinating, and convenient to the subway and all of the museums, neighborhoods, and stores that you want to visit. Staff were very helpful and accommodating; we were able to leave our luggage in the office upon early arrival and for several hours after checkout until our train left Penn Station, which is an easy, 15-min. walk. Given the great restaurants in Chelsea and subway/bus access to everything else, we did not use a single taxi. Chelsea Lodge is a great value, and we plan to return, but there are some caveats. First, the buildings are across the street from a school, which means that there is a great deal of noise from the students on school mornings. If you stay in a room or suite facing 20th street, be forewarned about this and other street noise; the windows are single-glazed, and the traffic and passerby noise will be sufficient to wake all but the most sound sleepers. Second, while the kitchen and bathroom in our suite were very clean \u2013 and the bed linens and towels were also very clean (with excellent maid service daily), our suite had the filthiest upholstered office swivel chair that we have ever seen - so filthy that we would not use it at all. And, while a swivel chair (which was the only upholstered chair in the apartment) makes good sense if guests need to open the futon or use the folding cot provided, there really is no excuse for such a dirty piece of furniture. The other furnishings were minimal and in relatively worn condition, but serviceable. Do not expect rugs or curtains; our suite had no floor coverings and metal blinds in the windows. Some additional lighting would be helpful; our suite had four very small lamps \u2013 new, but just one (next to the bed) had a 3-way bulb. With no bright lamp next to the futon/couch, reading there can be difficult. The kitchen had a gas stove, full-size refrigerator, dishes and utensils for 4, and a coffeemaker, but there was no toaster (?) or microwave. There was a very nice TV/VCR with digital cable. We have stayed in all kinds of accommodations in Manhattan and, overall, we had a great stay. But we will request a room or suite that does not face 20th street for subsequent visits. And we hope that the management will try to provide upgraded, cleaner furniture \u2013 we saw some beautiful and very low-priced items at the wonderful thrift shops in the neighborhood, so replacing some of the existing furnishings should not cost a great deal.", "Date": "March 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "NC", "Title": "\u201cCozy and inexpensive in Manhattan\u201d", "Author": "ceeroro", "ReviewID": "UR6935739", "Content": "My significant other and I have stayed at the Chelsea Lodge twice, and both times we have greatly enjoyed our stay.

In addition, even though the room was pretty small (and I agree with another poster--NOT good for long stays unless you have light baggage), we had a comfy bed, the shower and sink in the room worked fine and the room definitely had a cuteness to it. In fact, the picture of the room on the website looked exactly like ours. And sharing the toilets really was no big deal at all. They were both right across from our room and were always clean, fresh and I never had to wait once. In fact, I never saw anybody in the halls at all!

We stayed at Chelsea Lodge for 5 nights in early October and it was fine. The building is in a quiet side street in the Chelsea area, but is only 2 minutes from the nearest subway station on 8th Avenue. It's about a 15 minute walk to Madison Sq Gardens and a 30 minute walk to Times Sq or the the Empire State building. The nieghbourhood is very safe, very gay and has a lot of good places for eating and drinking (there's a cafe round the corner called The Dish, does great brunch deals for $10) On the plus side, Chelsea Lodge is well maintained and the rooms are nicely decorated. They have wooden floors and also have shower/sink in the room. The shared toilets are spotless and are not a problem, as there are 2 toilets between every 4 rooms. On the negative side, the rooms are very small, with many having the bed against the wall and only a few feet of space around it to move around. The biggest problem though is the soundproofing at this hotel - there isn't any! Because there are so many rooms and toilets packed onto each floor, every conversation, movement and sound can be heard from neighbouring rooms (or worse, the toilet!). The service is okay - though we had much better and friendlier service at other hotels in the USA where we stayed. Overall, Chelsea Lodge is a sound budget choice if you're going for an action-packed weekend in NYC and will hardly be in the room, but if you go expecting to have a quiet time and a romantic room with a view you'll probably be disappointed! Another tip is to try and get one of the rooms on the first floor closest to the stairs, as they don't have a toilet next to them and are slightly bigger than the others.

I had thought there would be a double or twin bed in the room because website specified 'a full sized bed' - but there was a single bed. It was fine, just disappointing when I had been expecting a double. Only other problem was that it seemed like this single room had originally been joined with another single room next door - as the shower cubicle for next door was built into an alcove in my room. It only happened once but my next door neighbour decided to have a shower at 6.20am - and the noise was pretty unbearable with pipes creaking etc for a few minutes. If it had happened anymore, I would have complained but I felt there was also thoughtlessness on the part of the person next door. Shower in room was fine and TV was welcome too along with an alarm clock, which came in handy when I couldn't use the alarm on my phone for a while. I liked the decor in the room and hardwood floors. Only thing I would say is that I didn't get a great first impression on arrival because the room stank of cleaning fluid. Someone had gone overboard and the smell stayed in the room for a few hours because window was closed on a warm day. It wasn't a major thing and at least it proved the rooms were cleaned thoroughly.

They didnt even jack the price up for New Year's like everywhere else does. The fact that there is a shower and sink in the room is a rare plus too.

I would thoroughly recommend this as a base to stay in New York.", "Date": "April 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, CO", "Title": "\u201cYup!
