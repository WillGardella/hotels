Got a rate of \u00a392.13 for a 3 night stay. Officially this hotel is rated as a 2 star, but in the UK it would easily be a 3 star property. Room allocated was quite close to the 'hotel circle' freeway - but it didnt bother us at night as the windows were well insulated. Carpet wasnt the cleanest, but bathroom was, and a fridge was included without charge. Free wifi, free parking, and use of an excellent outdoor pool and hot tub are bonuses here providing more 'bang for your buck' as they say in the US. The hotel is in an excellent location - the university area is less than a mile away which has some brilliant eating options ( dont forget to try 'Five Guys Burgers and Fries\"!), and is also only around 1.5 miles away from a huge mall ( Fashion Valley mall) and the superb old town. Its also located a short drive away from all San Diego attractions like the Zoo and the Quayside - a car, like when visiting most places in the US, is a must for your trip. You could easily spend a week in San Diego doing different things throughout and not getting bored.

I asked for one of the updated rooms and asked for a \"suite\". It seemed like a normal room to me, it just had a frig and microwave as extras. What I noticed right away was that the bedspread was wrinkled but in fairness, this is probably due to the very thin fabric. I'm not sure if the room had been upgraded since everything seemed very old. The windows in the bathroom and back window would not shut all the way. I went there to relax and it was anything but relaxing. They had trashcans rolling constantly up and down the upstairs corridor, until 4:00 PM. They put a girl in the room next to me who was screaming at the top of her lungs for several hours on the phone and constantly going out the door to smoke and slammed the door every time. I had a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on my door and some tall guy comes to my door and pounds on it. About a half an hour later, I saw him being hauled away by police. I went to the office to complain about the noise and the stranger at the door and they just said \"well the guy won't be a problem anymore\" (since he was being hauled off in a police car). They didn't seem to know what to do and eventually offered another room. I went to look at it and this non-smoking room smelled like someone had just smoked 5 packs of cigarettes. I went back and told them I couldn't stay in that room and they didn't offer any other solution. They never talked to the girl next door. Also, there is no elevator at this place and no help with bags. Now, I know that I couldn't expect the Taj Mahal but I was expecting more than this. I would go with the Wyndham Gardens near Sports Arena if you are a Worldmark owner or Wyndham rewards person. First and last time here.

Having stayed here for a similar period in 2010 we were again not disappointed with our choice of San Diego or the hotel. We inadvertently booked a room without a fridge; however, the General Manager provided us with a fridge complimentary saving us $100+ which was a nice touch. The room was of a good size and standard, as before, with a powerful shower to match. The in-room safe managed to lock with our valuables in and refused to open; however, a call to reception brought the maintenance man who opened the safe and replaced the batteries within 10 minutes of calling! Ate at Adams Steak n Eggs (onsite) most mornings for breakfast and the food and service was superb as before. Ate at Albies Beef Inn (onsite) once \u2013 the food was ok but either the menu has changed or the range of choices was not as good as we remembered it! Pool was good, clean and warm; especially for mid-January. The only complaint this time was the location of the room. Last time we stayed in the block at the back of the property which runs parallel to the freeway and this seemed to have minimal road noise; however, this time we were located in one of the side blocks near the very front of the property which was very noisy at times from both the traffic and other inconsiderate guests!

I was uncomfortable, itchy, sore and hot. Sure the hotel staff apologized, were nice, and moved us, comped me and my friend $150 each for the 'inconvenience' but I feel that's just not enough. I'm seeking legal action. Just make sure you check the room first. But, I wouldn't recommend a place that doesn't change the bedsheets every single day (I found stains one morning, probably from where I was bit, and they were still there when I got back that night!)

The desk staff was accommodating and very helpful. Once we checked into our room our opinion of the Travelodge changed. The room was an eyesore. The colors on the walls did not even match and did not look like anything that was advertised on the website. Mold was starting to grow on the bathroom walls and ceilings because there was no ventilation fan. A window in the bathroom had to be opened that barely opened and closed. Each time we opened it we were afraid that we wold not be able to get it locked again. The room smelled like a strange cleaner.....like something was being covered up. The staff was accomodating when we asked to change rooms, but the room that was offered reeked like cigarettes. Although the paint decoration was better we could not stay in a room that had so clearly been smoked in regularly. The property was covered with cigarette butts, garbage, beer and soda cans that had obviously been there for a long time. They need to hire property maitenance staff that cleans the grounds daily. cigaregtte butts were stuck inside the stairs and littered around the pool and spa. The Cabana area that looks so nice on the website was dirty and covered with garbage most of the time we were there. GROSS! We requested a room on the top floor in the back of the property and felt safe and secure during our stay. I will attach pictures to show how dirty the property was. Also, I desperately needed to use the guest laundry facilities but they closed at 8:00 to be locked for the evening. I decided to start the load the following mornin at 9:00 am and was informed that it it not unlocked unitl 11:00 am. Who does laundry during those hours on vacation? We were checking out that day and could not wait! Also......it costs $3.50 per load to wash and dry. Very spendy if you can make it during the open hours. We will not be staying in this location again and will probably never stay in another Travelodge if this represents their standard.

The only negative is the bathroom could use some updates and a continental breakfast would be nice but no big complaints there.", "Date": "February 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "southern california", "Title": "\u201cWorst hotel experience\u201d", "Author": "lovetotravel722", "ReviewID": "UR17961921", "Content": "Perhaps one the worst hotel experiences ever.

A Travelodge is just a Travelodge after all, so don't expect to get five-star hotel treatment. Another reviewer comments on the room safe charge: I was asked to sign a clause on the registration form saying that there would be a daily charge at the end of my stay if I used the safe.

I should note that I am not the pickiest of people when it comes to motel/hotel rooms. As long as it is clean and safe, I'm basically happy. I stayed at this motel in a king bed room for 5 nights. The room seemed clean enough and I thought the bed was comfortable. Our room wasn't right next to the freeway, so the noise didn't bother me (I should mention that I am super sensitive to noise, so the fact that I didn't hear anything at all is impressive). The decor was basic motel decor--nothing I would decorate my house with, but not overly depressing or dated. The window in the bathroom was a little strange, but it never became a problem. I found the front desk staff to be very friendly and accomodating. We were able to buy Sea World tickets at the front desk, which saved us a long wait in line. This motel is also centrally located. We walked to the Fashion Valley mall for food and to catch the train to Old Town (which is definitely worth a look--very cute and great food choices!). It was about a mile, we just cut through the Town and Country Resort (where our conference was held). The only real negative to this motel was the pool. It wasn't heated and the hot tub was only luke warm. Pool seemed clean enough though. The best part of this motel is the breakfast restaurant, Adam's Steak and Eggs! Incredibly cheap--I never paid over $8 and on average only spent about $6. Fresh cream for coffee, everything tasted homemade, and the corn pancakes were the best I've ever had. I'm actually very picky about food (unlike motel rooms) and really, this was great food. The Pam-Pam restaurant up the street (connected to some other hotel, but I can't remember which) is also pretty decent for late night, standard \"American\" cuisine. All in all, the rooms are fine. They were cheap and suited our needs perfectly. Remember, this is a Travelodge, not a Hilton.

I guess they give you what you pay for so in that respect alone, it's not \"terrible\". The place is in an excellent geographical location, again warranting better than \"terrible\", but pretty worn-out and didn't have a clean feel at all. The furniture is beat-up and dirty looking. The floor lamp had a stained shade. (How does this happen? Did a prior guest have a food or drink fight?) The lamp had obviously fallen over several times and the pole was bent and crooked. The front desk wasn't exactly inviting. The clerk at check-in obviously would have rather been anywhere but waiting on us. When we checked out in the morning, they had signs hand-written in blue marker all over the front windows warning people that there was no vacancy: \"No Vacancy, Means No Vacancy\", \"We have NO Singles, Doubles, or Even a Broom Closet!!\" The signs were rather terse and inconsiderately worded. I found them rather offensive. Based upon the signs alone, I would not return even with a reservation and I certainly wouldn't stay at another Travelodge if that is how they feel about their future guests; that they are a big bother. Maybe they should have invited the inquirers in to see if they could put them up at another Travelodge in the area. Instead, they were just chased away. The room appeared clean but upon closer inspection, it became obvious that it wasn't. We found used tissues between the bed headboard and the wall and found a piece of jewerly on the floor next to the bed. This leads one to believe that they don't vacume the carpet. If they had vacumed, they would have found the jewelery or at the very least sucked it up with the vacume cleaner. Therefore, I refused to walk anywhere without shoes. I began to wonder what else they didn't clean. Did they clean the bathtub, toilet or even wash the sheets? What kind of bacteria is growing in the swimming pool? The air conditioner vents were all broken and/or missing and the unit was so noisy and vibrated the window above it so badly that we couldn't even use it the first night. Since we were so hot the first night, I finally had to take the window screen out the second night and adjust the metal casement window in order to keep the rattling to a bearable level. In addition, the rental car bus storage facility directly behind our room spewed diesel fumes into the room when they warmed up the buses in the morning. The general noise level at the motel is also very disturbing. Constant loud talking, slamming of doors, and banging on the walls next door. We had a stranger knocking on our door in the middle of the night along with a phone call from another guest who couldn't figure out what room her friend was in. All-in-all, I wouldn't recommend this motel unless you don't care about cleanliness, noxious fumes or noise.
