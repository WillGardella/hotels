I can only assume that this hotel must not be targeting the business traveller - unlike Smyth, Tribeca Grand, Trump which I had previously stayed at.

Yes it's my personal opinion so let's break it down. The hotel is boring. Tedious. Boring. BUT maybe you like boring? Maybe boring suits you? Boring means no colour or brightness to assail your vision just different shades of mushroom. Boring means being able to get a cab within 60 seconds on leaving the building because nobody else is around at this grungy, shabby end of the delicious Thompson Street. Boring means being able to completely avoid the first floor lobby and its staff by taking the ground floor elevator straight up to your room. Boring means having no public areas to hang out in during the day except a very vacuous lobby area. Boring also means QUIET. If low key is your style book now. The whole place need a refurb. except perhaps the bar open evenings until 2pm. Ten years down the line I am SOO over dark brown corridors dimly lit. My bedroom was as dull and shabby as one could wish. TIRED furnishings, tables and cabinets. It had all that you need but I know you can do so much better for the price. I spent a lot of time in my room and was so tired of it after 6 nights I asked for a complimentary upgrade for my last weekend (duration of stay 9 days). The ineffectual manager showed me a room but refused the upgrade without my paying. Mean spirited. There is no service elevator. \"What's the problem\" I hear you ask. Well yes I agree but in fact it pissed me off grandly particularly in the mornings having to share the Elevator with racks of dry cleaning, bags of laundry, mops and buckets, a man with a hard floor polisher, room service debris and a chimney sweep. (No only kidding about the last one). Why build a new hotel (10 years old) without thinking of this? Oh well, I guess I'm just fussy. The restaurant downstairs is well known. Kittichai. It is an example of trend over successful cooking. Very dark and a nice place to meet an internet date, (I had one such couple sitting next to me). I was served a thai coconut soup in such a ridiculous paper 'bowl' I couldn't eat it for practical reasons. Once decanted into the bowl it should have been in to start with it tasted like a gloopy can of coconut milk with none of the freshness generally expected. One day the concierge just didn't bother to show up and I was fobbed off with excuses by the dreary lobby staff. I never used the concierge services after that. To end on a positive note the guys on the street door are delightful and will get you a cab in the flick of a lamb's tale. This sadly could not dissipate the dreadful sinking feeling I had on returning to this hotel each day. I felt as if I were entering a coffin.

I had just gotten off a 30 hour or so flight from Australia and so was feeling pretty tired. New York was fabulous but this hotel was an absolute shocker. The hotel was unbearably hot. I was in the top floor and suspect that made it much worse. When I turned on the cooling in my room hot air came out and made my room hotter. It was impossible to sleep unless you open the window. Unfortunately it was then impossible to sleep because of the street noise. Hence I had 3 sleepless nights following a 30 hour flight from Australia!! Upon telling the hotel staff the answer I repeatedly got was that due to the recent snow they were required to turn on the heating within the hotel and as the temperature got hotter instead of staying cold the rooms were hotter. But this is not good enough I am afraid. For the price of the rooms especially. On top of that rooftop bar was closed (as \"too cold\") and the bar at the reception level was under renovation. Restaurant for breakfast was beautiful but took over 1 hour for what I hoped was going to be a quick breakfast so that I could get out of the hotel.

It was my second time dining there and I recommend the Red Curry Sea Bass w/ side of vegetables. Checking into the hotel the staff was extremely friendly & informative. It was a Sunday so the hotel was a bit quiet. Plenty of seating in the window lined lobby that boast a brown and cream interior, very earthy. There is a restaurant off the lobby. After riding the elevator up to room 44, I was admiring the wood surrounding the hallways and the corridors leading to the few rooms that occupy each floor. This was one of the smaller rooms I stayed in but, the d\u00e9cor & comfortable luxury made up for that. No view but a spacious beautiful bathroom you want to spend more time in. The shower was very cool. Around 5pm the rooftop bar opens, a great place to come after you dined a Kittichai for a cocktail over looking the Empire State Building. The vast view with very little building makes you feel like you stepped outside the city; very pleasant. The d\u00e9cor is carried all the way upstairs and is elegant, sophisticated with a woodsy feel. I loved this space.

The hotel offers a car service for $115 that includes all tolls & tips if you can afford that.

I suggest calling them first because they always beat the hotels prices by at least $10-25. Plus they don\u2019t charge a fee since the hotels give them referral fees. You have to call them because they don\u2019t post prices on their website, it\u2019s how they can keep the prices down. You will call them first on all your vacations, I do.

I had also read mixed reviews, including those talking about the place being a bit shabby. Overall, I was impressed with the hotel. I found the location was great (right within easy access of all that Soho has to offer) but in a quiet spot. I found the decor stylish, without being overly done. The staff almost without exception were friendly, genuine and chatty. The hotel is not cheap, but not many are in New York. I had asked for a room higher up as heard that the lower rooms can suffer from noise from the trendy bar on the lobby floor. And it was quiet and peaceful. The room was a decent size, with decent sized bed (though not as comfy as some of the chain hotels), sofa, big TV. But no desk to be able to sit and work at. This was a miss as sure these days even people not on work also like to sit on a laptop and so on. The wireless access is expensive at $14.75, and it costs per device and so if you attaching a work laptop and maybe a personal iPad you pay twice. The bathroom was great, and had shower and no bath. Something more common these days. Room service was very fast and very friendly. The restaurant downstairs, which is a Thai fusion, was not that good in my view. It is very popular and although I was so-so on the food, they did amazing cocktails (especially the Classic Moijto) There is a very small fitness room in the basement that was average.

I spent a lot of time in advance of the trip trying to decide where to stay. Knew I wanted to stay in SoHo to be near my sister who lives there. My sister typically refers people to the SoHo Grand, but LOVES the rooftop bar at the 60 Thompson. A client who is in the hotel industry, spends a lot of time in NY, and is otherwise \"in the know\" recommended either The Mercer or 60 Thompson. At the time I initially checked availability, The Mercer was full and - even it they were not - the rooms were significantly more expensive than 60 Thompson. However, a couple days before I left for the trip, rooms became available at The Mercer and the prices between the two hotels got a bit closer. I stuck with 60 Thompson b/c I didn't want to spend the extra $100 a night. I regret doing so. 60 Thompson is in a nice, quiet location still close to all the shopping and restaurants. Rooms are acceptable in size given they are at a boutique hotel in NY, adequately finished and clean -although not very interesting. Check-in was a little strange. We arrived early, so we gave them our cell number and went to shop and grab a late lunch and drinks. While we were out I called to see if we could upgrade our room from a King Superior to a King Deluxe, as I was having reservations about being in their standard sized room. I was told by the reservationist that a King Deluxe was not available, but, as she hung up, she confirmed that we were remaining in our original reservation \"which is a King Deluxe.\" Before I could clarify whether she meant to say \"King Superior,\" she hung up. I immediately called back to clarify whether we were remaining in a \"King Superior\" and whether she was correct when she told me there weren't Deluxe rooms available. This time I was told by someone else that I was being put in the Superior but Deluxe rooms were available and we could upgrade for an additional $50 or so, which I elected to do. Very minor, but I was surprised that there was this confusion given how small the reservation department was. My wife and I also remarked how beat up the lobby was. This is one of the first things you see when you arrive at the hotel. It really sets the stage for what you expect of the rooms, restaurant and bar, although I think the rooms, restaurant and bar are all in significantly better shape than the lobby. You'd think they'd keep things looking nice. Instead, it looked like wall and floor coverings and furniture had not been touched in a few years. Doormen did a nice job getting us transportation and loaning us umbrellas as we headed out in the rain. Service in the bar was acceptable. I left 60 Thompson disappointed. Not b/c it was a bad stay, but b/c I was expecting something just a little nicer, hipper and more special. When I go back I will either save a few bucks and stay at the SoHo Grand or splurge a few bucks and stay at The Mercer in the hopes of getting the experience I was hoping for at 60 Thompson.", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cNothing special\u201d", "Author": "kelmo123", "ReviewID": "UR15746569", "Content": "I've just returned from a weekend at 60 Thompson from my husband and to be honest we were a little disappointed.

When we arrived in our room, i was really shocked as to how small it was - you couldn't swing a cat. The room was quite drab with no character whatsover. We stayed in that room for 1 night then upgraded to a bigger room. Much more spacious but again, I don't think it was value for money. This is a 'no frills' hotel as far as I'm concerned. There are many more 'boutique' hotels in NYC that would offer much more. Location is great. We ate in the restaurant. Great food, but i felt they rushed us to be honest. Bit of a hit and miss too with the staff. I called up at 1am for some tampax, the receptionist said she'd get back to me, never did. I just thought a phone call even to say they couldn't help would have been nice. We only stayed in the bar for about 15 minutes.

The amenities were awesome. They were by fresh. The bathroom was fine. Water pressure isn't that great but not a problem. They turndown your beds daily and leave a brownie from The Fat Witch which is one of my fave brownie places in NYC. They offer at turndown to fill your ice bucket, etc. Yes, the room is small.

One sleepless night that included crappy service, that is. I was in Soho with some friends celebrating a birthday and we opted to stay at 60T because of the proximity to our activities in/around the neighborhood. I got a decent rate due to the season: $455 (tax incl) for a queen double. My room was on the 3rd floor -- which I should have realized is right above the bar. Ordinarily this may not even be a big deal, save for the fact that at this hotel the bar was totally packed and they pump music until 3am. Speaking of the bar, what a nightmare. We went down there for a drink before dinner and when the hostess was no where to be found, we went in and encountered several empty tables with \"reserved\" signs on them. Eventually she wandered out and rudely told us that we could stay there until 9pm, but then she'd need to kick us out. That was at 7pm, and she seemed exasperated when we said we were only having 1 drink. We stopped by to see if we could get an after dinner reservation before we left, and she stood there ignoring us while hanging up coats for a few minutes before I \"interrupted\" her. Though we should have gone elsewhere, we actually closed down the bar at the hotel, which was okay given that had we chosen to go to bed, we wouldn't have slept with the music going so loudly. What really po'd me, however, was that at 6am people started getting up and flushing toilets which sounded like they were right next to you. The noise from these was amazingly loud and of course lasted through the morning. Our friends on another floor said they were awoken by it as well, and that it actually sounded amplified! I think their walls are made out of tissue paper and spit! Otherwise, the hotel seemed okay. It's not like you get much in NYC for your money. The neighborhood is great. The rooms are small, but everything is brand new. There's a crappy flat panel tv on the dresser, and a cd player/stereo in there too. (BTW, does anyone use cd's anymore?) The toiletries in the bathroom are pretty good. The beds were pretty comfy, with decent linens, which obviously didn't make up for the no-sleep dilemma. I should probably also mention that I was surprised at how clumsy and ill-trained the bellmen are. Though they always seemed to have 2 guys on duty, rarely were they around to open the door or help with bags. They sure love tips though! ;^) During check-out I mentioned that the hotel was really loud and the desk clerk, who also checked us in, kind of snickered and said, \"Oh, well, you were right above the bar.... \" Nice! I just glared out her and replied, \"Well, you checked me into that room so you must have known that. Regardless, we closed down the bar, that wasn't my issue. Your walls are so thin that every time someone flushed the toilet it sounded as if I was in their bathroom with them.\" This was met with no response. None whatsoever. I mentioned that I was from DC and that they have another hotel opening, to which she cheerily replied that 'yes' they did.

The shower was a bit weird- the way it was designed allowed for water to get on the floor, but I guess that's what towels are for...-Our room didn't have a tub unfortunately- but when in NY who has time for a bath, I guess. The restaurant was nice- very swanky. The waiter accomodated to our dietary requests nicely. We ate early , so it was not packed, but it is definitely a place to see and be seen. The other people sitting near us were having some sort of fashion industry meeting- which kept us amused. The only bad thing I could say about the hotel is the sound carrying problem that someone already mentioned. We definitely heard people flushing their toilets/ and water thru the pipes which was a bit odd considering you are in such swanky surroundings. Also- the doors slam if not shut properly, so you constantly hear housekeeping and other guests slamming doors in the morning. You get over it pretty quickly though considering it's NY and you can't escape noise. Again- great neighborhood. Lots of things to do during the day-- and plenty of bars/ late night cafes near the hotel!", "Date": "August 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, good service, average rooms\u201d", "Author": "CD001", "ReviewID": "UR8361947", "Content": "We stayed at 60 Thompson from a Thursday to a Sunday.

Each time we stayed for about a week. It had been about a year and a half since our last visit and we took advantage of a \"good deal\" on the basic queen room at $299. Well $299 doesn't get you much at all in NYC so we were thrilled to find a good deal. And, at 60 Thompson you do get a lot - attentive bellmen, cool staff, rooms where everything works, great showers and a nice bathroom. The Soho location can't be beat. In the past we always upgraded to a larger queen room. It wasn't available for this visit and we sure missed it! It has more room, an extra chair and a view to the front. The standard queen (which is smaller) only has a rear building view and you get some noise from air vents from the building behind the hotel. Our room was neat and clean but there were signs of wear. The couch had a stain and some of the towels seem to be a bit old. (They aren't the same brand they used to have. I used to think 60 Thompson had the thickest towels in NYC!) We also needed to call down for new shampoo and conditioner three out of seven days. The lobby area is very worn looking, with faded fabric pillows and carpeting. I ordered a glass of wine on the rooftop lounge and the reusable plastic glass had a huge crack! Staying there for a week we had a lot of reasons to interact with the staff. They were always attentive and friendly. The bellmen were especially nice and greeted us each day. Any requests we had with the front desk were addressed very quickly. Everyone seems \"on the ball\". It's a pretty cool place and a great location. But it isn't plush. If you can get the premium queen and a room pretty high up I think you will enjoy it a lot. My stay 8 months ago at the Soffitel, the #2 ranked hotel on Tripadvisor in NYC, wasn't as good as 60 Thompson. In NYC I am always grateful for a room under $400 with a good staff, a clean room and air conditioning and plumbing that work. When you add its location it is hard to beat.

They said that nothing on the reservation stated that we had in fact requested non-smoking, and would only be able to switch us to a non-smoking room the following day. (Our confirm clearly said \"non-smoking\"). The hotel claims that when the hotel room is booked via outside reservation agents, the request for non-smoking is not given to them. After insisting multiple times that it was important to us, and going down to the lobby with our confirmation as proof, we finally got an upgrade for the night to a beautiful, large suite. Some complaints about the suite: the wireless Internet didn't work, the TV in the bedroom refused to change channels, and the toilets were so noisy they would have scared small children. Upon checking out, we found on our bill a $10 charge for the Ethernet cable they had provided us when the Wi Fi failed. (We complained and didn't end up having to pay for it). Also upon checkout, we were shocked to find a $220 charge for the minibar, even though we hadn't used anything. Word of warning: I had noticed in both rooms we stayed in (the suite and the regular room the next day) that the minibar did not have full inventory to begin with -- this was probably the source of the discrepancy. Make sure the list provided in the minibar in fact matches the inventory, because some of the items --- \"Intimacy Kit\" ($110++), and Tocca Candle ($50) can run steep. Disappointingly for such an expensive and \"upscale\" hotel, the gym was located in the musty, dark basement level and was a whopping 15x15' room. It included 2 treadmills, one bicycle and one step machine, which, when we were working out, were all occupied. Ventilation is minimal and there are no windows in the room. When I returned home, I realized that I had left my phone charger in the hotel room. When I called to file a search request, the front desk told me to call back the next day when housekeeping arrived. No reassurance, remorse, or any sign of standard procedure here regarding lost items --- while this is acceptable behavior for a $100/night hotel, in my mind it is not for a $400+/night hotel. Overall the staff seemed to be hired for their looks, not their commitment to quality service. On the bright side, the restaurant Kittichai is stunning and the food delicious. The room service menu is abundant with Kittichai selections, which is a delight. The suite we had was gorgeous despite the technical difficulties we had.

We came back 30 minutes after the check in time and were told it still was not ready. They suggested we go to the restaurant and have something to eat. So we did- only to be told at the restaurant that they weren\u2019t serving lunch anymore (Shouldn\u2019t the person at the desk know that?). So we went and sat in the lobby. We thought it was odd that the staff was totally unmoved by the fact that our room wasn\u2019t ready. They just acted like it was totally normal. Our room was finally ready 45 minutes after the stated time, and we found it to be lackluster at best. The \"Superior Room King bedroom\" was very small- probably the smallest hotel room I've had. There was room for the bed and not much more. The room was also stuffy and hot. The windows in our room did not open, and the air conditioner did not work either. It was unseasonably warm during our stay and it would have been lovely to have had the option of not sweating in the room. The staff was not really interested in helping us- they really couldn\u2019t have cared less about us. When the time came for us to leave, I called the front desk and asked for our car, which was parked in their valet lot (the only option for parking). About 15 minutes later we checked out. I went to the desk to pay the bill, while my boyfriend went to wait for the car. There was no store in the hotel, but there was a number of deli's around (it is, after all, new york). We had purchased a few bottles of water and juice for our room in order to avoid paying thru the nose for juice/water that had probably been in the mini bar for 6 months. However, at checkout, I had to defend myself- they were insistent that we took something from the mini bar- but she was unable to tell me what that was. I just checked my charge card- and have a mystery charge on there from the hotel for $6.50. I'm sure I'll spend that and more in long distance fighting this petty charge. Very frustrating. What was even more frustrating, however, was waiting an additional 45 minutes for the car. Despite calling and despite there being no one else waiting for a car- my boyfriend had to go back inside and ask again about the car. So- for some reason it\u2019s at least an hour's wait for our car, which has me wondering where on earth did our car spend the night? Newark?

King Suite was not much of a suite as it only accommodated a small sitting area just adequate for a sofa and table in addition to the bedroom. However we loved the balcony which was the length of the living room and bedroom, we never used the A/C as we could open balcony door in both rooms. Bathroom was very disappointing for a hotel of this standard (no storage place, music or TV in the bathroom). Very little storage place in the room for clothes. Overall the room was finished to a low standard with IKEA quality furniture.

I must first say that we were looking for a place in the heart of the village, and it will be tough to beat the location and atmosphere of 60 Thompson. My main grievance comes with the staff. We had booked a King Deluxe smoking room for the night. We checked in, (they did mention Happy Anniversary) and were shown to our room. The hardwood floors and bathroom were great. We right away noticed it was not a smoking room so I called the front desk to confirm. They relayed to us that in fact it was not a smoking room, but they would send someone up right away with keys to our new room. When we entered the new room, I was shocked. No hard wood floors, tiny bathroom, tiny room. I asked if it was in fact a King Deluxe room and they said they had none of those available in smoking. I was a little disappointed, what happened to the room I had booked, did they give it away? I was told we were moved to a lower level room due to availability. I then mentioned that there must be a rate differance since it was a lower level room, and I was given no cooperation on this and my request for an explanation was denied as they danced around the reason. I had in my hand proof of a guarenteed King Deluxe Smoking room. I ended up paying that rate for a Queen Superior room. Most days I would have let it slide, but on my anniversary, I was dissapointed. As stated before, the location is wonderful and right smack in the middle of the village, close to everything. I have stayed in many hotels in NYC and this was very disappointing in terms of service. Next time I will stay in the Mercer or SoHo Grand. I have stayed in both before, and regret trying out 60 Thompson on such a special night. You may enjoy the roof top bar, it was nice for a drink or tow, bu the heartbeat of the village is down on the street, not in the \"members and gusest only\" rooftop bar. You may find you check in on a day where the staff is on top of their game, but at those prices, they should be on top of their game everytime, every guest, especially those celebrating special occasions.

They brought champagne and generally treated us like royalty. We finished our evening in a small resturant across the street from the hotel called the Country Cafe. The lady who ran the place was lovely and when she heard our news, she promptly brought more champagne! The concierge service downstairs was invaluable as after a hard days shopping, you can forget wading through the guide book for a nice place to eat. They can recommend some great local places and fill you in what's happening locally. They also helped us out with transport back to the airport.

There is a hip attitude pervading the place, as evidenced with the photo shoot occurring in the bar upon our arrival, but we were almost always greeted with warm smiles and very friendly service. The one exception that comes to mind was the concierge desk; they seemed disorganized and hassled, and offered curt responses to requests. Just avoid them. I like smaller sized properties, and this was just perfect in that regard. I also liked the residential feel to the place; it was like staying at a hip friends pied a terre. Room was thoughtfully designed and reasonably sized. Good-sized well-designed marble bathroom with solid water pressure and temperature regulation. Bed was very comfortable, but wouldn't call it memorable. Sheets may be Frette, but really just standard hotel line with a few noticable repairs. Towels were pretty standard and not Frette. Twice a day service kept towels replenished and room in order, but they were slightly skimped on Fresh sugar toiletries. Didn't eat at the property...too many good options nearby. Of note is that Aquagrill is VERY near. And so are Kee's Chocolates! Fantastic location for shopping and exploring. SOHO is in many ways one big mall, which sounds kind of sad, but it's not that bad. WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Room was more skuffed up than I would have liked. Although room 88 was relatively quiet, imperfect seal of windows let it a bit of noise. Spot on chair and marks on furniture were too noticeable. Although visually appealing, some furnishing were of so-so quality, but certainly not as bad as W chain.

I paid $189 on a holiday special, and got upgraded on check-in to a Deluxe King. First of all, let me say that I am young and supposedly hip, that is to say I am Jason Pomeranc (that's Pomerantz)'s key demographic. That settled, Mr. Pomeranc's people know what they are doing. My stay at 60 Thompson kicked off what turned out to be the better part of a long weekend in New York during the transit strike. I stayed at two other hotels, my usual Westin Essex House and the Sheraton New York for the last (emergency) night. I had just spent a week in Canada, so I was a bit weary of hotel-hopping. From the moment I arrived at 60 Thom, I was treated like family. Check in was a breeze, and considering I had a ton of luggage from my week's travels to bring in, the bellman was as cool as could be. I only detected an air of snobbery on one of the bellmen who, thankfully, was pretending to be uninterested in another set of guests. I have a sinking feeling that during a certain time of year, they hire a number of people who can't help having a certain attitude that tends to put off some guests. Moving on... My room, #93 on the ninth floor, faced east toward Soho as all the Deluxe Kings do. The dark hardwood floors and stark furniture give the room a loft feel, especially when you open the windows and let the wind blow the curtains. My first gripe was practical: there isn't enough darn closet space! My closet must have been on a structural column or something because there wasn't one but two areas where it was about 4\" deep - barely enough room for a hanging suitcase and clothes and two hotel bathrobes. The king bed was great, just a massive white cloud ready for the magic to happen on its extremely comfortable mattress. The slick 42\" plasma screen TV came equipped with a DVD player and separate aiwa CD stereo, and they even gave me a cable to connect my laptop to the TV speakers, so I could play whatever music I wanted. This is something they wouldn't do at any of the other hotels I stayed at this trip. As for the rest...well...the \"couch\" made a nice luggage bench, and the big leather chair had no desk so it became a clothes hangar. Ah well, the bed made up for either. The bathroom, with its black-marble walls looked nice, but was just a basic shower...although the shampoo by 'fresh' was very good. All in all, the room was beautiful, but I would have added a sexy Aeron chair and a good working desk. I could definitely live full-time in one of these rooms. One evening, when I wanted to dine in my room but not pay room service over-prices, the front desk gladly gave me a laminated menu book of all local restaurants that deliver. In the case that a restaurant didn't deliver, I was gladly told that they would send someone to pick anything up in the neighborhood. Now, that I haven't seen in a hotel before. This place surprised me. The public areas are well designed and well-kept (although I didn not try the bar and restaurant), the rooms are classic SoHo, and the service is r e a l...all these factors make 60 Thompson an ideal bet, especially if you can get a rate under $200.

The hotel were acting illegally by blocking these fire escapes and I was disgusted by their lack of consideration for guests. Issue 5: Just a general note on the tedious staff and their 'too cool for school' attitude, got very boring after a while and made our stay uncomfortable We had a fantastic time in NY, but felt absolutely ripped off, we paid $500 per night and had a thoroughly annoying experience. It's not even that exciting as a 'style hotel', and we're stayed at enough of these in our time to have a pretty good benchmark.", "Date": "June 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cImpressed\u201d", "Author": "LastMinuteManToronto", "ReviewID": "UR3618291", "Content": "Great little hotel on a quiet street in Soho.

Upon entering the hotel we were greeted by a very friendly and professional doorman. The entrance can be a little confusing because there are 2 lobbies. The ground floor had these lovely fragrant votive candles. The young lady who greeted us here was also very polite and directed us to the \"check-in\" lobby located one floor up. The room itself was heavenly. If you are used to NY standards with regards to space then you will not be disappointed. If you are someone who loves large rooms, then you may want to find another hotel. We found the room sufficient. It was a King superior room, which we got for $175/night - a total steal! The only down side was that the roof top lounge was not open because the weather was not warm enough and there were some renovations taking place. None of which bothered us at all. Also the bathroom was spectacular - even took digital pictures of it so I could redo my own personal restroom at home. The lounge down stairs was also very nice. It was very mellow, more of either a pre or post party place to have a drink. For a place that was so trendy it had no attitude problem, like most of the other NY hotels. (The front desk staff brought me a new toothbrush when i told them i forgot mine.) They were also helpful in recommending a nice massage parlour and made the booking themselves. Besides all that, the hotel is located in the best part of the city. I have lived in Manhattan and if I could ever afford it, I would live in Soho! It is close to lots of restaurants and boutiques. And it's just a beautiful area to walk around. If you have never been to NY then this place will give you the best opinion of the city.

I did a lot of research into hotels/areas and agonised for ages about where to stay. Despite its mixed reviews, I finally settled on 60 Thompson. I have to say I wasn't disappointed. It was our first trip to NYC and a New Yorker friend of mine had urged me to stay in SoHo. This was great advice as the area was fantastic - brilliant atmosphere, excellent shopping, etc. You can walk up to all the tourist spots, but then retreat to the calm of SoHo. I would strongly recommend SoHo to anyone visiting NYC. As I was sitting in the cab from JFK to Manhattan, I was getting a little nervous about the hotel.........after all the mixed reviews about the staff, etc. However, the reception staff could not have been more helpful (yes, they're all great looking, but no harm in that!). Ditto for all the staff - very friendly, helpful and professional. Having been there, I'm really surprised by the comments in other reviews. The hotel design is very cool, but actually really cosy/intimate. Much more intimate than SoHo Grand, where we went for drinks one night. The room was very good, although oddly, there was about an inch gap between the carpet and the door to the room - same applied to all the other rooms. We eventually put one of our bathrobes on the floor to block out the light from the corridor!

First some positives. Fantastic location in the heart of soho. Round the corner from great shops, cafes and restaurants. The hotel's design is great, and our room was very nice. We got a special offer through quikbook, and paid $250 per night, which was good value in my view. We ate in the bar one night, and the food was very good. Ate from the thai tapas menu, and although pricey, the food was very nice. Despite the quality of the room, and the hotel in general, the staff are really quite unique. My first experience of the 60's staff was when the bell boy carried our bags to our room. I tipped him $10, he said thanks, and he left. So far so good. Within ten minutes, i had reason to go downstairs, where I bumped into the guy holding my $10. I said \"how are you\"? to which he replied by looking at me as if I had ------ in his cornflakes. You may think he didn't hear me, but I can assure you, he was right next to me, and heard loud and clear. The point I'm trying to make, is that the staff at this hotel have so much attitude, it's unreal. The guys on the door show little interest in opening doors. The reception staff can't even bring themselves to raise their eyes to speak to you, prefering to conduct a conversation whist looking at their computer. It's strange this, as they were quick to respond to other requests. For example I asked for an adoptor to charge my phone and they were very prompt. It seems to be only in face to face discussions, that they disgrace themselves. A genuinely bizarre experience dealing with the staff here.

We got corporate rates of $250. I received room 59 upon check-in and it is not at all a special room -- standard NY crunch. There was no desk, although there was a long rectangular table nested under a higher, square table that served as a nightstand, so I pulled out the long rectangular table and used it as a desk, when I was either sitting on the couch or the large lounge chair. If you have need of back support to do any work, this won't work well for you. Unfortunately, pulling that table out took up most of the remaining available footprint. Two people can't walk past each other at the same spot in this room. When I arrived in room 59, there was no shampoo (although there were other amenities), the phone didn't work and no flower in the vase (supposed to be an orchid in a little square glass vase with pebbles). I didn't realize this until turndown service came and filled my ice bucket, at which point I tipped $2 -- then the service rep graciously noted that my flower was missing and brought me one. In my opinion, even the corporate rate of $250 was just a bit much for this room -- a fairer price would be under $200. My boss' experience was different -- when he went to check in, they informed him there was no room for him even though he had a guaranteed reservation. However, they did offer to pay to put him up at the Soho Grand that night and the next night, they appear to have upgraded him to a much larger suite, Room 100, which they comp'd (this must be what is normally the $400/night room. It was nice of them to comp him, but then he was really quite upset that the reservation hadn't been honored). This is a truly large room, with a separate sleeping area and an enormous entertaining space with a ponyskin area rug. There is a proper desk, two TVs (one of them flat screen LCD) and two bathrooms. Cookies were in the room as part of the suite service. Amenities in both rooms were by Fresh. Suite Room 100 had a wood floor. Standard Room 59 had carpeting. Both rooms had king beds. The service, as has been noted elsewhere, was exceptional (despite my boss not getting a room on his guaranteed reservation and with the exception of turndown service, who I suspect might not have offered me that flower until the tip was forthcoming -- but at least the tip urged an offer of a flower). Room service was exceedingly polite, intelligent and thoughtful. As has been noted elsewhere, the neighborhood is choice. The weather in NY was sub-zero, so we walked two and a half blocks turning right out of the hotel and found this little basement Cubana restaurant (called, I think, the Cubana Cafe or something like that) at which was the best grilled corn with hot spice and cheese and ethereally fresh chicken soup. Available for a song and delectable (and hot!) Overall, I'm torn as to whether to stay again (I don't think I would want a room like 59 at $250 again, but nor do I think it would be fair to get a room like 100 at the price of $250 -- if only they had something in between!).", "Date": "January 22, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "60 Thompson - A Thompson Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d93398-Reviews-60_Thompson_A_Thompson_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$338 - $1,19", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">60 Thompson Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10012</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514616", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/20/ff/de/60-thompson.jpg"}}
