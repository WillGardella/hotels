The seat had been left up and there were \"dried drops\" on the rim of the bowl. If housekeeping cleans anything in the room it should be the toilet. If that is not clean, everything else is suspect. There were also sticky smears on the furniture that could have easily been wiped off. I am not a snob or a particularly fussy person. I can adapt to used furniture and tired beds, but I will not tolerate filth. I highly recommend you stay elsewhere. This place need a total overhaul. I also hate the fact that you have to go to the office in the morning to have them remove the safe fee. When I went to the office it was closed.
