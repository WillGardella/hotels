We had four large rooms, including full kitchen, dining room, living room and bath. This all for about $200. per night. Although the hotel does not have a cafe, room service or other conventional amenities, the immediate neighborhood offers these services in abundance. Turn right and there's a well stocked market; turn left and find Cup a Joe, a wonderful urban coffee shop/cafe. The location boasts easy access to tourist enclaves like Union Square and authentic residential settings like Pacific Heights, or you can trek through the panhandlers of the Tenderloin to SOMA. Rent a car around the corner at Hertz for $40.00 per day, all in. The kitchen had everything we needed although we mercifully ate most meals out. Wireless was free and though the two large flat screens are not high def, they have tons of offerings. The wire cage elevator is fun and there are two set of stairs that anchor the wide, pleasant central hallway.

Not only was I not disappointed in my choice, but my expectation were exceeded far greater than I could have even asked for. If you read some of the other reviews here you will notice the resident manager Dimitar's name all over the place. The reason for this is the guy is exceptional. Upon arrival there weren't any studio rooms available, so he instantly upgraded me without flinching. He was full of information about San Francisco and was not only pleasant to deal with, but gave all the time needed. Nothing was a stress for this guy and there were no pressures at all in my stay. Obviously the room is one of the most important things, and the room I stayed in was a one bedroom apartment. The room was clean and spacious, with a large comfortable bed. There was a small TV in the bedroom and a large flatscreen in the lounge. The room had a full kitchen, complete with stove, oven, microwave and fridge. The bathroom was spacious also, with plenty of full length mirrors. Upon arriving in my room I unpacked all of my clothes into the closet and drawers, as this place really felt like a small apartment one might live in. I really felt at home here and it was such a shame to leave. One thing that people need to realise before they decide on making their booking is what type of building they want to stay at. If you are after a hotel with doormen, room service and the like this place is not for you. The Steinhart is a gorgeous apartment complex that provides a stay in a great part of San Francisco in a contemporary apartment. The elevator is classic old school and the lobby is beautiful. There are laundry facilities downstairs should you wish to use them. This place is the perfect place to stay if you're looking to go about your business at your own convenience and don't require all of the minor things that hotels do. I noticed that on my trip I stayed at hotels, but lived at the Steinhart. This was such a big difference. The location is another thing that this place has going for them. They're located in a quiet street, only 8 minutes walk from Union Square. One can easily walk to Union Square and bypass the Tenderloin completely (which is 2-3 blocks away). SF has a big homeless problem, but thankfully there weren't any homeless people around where I was staying. The Steinhart still has double security doors with keycodes (which they give you upon arrival) to add that extra layer of security. Across the street is a great coffee shop if you want to grab a morning coffee and bagel. Three doors down is a grocery store, which is perfect to stock up the full kitchen. Next door to the grocery store is Aces bar, which is open until late 7 days and plays all major sporting games. My stay in San Francisco was one of the greatest experiences of my life because of the comfort, location and friendly staff at the Steinhart. I'm already clamoring to head back to SF and there is no doubt in my mind I will stay there again.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Apartment Hotel full of Character !\u201d", "Author": "Champagne4everyone", "ReviewID": "UR121165635", "Content": "We had a fantastic stay here earlier this year and the place is quirky and spunky.

Although the Tenderloin is close it is easily avoidable with a map and little research, which anyone travelling should do when going to a city they don't know. We did not at any time feel uncomfortable walking about the city but we did avoid the Tenderloin. Again, with a little research on bus routes and the incredible deal you get from MUNI for a bus pass, we were able to navigate the city with little effort. From the airport take BART to downtown (Market & Powell), purchase your bus pass from a kiosk next to the Powell Street cable car turnaround, walk half a block to Syril Magnin and hop on the 27 bus to Sutter and walk half a block to hotel.

I absolutely loved it - I cannot stress this enough. I wondered why this hotel was so cheap, upon my arrival, I found out why. The neighborhood is like a shantytown. I walked from the BART station to the hotel (a 5 minute walk) and I actually felt scared (I am usually not threatened in this situation at all). I was surrounded by at least 70 aggressive people on my short journey shouting and fighting on the streets. The roads emitted an overwhelmingly strong smell stale urine. It is EVERYWHERE and you cannot escape the stench, it literally took your breath away - I have never experienced anything like it. Every time I left the hotel I was in the same situation - people fighting and screaming and stale urine. I have noted that many reviewers of hotels state that their hotel was in a bad area, and I usually found this an unfair assessment. I have stayed at some of these hotels and whilst there was the occasional homeless person, it was really not that bad. As beautiful as this hotel was - it actually wrecked my SF experience - I left not wanting to ever come back to SF again. I wanted to just stay in my lovely hotel room - but for all the wrong reasons. Luckily I had to come back later in my trip (which I was dreading) and stayed at a hotel on Market street and my love for SF was reignited.

I would hate for people to book this hotel without knowing the good and the bad in order to make an informed decision. I wish I had known.

Later, because her friend decided to join us, I changed the booking to a one bedroom apartment. The hotel looked fantastic and full of character in photographs, but I was puzzled about two things: the low number of reviews and one review noting concerns about security. I can only think that the number of reviews reflects the fact that most people stay in San Francisco for shorter periods than the 7 nights required at the Steinhart, because this is an exceptional find. I value security highly, but this was also not a problem. As other reviews have noted, staying at the Steinhart is like having your own clean and stylish San Francisco apartment, and while the front desk is not always attended, there is a phone number for contact and two levels of security at the hotel entrance, so this is absolutely not a problem. The Steinhart blew us away. We loved the old lift, the collection of books and sitting area on the 1st floor, and the interior decorating. The apartment was incredibly spacious, with sliding doors between bedroom, lounge and dining area so you could reconfigure the space. It also had heaps of storage, a fully equipped kitchen (with dishwasher) and extremely comfortable beds. There's a tv in the bedroom and in the lounge. The dining area was nice and sunny. Just one thing about this, and all the other US hotels we stayed in - only a coffee maker is supplied. While at some other hotels this caught me out, at the Steinhart you at least have a microwave, coffee maker or stove if you want a cup of tea. There are laundry facilities in the hotel basement as well as a laundromat literally next door. What's more, there's no need to stock up on food because there are two convenience stores just a few doors away, a pizza shop, a gelataria and a great cafe. In fact, this area of Sutter Street is full of shops, and it's just a quick walk to Union Square, China Town is around the corner and it's also within walking distance of Fishermans Wharf. This level of convenience has one downside and that's a bit of noise from traffic. While we're used to complete silence at home, we didn't find this problematic. The staff at this hotel couldn't have been more efficient or friendly. They were quick to respond to all my initial email enquiries. They sent a reminder notification about my booking, and a follow up email after I had left.

I've stayed at Ritz Carltons and Four Seasons....but I've never stayed at a hotel that cared as much as this one.

I had to have a place to bring him when he got out of the hospital and it had to be comfortable and homey for his recovery. I also had to have a kitchen. I first tried another popular long term hotel and found it to be shabby and worn. We were so delighted when we checked into the Steinhart. While it is an old hotel...it is really beautiful....Lovely woods and fixtures....great old cage elevator and updated rooms with comfortable beds, flat screen TV's and a full kitchen. We had a room with a livingroom (Murphy bed TV, small dining table, sofa, chairs, etc.), large bedroom (with the flat screen, DVD +++) a kitchen with stove, microwave, diswasher, refrigerator, all dishware and cooking utensils, pots and pans. The manager, Peter Friedman is a saint. He has been so good to us. He's helped us in countless ways and always with a smile and compassion. He assisted me in long term parking for the car, transferring luggage back and forth to the hospital and extended many other little kindnesses and comforts for us. We stayed there before the surgery and are about to return tomorrow for two weeks of recovery. I can't say enough for the way the staff (at the Vertigo next door who takes care of staffing this hotel) jumps to solve any problem... This is the perfect place for a long term stay in San Francisco....A short walk to Union Square on a street loaded with little sandwich shops, coffee places, small markets (two blocks to a big one) and even gelato and pizza next door. Two doors away is a great sandwich shop with fresh roasted chickens every day. I felt like I lived in the neighborhood after just a few days. And did I mention, a laundry in the basement! Do not hesitate to stay in this lovely little hotel....it is just so charming.

It is a few blocks north of the edge of the Tenderloin, but a few blocks makes a big difference in San Francisco. It's more in the Nob Hill area really, without too much of the hill (an important factor with a 6-month old baby in a stroller) - actually just a gentle incline up Sutter Street from Union Square. We couldn't really find any faults. We rented a car a couple of times and overnight street parking is tricky, but possible with a bit of looking around, and certainly not the worst in San Francisco. Of course you can also pay for overnight parking in various lots.
