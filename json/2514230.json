Knew the property was being renovated and were prepared for some inconvenience. However, we encountered none. Very positive experience. LOCATION: The Milford Plaza is at 8th and 44th - in the middle of the theatre district, a block from Times Square and short walk to Restaurant Row. After checking in, we wandered over to Fifth Avenue, then down to Bryant Park, and over to Macy's. It really is a super location! ROOM: Nicely renovated corner room with queen bed on the 7th floor. Contemporary furnishings. View of Planet Hollywood at Times Square and several theaters. Noise was not an issue. The room and bath were bright and squeaky clean. Plenty of room for two. Only a slight problem with where to lay out our second suitcase. Solved this by using the desk chair. Not an issue that would prevent us from staying here again. STAFF: The ladies at the front desk were very professional, but could have been a bit more cheerful. The bartender was excellent. Yes, it was a temporary bar setup, but there were votive candles on the tables and even small bowls of snacks. Actually, better than we expected given the renovations. As I said above, housekeeping provided us with a very clean room and bath. VALET PARKING: I think we paid $45. Very prompt and courteous service. NEARBY RESTAURANTS: Shake Shack is across the street -- very good Chicago dogs, hamburgers looked good too. Playwrights Celtic Pub is a small neighborhood-type bar a block north of the Milford. Several deli's both north and south on 8th. Enjoyed our dinner at Becco on Restaurant Row. OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We would definitely like to return. Although after the renovations are complete, we may not be able to afford it. ;-)", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mandeville, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, awesome location\u201d", "Author": "Rick J", "ReviewID": "UR127348727", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at this hotel...the location is amazing, the staff was really nice and helpful.

I paid $620 for 4 nights, the room was small but clean (and had an all important iPod docking station!), and staff were attentive and polite. Once checked in I realised my room did not have a safe, reception staff quickly changed me to a room with a safe and the duty manager offered me 50% off my room for that night due to the inconvenience. Can't say fairer than that I think! Maid service once per day; new towels, bedding, toiletries etc. only criticism is the elevators are a pretty arduous affair - you have to wait a good 4 or 5 mins for a lift, and then stopping at various floors on the way down at busy periods means that a trip from the 25th floor to ground level can take over 10 mins! If a bit of chipped paint on the wall is going to offend you then find somewhere else to stay.

Cost averaged out to about $145 a night, which was amazing compared to some of the many other more expensive places we looked at before booking the Milford. We asked for a room with a view and got a newly renovated corner room with King bed on the 11th floor (#1108), even though the booking said it was only supposed to be a Queen. Check-in was quick and the receptionist was very nice. The room was a good size and not small at all, very modern and clean, including the bathroom. It still smelled like it had been freshly renovated. Flat-screen tv, iron, in-room safe, hair dryer, nothing was missing. Bed was very comfortable, lots of pillows and sheets were clean. We had two adjacent windows with excellent views along 8th ave and 44th. I don't think the windows have been replaced so you do hear street noise but with the a/c turned on (it was a warm week) we barely heard the traffic. We spent most of our days out and about so didn't spend much time in the room. If I had to find minor complaints I'd say that house-keeping didn't come around on one day and on our last morning there was some jack-hammering/construction noise somewhere close by. But since we were checking out that morning, we weren't too bothered. Also wireless internet is something like $14/day (which we didn't opt for). The PCs in the lobby take a minimum $5 for access. Valet parking is steep at this hotel. We chose to park at a nearby Icon for $25/day. Location is excellent. This hotel is right in the thick of it all. Step out right onto 8th avenue. Time Square is around the corner. Had a great stay and was very happy with the price paid and the quality of the (renovated) rooms. Will the hotel raise its prices once the renos are complete?

Yes, the rooms are small, but I did not expect to be in my room all that much. My bathroom had a traditional door, and it looked like the door trims were original and just painted over. There was still some odor of new paint and carpet adhesive and one drawer in one of the bedside modules was out of alignment. The only real drawback was a near total absence of electrical outlets; there was just an old one in a corner - nothing near the desk/work area. The LED desk lamp would not turn off; it is either on low or high. The bathroom, though compact, was very clean. As with all of the rooms since the renovation, the furniture is rather euro, basically white laminate modules.. One wall sports a bright graphic (mine was the green 'Open 24 Hours' version). The HVAC system worked just fine and there was always plenty of hot water. The lobby is cramped and dated, but that is also going to be renovated soon. As a have a minor mobility issue, the fact that only one elevator goes to the ground floor was a little inconvenient. As others have noted, the elevator system is a bit unusual, but I never had to wait long. By planning ahead, I got a very reasonable rate.

I thought americans prided themselves in good customer service but I was incredibly let down by her attitude with me over the fact that they couldn't accept my card. She repeated several times in a rude loud voice \" We don't accept that card\". Then told me that I would have to get money out down the street and again kept repeating the same thing. She made me so angry I told her \"ok ok\" and walked away from the desk, she then turned around to my friend and said \"you know if she doesn't come back we will be charging to your credit card\" in a rude manner. She was bang out of order and she would not have not been to able to authorise that. She ruined my morning with her attitute. I of course I am an honest person and had she been nicer to me I would have apologised profusely for the inconvience.

There were workers right outside the window ( and our room was on the 21 floor ) so we could not even open the window !! The room was very very small and no closet-space for all the luggage. Had to keep all our stuff on the floor and could hardly walk in the room because of so litle space. The hallway was painted black and was very dark, narrow and creepy.

So the whole vacation went by without getting a workout done and that really really pissed me off. They should have at least posted it on the website that the gym would be closed.

Yes, the hotel is undergoing a massive rennovation--it was built in 1928 for goodness sake! I knew this ahead of time and expected some glitches. My 20 year old daughter and I stayed in a rennovated king on the 17th floor for $115/night TravelZOO promo for four nights! The room was a nice size, clean, bed and pillows comfy. Okay so the bathroom is small, but it has the essentials! Our room had no tub, but a large shower which definitely is poorly designed as the tile was not built up high enough and the shower curtain too short so water splashed everywhere--hopefully the staff will address this issue to avoid future water damage. Most importantly, the water was hot. A couple of times we heard some knocking from the rennovation, but once again I was prepared for this. We also had a very hot room, but guess what? We turned off the unit when it was obvious the thermostat wasn't working properly. I called and the maintenance guy named Fausto came right away to try to remedy the problem, but he agreed the thermostat wasn't working properly. The AC actually worked for us...for a while--LOL! Unlike some reviewers, I NEVER heard other guests in my location. Moreover, we had a safe in our room; therefore, we locked up \"valuables.\" Who would go to NYC or any hotel and not do that? If a safe wasn't in the room, I would have asked for one at the desk, etc. Furthermore, if I saw bugs, I would have asked for another room or left immediately, wouldn't you?....The lobby--\"run down\"??? NO, what I saw was all new---but I did not look behind the black curtain to see what was being rennovated or to see if \"the wizard\" was standing there conjuring up \"Wicked\" experiences for unsuspecting guests....As far as the staff, I personally talked to at least ten employees and they were all very helpful from the bellhops to the front desk folks to the people who serviced the rooms. I NEVER had a problem with the elevator. If you like a more European style hotel with a historic past, enjoy being around international guests, and can tolerate a few inconveniences due to the rennovations, the Milford Plaza is a great deal. If you want to spend three times the $$$ for more \"luxury\" go somewhere else. There is no way their employees can be more helpful or accommodating than what I experienced at Milford Plaza. Furthermore, the location is terrific! We walked to Macy's, K Mart--yes, K Mart near Macy's--check it out for snacks, etc.),the Hudson River/Intrepid Museum (have lunch at Ollie's Noodles on 42nd and 9th on the way there), Rockefeller Center,Lincoln Center, and from the Guggenheim all the way down 5th Ave back to the hotel via Central Park. Try John's Pizza and cheescake at Junior's, both around the corner. Had burgers and shakes from the Shake Shack across the street--much more reasonable than Junior's. Also if you like historic buildings, check out the famous NYC Public Library next to Bryant Park--free tours. We had a mini fridge and bought a few things at Food Emporium a couple of blocks up 8th toward Columbus Circle--they have terrific salads, sandwiches, pastries, and hot bar. For discounted theater tickets, don't stand in line at TKTS booth, check out Playbill.com, get promo codes and buy tickets at the theaters (check out section on student and general RUSH tickets). If you stay at Milford Plaza, you will have extra $$$ like us and can pay to see a non-discounted play like Lion King--it was the best Broadway, London, or Vegas play I have ever seen!", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "WXUT", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel, centrally located, helpful folks, clean, bright\u201d", "Author": "Leathab", "ReviewID": "UR125720508", "Content": "This was the most restful, easiest to find, closest to all the theaters...hotel.

I didn't care for the busyness because it too almost 10 mins to go up & down the elevator, which is ridiculous! Their elevators are situated very strange. There is one electronic box that you type your floor number into & the elevator deccides what elevator will take u. I stayed on highest floor - 27th, so the elevator could stop on as many as 5 floors. It was so annoying & frankly took too much time! And elevator was so small with many people squeezingin & I felt clasterphobic. I was very irritated. Simply, there was just too many people in this hotel always coming& going and checking in and out.. Lines for check in, to drop bag, was just too long. Funny though late at night (11pm or later) the hotel is quiet. Drawback, their 1 hotel ar closes at 11pm - what????

They have no restaurant (they send you to neary restaurant Daniela's to redeem your free continental breakfast), which I think is lame. Who wants to walk off location to eat breakfast? Its a hotel with 600+ rooms. They should be able to cater in a continental breakfast.

Since, I was going solo on this trip it was no big deal to me, but it may be an aggravation to some. The front desk staff was fairly friendly. The room was neat except for the bathroom. The bathroom had what appeared to be dried urine on the toilet seat and the area in front of the toilet was shall we say \"splotchy\" as well. I called the front desk and someone was sent up to clean the bathroom within about 15-20 minutes. I'm not sure how something like this could be over looked, but the person that came up did a thorough job cleaning the toilet, shower/ tub and sink. The walls in the room must not be insulated very well as I often heard doors slamming and people talking in the hall.

Now, this probably is more efficient on normal days, but imagine having a busload of high school students ALL TRYING TO GET UP TO THEIR FLOORS...and shortly thereafter, ALL TRYING TO GET TO THE LOBBY. We wasted 30 minutes because of the elevators, as we waited forever and watched each elevator pass by because it was full from another floor. Not fun. 2. The rooms are small. I'm fine with that, but NOT fine with the thin walls. Every time someone closed their door in my hallway, I jumped (and I'm not even really sensitive to noise!)

Since my room was prepaid and there is no restaurant in the hotel, I couldn't figure out why the hotel needed to place a hold on a credit card, but that is a minor issue. What bothered me more was the $14.95 per day for wi-fi and the $5.00 minimum charge to access the internet from the computers in the lobby. Fortunately, I found a FedEx a couple blocks away that only charged $.30 a minute with no minimum. I did like how you had to enter your floor number into a key pad to be directed to the appropriate elevator and the front desk staff was polite. The clerk did confuse me when I checked out because she asked if I wanted to keep my room charge on the same credit card, but I had prepaid.

You could not get a better location then this. It is being redeveloped. Lobby looks fantastic, with somewhat helpful staff. The beds were so confortable!

Because of this original booking I was still obviously on their mailing list and when considering whether or not we could afford to go to this year the decision was made easier by getting the offer of the $99 renovated rooms. It was also good to start to see the vastly improved reviews of these rooms coming through on trip advisor. We arrived on 11 Feb for 6 Nights and were given Room 2010 a single Queen Size room. Check in was quick and efficient and before long we were up in the room. As stated by many others the room was small with an exceptional small bathroom but too be honest it was more than adequate for two people unless you were determined to share the batroom at the same time. The Room (The Good) Clean with daily linen changes. Decent sized TV with plenty of channels Black out currents keeping the room in total darkness when needed The Room (The bad and the Ugly) Lack of sockets meant that a number of gadgets had to be charged in the bathroom The finishings on a number of items was poor - not enough to downgrade the hotel but if i was in charge of the renovations i would like someone to have made sure the worked did what they were meant to do. The hotel (The Good) Location a block for Times Square and within a few minutes walk of the main theatres, subways, fast food and normal restaurants. The price - hopefully this stays for a while Staff where helpful and corteous with even the cleaning staff having a smile and a good morning when passing. The hotel (The bad) Having to pay for internet access - not a deal breaker but would still be nice if it were complimetary. The lifts - These are hit and miss due to the way thhey operate get there when no ones is around and there is not a problem. Get there when the crowds are back from shows or a bus or party of students arrive then you can expect a long wait. Lack of anywhere to dine within the hotel is again not a deal breaker but would be nice and it is something which may be resolved when all the renovations are done. Summary A very clean, and comfortable hotel that provided you get a renovated room will be more than adequate for your stay in New York City. At the price point of $99 I can highlly recommend it but would like to give the hotel a word of warning, dont put up your prices too much in the future as the facilites will not justify it and location alone would not make me choose the Milford over anoter hotel.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location - good value!\u201d", "Author": "Mandy C", "ReviewID": "UR124768670", "Content": "My daughter and I stayed here for herr 18th birthday!

I recently spent three nights at this hotel and can, without a doubt, say that I WILL return. And honestly, how much time do you really plan to stay in a hotel in NYC, anyway? You're in the city that never sleeps -- get out there and explore! The hotel is conveniently situated just a couple of blocks from the Port Authority Bus Station (drop point for the NYC Airporter shuttle - $12.50 from LGA, $15.00 from JFK), the A/C/E Subway stop ($2.50 subway, $5.00 AirTrain transfer to JFK), a block from Times Square, and in the heart of the theater district. Taking advantage of the close proximity to the TKTS booth at Times Square, I managed to take in three Broadway and off-Broadway musicals during my three night stay - all shows were within a couple of blocks of the hotel. (If you're looking for a great comedy/musical, I'd recommend NEWSical the Musical, Avenue Q and/or How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying). There were also food options, galore, surrounding the Milford - Shake Shack was right across the street; Starbucks and McDonalds within a couple hundred yards. Lots of local eateries on 9th Avenue, as well. Food Emporium was just a few blocks away. Looking for last minute, forgotten toiletries? There's a Duane Reade (24 hours) just across from the Port Authority Bus Station. On to the hotel, itself: I stayed in a recently renovated Queen room - #2603. The room was average-sized for NYC, but fresh and clean. The design of the room was sleek and well laid-out. The room was quiet, too -- either I had no neighbors (unlikely - the hotel seemed very busy), or the walls were well insulated (let's go with that explanation). As a light sleeper, I slept comfortably through the night. The room was also equipped with black-out shades -- an absolute must for anyone sensitive to light. The bathroom was small, but for a single person, it was more than enough space. They definitely got it right when it came to the fixtures. It looked very modern and new -- lots of glass and chrome/stainless steel. The shower had great pressure (no tub), but be careful as you could accidentally flood your bathroom (the shower curtain was barely long enough to reach the lip of the shower). Despite other reviewers mentioning the ongoing construction, I heard none of it. I'm not sure which part of the building is undergoing the renovation at the moment, but I had no issues with sounds or noise (I was there Saturday-Tuesday). The only times that I could hear any noise outside was if a neighbor slammed their door in the hallway, or if an emergency vehicle was blaring its horn on the street (and even then, it wasn't bothersome). Be aware that (at least for my room), there was a balcony that looked as if it was shared with a neighbor. The windows to the rooms were fully openable, and didn't seem to lock -- I didn't go out onto the balcony, so I don't know if the windows could be opened from the outside, but just be aware of this possible security issue. Others mentioned issues with a lack of outlets. I didn't have this issue - my room had more power outlets than I knew what to do with them -- all conveniently situated around the bed and desk areas. Would I stay here again? Absolutely. The hotel is situated in a great location, the room and amenities were well-appointed and for the price, it is very difficult to beat ($99/night). I was in town for a trade-show, so its location along the shuttle routes was very convenient.

Cannot fault the location at all - It\u2019s in Time Square and right opposite a subway station which will take you to most locations both uptown and downtown. The rooms are average in size. We noticed in some reviews people quoting that they were small but compared to most European hotels we have stayed the size matched up well for hotels in this price and star bracket. We arrived around 3pm and were promptly greeted by the check in staff. We asked for a renovated room with a views of time square, the lady was more than happy to accommodate our request. The room we were given was fine however it was a connecting room so we could hear the neighbours next door. We asked for this to be changed which is was and we were provided a similar room with views on the top floor. Having now seen 2 rooms I can confirm the two were similar in size. All rooms have flat screen TV\u2019s and an iPod docking station which was handy bathrooms varied in size. Only negative point was the heating as it was cold we turned the heating on which was fine except for the fact that it made random noises which was annoying if you\u2019re trying to sleep. The noise would come and go but as we were so tired from our exploration we ignored it and slept well. The beds where Queen size and comfy. Linen and towel were changed on a daily basis. We left items (shopping) in the room daily and they were never moved or missing. The views of time square were great even better as we could hear the celebrations from the people of NY when the Giants won the SuperBowl. There are renovations going on, this is mainly noticeable from the outside of the hotel as there is scaffolding all around. Inside we could not see or hear any works. In regards to location and services there is no shortage of places to eat or shop nearby. Time Square is only a 2 min walk, there is a McDonalds and Starbucks within 200 yards of the hotels along with gifts shops etc.. Shake Shack (burgers) is across the road and there are many more places to eat and drink all within walking distance. We found the location to be excellent for our exploration. Most midtown attractions including, Central Park, Macys, Empire State are all within walking distance. Downtown and Brooklyn are all accessible via the subway which is safe and cheap. Watch out for rouge taxi drivers from the Airport to Manhattan. We were duped by one on the way in which cost us an extra $40. Stick to yellow cabs regardless of what they say or quote. There is flat rate for yellow cabs the extra is for town cars which I think we got. On our return we opted for a shared taxi arranged by the Hotel concierge this was paid in advance and pick up was from the hotel at an agreed time. Its saves a bit of money compared to a normal taxi.

Personel was unresponsive to many issues that were not okay. Then the manager would show some kind of response, but one could tell not much was done with it, probably similar to all quick responses written in response to any bad reviews posted on this website. As I have many stories to pick from, I will just limit myself to one example. I came in for the New York marathon a couple of days early and was sick with the flue trying hard to recover. The heating was turned off, which with a flue beginning of November in NY is not optimal, to say the least. I called three times out of my bed to request someone to come and take a look, and the constant response was that it would switch on automatically at an outside temperatur of 50 degrees Fahrenheit. All good, but I told them that in my room it was for sure already approaching that temperature. The smart answer I got was:\" Well Sir, it is probably the case that it is colder in your room than outside.\" How does that work, I wondered. Do you actively cool the rooms at Milford Plaza? Anyway, I decided to ignore that and stated that November new york 8.00 PM, it is for sure way below 50, which it was. It took me three calls to get the same answe three times and nobody wanted to come up. Finally I went downstairs and one would think it can then be arranged quickly, as one would expect some service face-to-face at the frontdesk, right? Wrong! It took three one-to-ones with an uninterested open-mouthed gum-chewing staff, which looked like they could not care less giving empty promisses before anybody was sent. At 22.30 (2.5 hours after starting the attempts) finally somebody arrived at my door, to simply open up the heater and change some screws and vaults, so that the heating was no longer set to vacant. In short, something drasticall needs to change in the management and the staffs attitude at this place, to realize that a hotel is built to make a customer have a pleasent stay.

The hotel is one block from Times Square and directly across from a Subway entrance so there isn't a better location in NYC. The rooms are small but it is to be expected in NYC. There is a bed, a desk, chair, set of drawers & a small closet. There is enough room to walk around the objects but not much else. The bathroom is also petite but there was enough space for a week's worth of sundries, make up, etc. The staff was extremely courteous. The evening before I arrived I called to tell them I would be arriving early in hopes of being able to get into my room before 4pm. Not only were they able to accommodate me but they also noticed the room rate had decreased since I made my original reservation & adjusted the reservation to extend the lower rate. The hotel housekeeping was attentive & did a fine job. The room was clean, there were no reports of bed bugs when I was there (a huge problem in NYC) and the towels & bedding were always fresh & crisp. TIp #1 - Make sure you get a renovated room. TIp#2 - There are no coffee makers in the room & the hotel does not anticipate adding them Coffee is available in the lobby shop. Tip #3 - When you enter or leave the room make sure you pull the door completely shut behind you. The doors do not slam completely closed as in some hotels. If you assume the door is going to automatically close behind you it is likely you are Saving the door open. Tip #4 - Keep an eye out for room rate promotions even after you have made a reservation. They are happy to revise your reservation even if it is less than 24 hours prior to check in.

Having read some of the poor reviews we decided to write To Ms Diane Devine seeking a number of assurances, we received a very prompt and courteous reply covering all of the points that had been raised. We arrived around 8pm and were pleasantly surprised to be met at the kerbside and our bags taken care of by a most helpful bellboy. We were checked in efficiently and our bags were waiting at our room door which was on the 23rd floor. We had a newly renovated room with twin beds and although it was not huge, we found it adequate for two people, it was very clean and smelled new, we had a great view down 8th Avenue, the beds were amongst the most comfortable that I have slept in while staying in a hotel, the bathroom, again, not huge but adequate complete with a good supply of towels, soap, shampoo etc, together with a most efficient shower unit. Being a cautious person, I decided to check out the stairways as these were indicated as fire exits and I always like to check the emergency exit in any hotel. Probably a little over the top but I walked down all 23 floors twice in checking out 2 stairways and noted that they were clear all the way down, no obstructions, good lighting, just a little dust and builders rubble which I expected as the lower floors in the hotel were still being renovated. We had no problem with the 4 elevators which served our floor only having to wait minutes every time we were looking to use one of them. The location is of course excellent, just minutes from Times Square, Broadway and The Port Authority Station etc. Although I had stayed at The Milford some years ago and thought that I knew my way round, the staff were happy to answer any questions, they brought out maps, drew sketches for us to ensure that we found our way around easily, they made sure that we understood the subway system and pointed out where to eat, we could not have asked for more. In particular the housekeeping staff were most pleasant with usually a cheery 'Good Morning'. When it was time to leave, our request for a late afternoon check out was not a problem and the concierge arranged a bus to the airport.

He told us that we had \"one of the good A/Cs, because it still heats the room, other guests are freezing\". We were surprised that he couldn't do anything about the temperature. So we opened the window to the max (about 5cm) and went for dinner. After returning (about 1 hour later), the room was still way too hot! So we complained again and they sent the engineer again to our room. Meanwhile, we found out that the heat was coming from the bathroom floor, he told us that we (obviously) cannot turn it off. Best thing he told us: They had problems with the A/C for months, but cannot solve it. So we went to the check-in again to complain, but they didn't care at all. To make matters worse, she mocked us because it was freezing outside and we were complaining about a room that was too hot. But it was not just that, the room is simply not renovated. The bathroom door cannot be closed properly (and I don't mean locked, the door cannot be CLOSED). The room smelled weird and we couldn't get rid of the feeling that we paid way too much for that and that we are just getting ripped of. Last but not least, you wait forever for the elevators. They couldn't offer us ANY alternative, so we booked another hotel (the Belvedere) for about the same price. That hotel was great, we were so relieved and confirmed that our feeling about this hotel being to expensive was just right! We spent one night at the Milford (didn't sleep well though because of the heat and open window) and changed the hotel right on the next morning. Don't book this hotel and if you booked, cancel! It is really not worth it, you will just be disappointed. As I saw on tripadvisor.com, Diane Devine, Manager at Milford Plaza Hotel is answering all the bad reviews with a standard text. I have news for you: In a city like NYC, where there are hundreds if not thousands of hotels, nobody will give you a second chance. You act in a very short-term oriented manner, not realizing that you will loose a lot of customers like that in the future. The prominent place will not guarantee you guests forever. It is simply not a coincidence that every time I went to the front desk there were other guests complaining about diverse things too.

We asked for a small fridge (we had 2 diabetics taking insulin in the room) - it took hours to get the fridge and when it finally arrived they tried to plug it in and said \"oh that's broken, we'll send up someone to fix it. meanwhile don't use the plug.\" The fridge still was never hooked up by the time we left (only stayed 2 nights) AND they tried to charge us for it. They said \"well, it was in your room.\" 3. Keys never worked. We had a group of about 30 staying at the hotel using 8 rooms. Reservations were made in January 2011 for the December 2011 trip. We did get a good rate HOWEVER, 7 of the rooms were ready when we arrived, one (ours) was not. We (4 of us) didn't complain since we were going out for a late lunch anyway. After lunch (about 4:30 at this point) arrived back at the hotel to get the keys. Room was ready & keys given. So far so good. We met up with the other 2 and got keys. We stopped back at the hotel before going to a show and found out our keys didn't work. Went down to the lobby got new keys (for all 4 of us). Kept the keys separate and all that. 2nd day - same thing keys didn't work. In 3 days we got 3 sets of keys! 4. Room wasn't very clean and the heater/ac unit made lots of strange (and loud) noises. Others in our party mentioned that: 1. one night someone tried to break into their room. 2. they had to move because the fitness room was right above their room and apparently the hotel was fixing something or the machines in the room were old that they said it sounded like someone with a jack trying to come through the ceiling. 3. lots of mold in the bathrooms Also, when we tried to talk to the manager about the problems we had (especially the key situation) it seemed that we were bothering him. I did mention that this was my 2nd and LAST stay at the Mildford and all he did was look bored and didn't say anything. I would rate customer service at the Milford at a big fat zero!", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFit the bill\u201d", "Author": "MarylandMomSS", "ReviewID": "UR122590995", "Content": "I was looking for an inexpensive, clean hotel in the theater district.

The Milford is in the process of being renovated, which I knew before I booked. I was here about 15 years ago, and I have to say the improvements are impressive! I stayed in one of the \"renovated\" rooms--and had a small, but beautifully situated room (#2248) on a corner of the building with two amazing windows. I had a view of the city one direction, and a magnificent vista over the river from the other! LOVED it! The room was spotlessly clean with a sleek modern feel, and although free of frills--some of which I missed--the beds were brand new, and very comfortable. The best part of the experience, however, was that everyone we encountered from the reception/check-in staff, to the bell captain/doorman (who was most charming!)--all went out of their way to be cheerful and helpful. Valet parking was a breeze. The breakfast (not automatically included), was half a block away, in a small linen-tablecloth bistro--and it was perfectly delicious, with great service. If I had any criticism, it would be that some of the basic creature comforts are missing--like a coffee maker in the room. (We found the Starbucks in the gift shop day two, which helped!). Our other mission was finding a roll of toilet paper--about 10 PM one night, and that proved impossible, short of getting dressed and trekking downstairs to the reception area. No answer at the concierge desk, no way to contact housekeeping that we could find, and even calling the desk downstairs took some doing. Advice to the hotel: Provide a little \"guide\" to services and perks in the room (like the Starbucks in the giftshop) so that guests can get comfortable faster. Bottom line: There are still some rough edges, but overall this is a great place to stay, right in the heart of the theatre district, right at Times Square, that doesn't cost a fortune.

The elevators were small and reasonably fast. The lobby reminded me of a boring old Soviet hotel, but the staff were cordial and helpful. I understand that the lobby will be spruced up as part of ongoing renovations (our room being an example of the renovations already completed). The entire hotel was a \"no-frills\" facility that completely met our needs.

Milford Plaza Hotel does. Why would they do that right at the time when people are checking out is baffling to me. After a few minutes of just standing in the hall we asked an employee (he did not understand or speak English at all- I am never against that person having a job, but still an employee should be able to instruct about where a stairway is in case of an emergency) if we can take the stairs down and where they are. He showed us to door after a while of explaining what we wanted to do, so we took the stairs down. We were on the 6th floor. The stairs ended on the 3rd, and the doors were blocked by construction. I guess if there was a fire or some other emergency, we might as well be dead by now. We went back upstairs to the elevators and waited some more for the safety check to end. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for safety, I don't want the elevator I'm in to fall down the shaft to a crushing death but why not do it at 3 am or some other time when there aren't so many people waiting for them? When we finally got downstairs there was a line of pissed off people checking out. There was one person at the desk at the time most people were trying to get out of that God-forsaken place. Our room was smaller than my bedroom at home and I rent a 1 bedroom apartment in Chicago, so that should say something about it. The bathroom was also smaller than the one I have at home, which is luxury compared to the one in the hotel. There was not even a chair in the room, because it would not fit anywhere. The beds were tiny and offered no support at all. The view out the window? Trash receptacles. What was probably the worst thing about it was that on the day we checked in there was no warm water neither in the sink, nor the shower. I'm not talking about hot, I'm talking warm. We washed in cold water is what I'm saying here. I don't know who gets the rooms, which were pictured in the Pictures section of the site I booked it on but I guess I'd have to shell out 10 times more than what I paid. If I haven't booked through Kayak but paid the full price for it, I'd just demand my money back for the experience. I guess that's how the Times Square area is hotel-wise because I will not say the same thing about the entire Manhattan. Just two stops north on the 1 subway we got a room at Upper West Side in a 4 star hotel for $30 less. Two queen beds, everything brand new, wood-paneled bathroom with a great shower. My advice to folks visiting Manhattan: never room anywhere in the Times Square area, unless you have the money to splurge on something at least 4 star.

Seven days before we were scheduled to arrive, our trip plans had to change. As a result, we cancelled that reservation. My husband and I decided to make the trip anyway, and due to the last minute change - budget was a serious determining factor secondary to location - so Milford Plaza was the best fit. While exploring hotels, I really was price driven when I encountered a \"12 Hour Sale\" through Milford's website and I was able to book a Queen Room, guaranteed to be renovated for $199/night on Friday & Saturday nights of Halloween Weekend. We arrived just after4pm and checked in almost immediately. Front desk wasn't friendly, but wasn't rude, so no problem there. We barely waited 10 seconds for an elevator and were quickly taken to the 5th floor. Room was renovated as promised. Small as I expected. No real surprises with that. Aside from the scaffolding, there was no other indication that renovations were taking place - we had incredible water pressure and plenty of hot water for our entire stay. My observations: Even after renovations are complete, Milford Plaza will never be a luxury hotel. At best, it will be a budget hotel that you will pay more for than other comparable hotels because of its location. Their attempt to renovate the entire hotel, top to bottom seems to have been a necessary step to continue to operate. However, I imagine the budget for these renovations was under compared to the reality that it may have become. It appears to me that the renovations have been done on the less expensive side and that they're reusing as much of the existing materials as possible. While I appreciate the attempt at this, much of the wood work wasn't stripped or sanded prior to painting and any wood work that was rotting or water damaged previously was simply painted and reused. If I were the management of Milford Plaza I would be upset with the work of the shotty contractors - paint dripped on the new carpet, globs of paint dripping down the walls that was never cleaned up, holes for the shower weren't aligned with the faucet, door knobs poorly reinstalled - just a few examples of what we saw in our room. Whether it was previous water damage or nicotine from a previously smoking room - when the ceiling and wood trim was covered in steam (from the shower) - yellow beads of water would trip from the white and gray paint. Also, none of the construction mess was cleaned out of the wall unit heater - every time it kicked on construction dust blew around and all the chunks of plaster knocked around on the inside. Other Issues: Housekeeping is clearly lacking at this hotel. First, the carpet in our room had only been vacuumed in the high traffic area around the desk and the bed. If you're going to have black carpet installed it needs to be thoroughly swept each and every time. Second, the bathroom trash wasn't emptied prior to our arrival - there were dirty Q-tips, dirt from sweeping the floor and Kleenex in the trash can. The partially used shampoo and conditioner provided by the hotel were left in the room for our use, rather than replaced. Finally, we had no wash clothes - not the end of the world, we used hand towels. My last issue with the hotel dealt with the bedding. I travel a lot for work and strip every bed before I sleep in it. There was no mattress pad on the bed! There was nothing between the mattress and the sheet we slept on, nor was there any extra bedding anywhere in the room. Not having something else between the mattress and the sheet I slept on, knowing how many people sleep on these mattresses every week - was a bit much for me. Whether this was an oversight by housekeeping or another way to cut corners at Milford Plaza is to be determined. Final thoughts: I felt like I got what I paid for at $199/night. Overall, the room was clean - nothing disgusting was found in the room. It has been freshly painted and low end furnishings were installed. It provided a clean, safe place for us to rest our heads in between activities. Given the price of $199/night - I would stay there again. However, I wouldn't pay more than $240/night - and even then I would shop around before I settled on $240/night. Had we paid the original price - I would have been extremely dissatisfied with my overall experience and the hotel.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kjtraveler2008", "Title": "\u201cWow what a disappointment!\u201d", "Author": "kjtraveler2008", "ReviewID": "UR119909342", "Content": "The Milford Plaza was a huge disappointment. We stayed here a few years ago and thought it was great. Nothing super fancy but the value in what we paid and what we got was certainly there. In coming back to the Milford with my husband this year and my parents we recommended that we all stay at the Milford again since it had been supposedly been upgraded and remodeled. What a disappointment. The remodel was only half complete and you could feel it throughout the whole hotel. I'm going to start with my parents room. They checked in to an inside room in which you have to literally turn yourself sideways to get around the bed. Literally the suitcases couldn't even fit on the floor anywhere except the desk at which the desk chair couldn't even fit at the desk it was so crammed. They had a bright red paint on one wall which I'm assuming was their remodel? The next day they asked to switch rooms and boy was it a nightmare. No accomodation to guests, it took two days. The 2nd room had the new flat screen TV and this old dusty wall heater. When they tried to turn it on it made some weird noise and the entire box fell off of the wall. Not only did they refuse to move my parents they sent an engineer up and no housekeeper to clean up all the dust and paint chips. The next day my husband went down and was so pissed to get my parents a third room and they were not only difficult but rude. The third room was fine but the most accomodation they gave my parents was a $100 off their 6 night stay which is nothing considering they had to move or attempted to everyday. Our room was fine. Again bright red paint, new TV and then the fire alarm looked gross and old. Every time we had been to the front desk people were complaining about mold, dirty towels, etc. Our room was also an \"upgraded room\". The lock on the bathroom door so you could lock someone in but not out. The duvet cover had some spots under it so I opened the duvet up and found huge clumps of dust. We didn't even bother complaining considering how awful the front desk had already been to my parents. When we got into our room late one night the maids had come but not refilled the toilet paper. When we called down to the front desk they said they would send someone up but they were busy and it could take a few hours--for toilet paper!!!!! Overall the only good thing was the location. They have loud club music in the lobby as an effort to make the hotel seem cool and trendy and they painted over everything old in the rooms. They are running out of money which is clear from their lack of customer service in resolving issues and even charge $3/bag for checking your luggage! We would never stay here again and would not recommend this place to anyone. It's sad that the upgraded rooms were worse than the ones we had when we came a few years ago.

The location is great if you have not been to NYC before and want to be central. However.... When we checked in, we asked which floor the gym was on (as advertised on the website) and was told the 3rd floor, and was told it is open 24 hours a day. Due to my jet lag, I went looking for the gym at 4.30am. I was surprised when I found the gym, with dismantled equipment, walls with large sections of plaster missing, and the strip lights in the middle of the floor. Needless to say, I did not get much exercising done. We made it to our room after a relatively long wait for lifts (they are on a strange automated system) and we were very disappointed with the room on the 12th floor. The carpet was stained, old and tatty, aong with missing bathroom tiles and a continuous running tap, we were not overally impressed. The heater did not work, instead blowing out cold air and the safe did not close. We got the safe fixed, and they did comoe up straight away. However we did not want to wait in all day for the engineer for the heating, so went without during our stay. At check in, it was made very obvious to us, that this was the only room available with triple status. The website also offered a good restaurant. We did not see any signs when we checked in, but when we checked with a very unhelpful receptionist, we were told in a very rude way that renovations were going on and of course the restaurant was closed. 7am each morning was the time the builders started banging! there was no let up even on Saturday! So we got used to getting up very early, which meant that we did not stay out late into the evening. I cannot decide whether the staff did not care, or were so embarressed by the situation that they tried to block it out. Toilets in the lobby were kept locked and the key kept at concierge. Not an issue, if the concierge were working 24 hours a day, but guess what........ We also asked about a local attraction taking place in October, an annual event for some years, but they had no information. I understand that refurbishment is necessary, however I am a strong believer that you need to be honest with your guests. No restaurant or gym were big issues for me, along with tatty rooms, noise at 7am and staff who were de-motivated and unwilling to help. My advice is to stay at the Intercontinental across the road or another reputable hotel and avoid the Milford Plaza. Also as 3 guests in a room, I would love to know how we were meant to share 1 bath towel! If you do have to stay here, don't pay for internet at $15 a day.

Not only were the halls dank, dark and smelly as it has been closed up for a year, the room was horrid. We tries to get another room we were even willing to pay an extra $50-100 per person but they were booked, if you can imagine! We called housekeeping to ask for 2 blankets, never saw or heard back from anyone, never received the blankets either. As to the bathroom, to say it was small was an understatement Small would have been bearable at least if it had been clean. The sink still had the 2 different taps for hot & cold, that dripped all night. The shower would have loved to meet some Clorox as the mold was all black around the faucet and tiles along the bottom of the wall where it meets the tub. The shower head periodically gave you hot and cold water with no rhyme or reason as to when you would get blasted with either one. The best was the wallpaper literally hanging off and then finally falling off the wall behind the toilet. Oh and last but not least were the rusted out bottoms of the door frame, which looked as though they would collapse at any time.... NASTY is a mild word in describing this snakepit! The room itself had 2 double beds, and I use the word beds loosely, they we more like sponges sitting on top of a box top. There were no covers on the bed except for the top sheet, which maybe that way as the \"BED BUG\" scare through out Manhattan, but not to worry, those bugs have moved on up and out of that neighborhood! We learned our lesson and will not be back at the MILFORD! I don't care if the \"THE DONALD\" takes that place and makes it over.

We had booked a renovated room, the room was immaculately clean and remained so throughout our stay, we had ample fresh towels ever day and the bedding was also changed every day as well as the whole room being cleaned throughout. The beds were very comfortable, all in all the housekeeping could not be faulted what so ever. The room was of average size, we stayed in a hotel in Paris where the room was smaller. The only evidence of the current refurbishment we witnessed was the scalffolding outside the entrance of the hotel, there was no excessive noise that we wtinessed. The lifts are excellent we were on the 26th floor you simply enter your floor number and the lift takes you straight there without stopping at any other floors. We felt very secure in this hotel on numerous occasions on entering the hotel, security asked to see our room card. On our last day we were not flying home until late evening and asked for a late checkout until 5pm, as this would allow us to another full day in NYC, this was no problem and the charge was minimal but well worth it. We found the main reception staff friendly. The only thing I could fault the hotel on is the in-room safe we could not get it to work, we had to ask a second time for someone to look at it and when they did they did not have the tools to fix it. They said they would return however we discovered the safe is not secured so if anyone did break into your room they could simply lift the safe and walk out. A note to hotel management secure the safe and ensure it is working. Another point to travellers we also had a hairdryer in the room, do not make the mistake I made and moaned about the short lead, I discovered on the last day the lead on the hairdryer was retracted!!! The location of this hotel is second to none, you are central to everything, I timed the walk to Time Square and it took 3 minutes, you are also in the centre of the theatre district and close to 42nd street main subway station. This was our first visit in New York and we wanted to spend money on bus tours and taking in all the tourist spots. The money we saved on staying at this hotel allowed us to do this, when you compared prices to other hotels in the area. My advise to anyone considering booking this hotel, book a renovated room, it cost us less than $100 (\u00a375) over a five night stay to upgrade to a queen renovated room.

(I have spent less and gotten a much better room but I'm sure room rates are dependent on the time of year as well and we were not looking to break the bank for a two day stay. I also know there are MANY worse places to have stayed for the four bills we spent. Our stay was during \"high season\". There is a glimpse of Deco left to it. The handrails in the lobby stairs and possibly the elevator cars themselves which seem to have been updated to a certain degree still have a hint of this hotel's possible glory days. We stayed in a 1 queen sized bed room. The air conditioning was just enough to call it air-conditioning. I'm pretty sure the rooms were last updated in the eighties. The carpeting tells the story on that. Don't expect to see much out your window because there is so much soot and mud on the outside. Not sure when the last time the windows were cleaned and I guess in NYC it's an expensive proposition to do so. They were single paned windows and probably the originals. Also, I would say the decor is dull at best. The bathrooms were a bit updated ( from 1920 ) as well, but again, this almost brings it up to satisfactory levels and not much further. They did have room safes so this is another amenity that made me feel like it was secure. The water pressure was OK and we were on the 12th floor. We were there at a busy time of year and maybe this is the only time they were at maximum capacity. I have to say the cleaning staff were friendly and sure to say \"Good Morning\" as you passed in the corridors. For the four bills we laid out for two days it was not a bad experience. The only cool thing about this hotel is the way you get access to use the elevator. My suspicion is that they sprang for a computerized system that designates what is the most efficient route to get you and any other guests up or down, fast. You use your card key (room key) and slide it through the card reader near the elevator area. It designates which elevator car will come to get you and sometimes we had a choice of two. Check in and check-out were both uneventful and fairly efficient. I rate this hotel at the bottom of satisfactory but it still falls into satisfactory and in addition, I would say it really isn't average either but not bad enough to rate it poor.

First, let me tell you that we made our reservations 6 months in advance and the room charge, including taxes, was an extremely reasonable $225.00/night. Friends who made reservations to New York 6 weeks ago are paying upwards of $500/night. We also were in New York for the 10th anniversary of 9/11. I believe the city was booked solid for the remembrance Keep that in mind as you read my review. I do not know if we are going to return or not. We first stayed at the Milford about six (6) years ago. It was a very enjoyable, but old New York City Hotel. It is very conveniently located to Times Square, theaters and Restaurant Row. For New York standards, the rooms are decent size. Several years ago, the hotel stated it was starting renovations. We were very excited. The rooms need a fair amount of TLC. The bed was clean (the spreads have been removed in favor of the duel sheet process so that there are always clean sheets acting as an envelope for the blanket. That keeps who-knows-when-it-was-last-cleaned bedspreads off me. The rooms are small. This is New York, and after all, real estate is a premium. There are no king size beds at this hotel. Our room on this last trip had a queen bed, straight back chair and 2 end tables and 2 lamps. The room, unfortunately, looked into a light shaft. I could not tell that any renovations were made or underway. The bellman assured us, there were in fact renovations. We did not get a renovated room. The front desk is a short escalator ride to the second floor. When we checked in (Friday night) there were only two people working at the front desk and corresponding line of people waiting to check in. The hotel does not appear to really be ADA compliant. Leaving the lobby, you must walk down a flight of stairs (with your luggage. Unacceptable to me.) The elevators are fantastic. Near the elevators is a keypad. Punch in your floor, and you are directed to a specific elevator car. You rarely, if every share a car with anyone. Once in the specified car, you are whisked right to your floor. In the past, there was a guard monitoring people who accessed the elevators. You had to show a key to gain access to the keypad, and subsequently your floor. That guard is gone and anyone can type in a floor number and gain access to the hotel. The bathrooms have had little to no attention in the past few years. There was a buildup of grime on the bathroom threshold. It was disgusting. I wore socks in the room except when showering. The blackout curtains were also dirty. Ugh. My husband thinks this is a great hotel, especially for the price. Of course I cannot complain about the price, but the grime, in my opinion, is unacceptable. As I stated earlier, I do not know if we will return or not. If renovations are being made, I will give the hotel another opportunity. The location is excellent. There is Wi-Fi available for $14.95/day and FREE Wi-Fi at the Starbucks 5 feet from the hotel front door. There was a complementary safe in our room. The bathroom comes with the usual hair dryer, soaps, shower cap, etc. There was a soda machine on our floor and ice nearby. In the lobby, there is a gift shop.

Hours later, when we still had nothing more than sheets on our beds, I called again. - Three attempts later, they finally sent up two very thin and scratchy blankets (one for each bed). I came to the conclusion that this hotel perhaps does not have comforters??? This was odd, but not the beginning of our woes. To reach the elevators, one must take a flight of steps. There are no elevators on the main floor. - Also, the rooms were filthy. The bathrooms had mildewy crumbling caulk on the tiled walls and there were lint balls in the corners every-where. The room smelled of damp mildew. We learned after two days, that if we left anything on the beds, room-service would not make the beds. The towels were extremely thin and scratchy.

However, it does not appear to be upgrading the look of the hotel, but perhaps making the hotel meet fire and building code. The first room we had on the 22nd floor was very small with a window unit hanging out of the window, right over the built-in AC unit that apparently no longer works. When asked if we wanted one bed or two, we thought they meant one king bed or two doubles -- when we said two beds, we got two twins. This isn't Europe, so two doubles is a pretty standard expectation for US hotels. The room and bathroom was very small, with not much space for luggage. It was literally the size of a typical cruise ship stateroom (only without the closet space). The bathroom had been cleaned very quickly, with a dark ball of toilet paper left under the back of the toilet and perhaps half a dozen long black hairs around the toilet, tub, and sink. Fixtures leaked and the room \"matched\" the rest of the hotel--generally run down. Wires were in conduits throughout the hotel, showing where the hotel had updated to add telephone/cable/fire, but didn't bother actually pulling it through the ceiling and drywall. It was apparent the hotel had tried to update its look, but it did so with some stick-on wallpaper and some thin carpet in the hallways that wasn't installed correctly, so it buckled up. There was constant hammering in another room that appeared to be directly behind our room. Since we had an early AM flight, we needed rest in the afternoon, so we asked the front desk for another room. We were put into another room on the 9th floor. This room didn't have a window unit, but the built-in AC was very loud and took several hours to cool the 12x12 foot room. The bathroom was a little cleaner, but hair was still around. The beds in both rooms were very \"well used\" and on shaky foundations whereby if you sit on the edge, the mattress would flip upward. This may not be the case in rooms with a larger bed, but as stated earlier, we anticipated having two double beds, not two singles when we request a room with \"two beds\" (as they were careful not to indicate that \"two beds\" means \"two twin beds\").

We were fortunate that it didn't get too hot in our room despite this. The walls need to be painted. Because of cost, location, and other positives, I wouldn't rule out staying here. However, be warned that the rooms are no place to do anything other than sleep. What is sad about this hotel is that if the rooms were upgraded it would be a real great place to stay.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot impressed.... at all\u201d", "Author": "SuseteP", "ReviewID": "UR116223202", "Content": "Just got back from New York and stayed at the Milford Plaza and must say my overall experience was not what I expected. We booked a 4 night stay and unfortunately, our flight on the Firiday night was cancelled and we were unable to get into the city until the next day. When I received notification that our flight was cancelled, I immediately emailed the reservations desk at the hotel advising them that we were not going to make it that night and if they could cancel. To this day, I have not heard back from them. It made me worry all night thinking they would assume a \"no show\" and cancel our reservation all together and we wouldn't have a place to stay. Once we arrived, we went to the luggage assistance desk. They took our bags and gently asked for a tip, which we gave. We went up to the front desk to check in. I explained to the representative about our flight cancellation and asked if they could waive that night's fee. There was nothing they could do for us. We were stuck paying the bill for that one night. Even a discounted price would be a nice gesture. Once we were checked in, we went back down to get our luggage and the gentleman asked for our room number and said he would bring them up. We waited a good 15 minutes before getting our luggage which made me worry a bit and also made us anxious as we wanted to get our vacation started considering it was cut short by 1 day. I honestly would rather bring my own luggage up to my room. They dropped off the bags and the same person then asked for a tip at the door AGAIN. Really? We had just given him a tip when we dropped off our luggage with him in the lobby before checking in. First impresstion: The room was SUPER tiny which I am okay with if it looked and smelled decent. There was an old musty, moldy smell in the room, the washroom was not pretty either. I can deal with small as long as it's clean. The faucet had rings of rust and the water pressure was pathetic. The bath tub was gross. I wore flip flops when showering. The bed sheets were clean but had tears on them. the outlets didn't work properly and one of them by the T.V. didn't even have a plate over the outlets (a bit dangerous). The T.V. looked like it was donated by Goodwill and the cable was static. I mean it when I say it, I do not have high expectations and not picky but I was extremely disappointed with this hotel and would not stay here again or recommend it to anyone. It just felt so dirty and old. The only good thing about this place is the location. Good thing we only needed the place to sleep and freshen up.

The TV was ancient and the mirrors along the wall were smudged and clearly dated. I felt like the room was very unsanitary and I left 30 minutes after stepping foot into the hotel.

Overall, the whole hotel is average. Don't except too much. The hotel is undergoing renovations but you can only get a renovated room if you paid full price(about $300) which we did not. We paid $135 for 4 people which was well worth it compared to the high prices in Manhattan. Once they are fully renovated then anyone can have a renovated room. The location was great. We were right near time square and even saw the fourth of July fireworks from our room. We were on the 12th floor and able to get a city view room. When we arrived, the front desk staff nice except for one lady who was very rude with us and we weren't even speaking to her. Our hotel room was average. It was a dated room with two double beds with clean white sheets and no comforter. The room had a small tv and a tiny bathroom. The hallways had an older scent but not a strong scent that bothers you. We were fine with this because we were barely in the room. If three star is what you want, then three star is what you'll get.

Wallpaper peeling everywhere. 3. Furniture old, dated, and very worn out. This is stuff I'd expect to see at a tag sale or goodwill. 4. Carpet, hallways, worn and dated. 5. Lobby entrance very oddly laid out. 6. Nonexistent security. 7. Indifferent, weary staff. I expressed my dissatisfaction to several of them. They all apologized, but really couldnt offer any solution. One flat out told me that the hotel was not the nicest one around and that they wouldn't recommend it to their friends or family. That should tell you all you need to know! 8. WiFi is an additional $14.95 per day and the quality is poor at best. I tethered my laptop to my cell and the Internet connection speed was significantly faster. In NYC, in this day and age, this is an expected amenity for a business traveler, not a luxury. Extremely poor. 9. Tv is a 19\" Zenith circa 1980??? WAY out of date. 10. AC unit could barely keep the room cool 11. Bathroom very dated and not clean. In defense of the cleaning staff, it seems as if they try, but like any older porcelain fixtures, these have reached a point where they can no longer be effectively cleaned. Grout lines in the tile are dirty, etc. It looks as if a renovation was tried at one point perhaps, but it was a half hearted job at best. 12. Paint work is terrible. Door trim has been recently painted perhaps, but they didn't bother to prep any of the surfaces. New paint was simply applied over old layers of peeling paint. 13. Only 3 outlets in the room. All behind furniture and low to the floor. 14. Convenience/gift shop in lobby closed at odd times with a be back later sign in the window. I know, I'm in NYC, I could get anything I wanted on the corner. However, sometimes I just want to get a diet coke or cup of coffee without going out in the rain. Also, the clerk couldn't take any cards because the cc printer was out of paper and there were no spares rolls in the store. This condition has been going on for two days. 15. Coffee. Really? No complimentary coffee? Anywhere? Makes me wonder if the management of this hotel has ever stayed in another hotel ever before? I'm sure there is something that I missed, but that should paint a good picture for you. Sorry to be so negative, but this is one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had. I travel for a living.

However, in my room I found: - no clock radio - no ironing board - no bedspread, only one thin blanket covered by a sheet - no washcloths - a moldy smell - a tiny red lace thong, on the floor at the foot of the bed I called, and Housekeeping brought me the radio, two washcloths, two blankets -- and the small fridge I'd asked for. No place to put the fridge except on the dresser that also held the TV. No desk or chair, just a small armoire and night stands. I was planning to ask for a better room the next day, but I discovered that this one was quiet and the shower worked very well, so I decided to stay put. There ensued a struggle over washcloths -- the used and unused ones both disappeared the next day, not to be replaced for two days, despite requests. When I did get one, I hid it in the armoire each day, and this took care of the problem. The moldy smell came and went. I bought some flowers, which helped. To the good: at very few hotels will the housekeeping staff actually let you alone when the Do Not Disturb sign is up, waiting until midday to clean your room. I appreciate that. The wi-fi worked well, no problems with the ancient TV. When I needed help printing out theater tickets, the desk staff did this for me without charge. The location can't be beat, if the reason you're in NY is to go to the theater. Also close to all subways, so Museum Mile is not far, nor is the Village, etc. To find places to eat, I suggest going to Open Table, asking for Theater District or Hell's Kitchen, choosing your price range, and taking it from there. Would I go back to the MP? Yes, but only with a renovated room. And I hope they bring back their Club Level, or whatever they called it. I loved having the lounge and snacks around. They do need more staff available, esp at night; to schedule a wake-up call, I had to go down to the front desk as that button on the phone didn't work -- nor did several others.

It was quite busy in reception so maybe this is why they hurried to check us in and give us a key - no mention of where our room or the lifts were located or how to use the unique lift system (meaning that we went up and down twice before getting to our floor). The room was an OK size with 2 double beds which were fairly comfy, however, within 5 minutes I had scraped my leg on one of four metal bars which were sticking out the side of my bed! Surely that is unsafe and would not be allowed in the UK! A child could easily injure themselves badly. I just had a bruise! Other issues we faced included no batteries in the TV remote control! Shower worked on and off. Safe would also not work. No additional bedding was available and we found the thin duvet quite cold in the night. Generally, the room was very old and felt quite dirty with mould in various places. The corridors and public areas were pretty much the same and in serious need for renovation.

I was not informed of this policy when I made the reservation. Anyhow, went up to the room on the 18th floor, first impressions was that this hotel is stuck in the early 1980s. Furnishing very dated, especially the bathroom. Also, there seems to be a problem with the bath tub hot water tap. It heats up within seconds, and I found it very dangerous to touch especially when turning off the water tap after a shower. There was also hot water leaking from the tap while it is in use. The bath room also looked like it needed a good scrub. TV was fuzzy and only had a few TV channels. The only good thing going for this hotel was there the housekeeping staff does a great job, the rooms are always clean, and the bed sheets had no bedbugs. However, I can\u2019t say the same for the porter service. When I was ready to check out, I called the front desk for luggage assistance, but after ten minutes nobody came. So, in the end, I just rolled my luggage to the lobby level by myself. Quite troublesome, as I had three large suitcases. (I was travelling with one other person) The in-room Internet access charges were about US15 per day but as I did not expect to be in the room for most of the day I decided go without internet access. However, this hotel also has desktop computers with internet access going at a rate of $0.25 a minute, minimum $5 in the hotel lobby. I did use this to check my emails every other day. While doing my research for this hotel, I found out that they plan to rent out their renovated rooms in Jun 2011. However, when I checked out of this hotel in the first week of May 2011, it looked as though no renovation work had been done. Personally, I would not stay at this hotel again even though the rates are comparatively cheaper then other hotels in the area. Also, based on the fact that this hotel charged my credit card for the entire stay upon check-in, without prior warning and that this hotel is just sooooo old. One final note, if you do decide to stay in this hotel, avoid making calls using the room\u2019s telephone. I made 3 local calls, each lasting no more than 60 seconds, and was charged US$3.75 when I checked out. This may be the standard rate of all NY hotels.

Actually, this hotel wasn't, but the Hotel Thirty Thirty was. We arrived in New York and went to the Hotel Thirty Thirty in order to check-in. When we got there, everything seemed normal through the first couple of questions until the reception agent told us that due to renovations they didn't have a room for us. As a result, they'd be giving us a letter to another hotel for us to go to for accommodations. That hotel was the Milford Plaza. The Thirty Thirty gave us $10 for a cab but we pocketed the cash and walked the several blocks to the new hotel. Upon arrival, the staff were friendly and amiable. It took a few minutes to get our reservation made up, during which the staff chatted us up. We were promised \"the best room they had\", but I think that's just a standard line. The Room: \"Cozy\" would be the best euphemism to describe this room. \"European\" would be another. It was perfectly apportioned to hold the TV and stand, bedside table, armoire and double bed. A larger bed would have made the room unworkable. Also, the \"best room\" didn't really have much of a view, though a look out to the side showed the buildings around Times Square. I had heard that the hotel was undergoing renovations and, based on what I could see in other rooms, it was clear that this was the case. Ours, however, had not been redone. The bathroom, vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the room was small but decent. A full-sized tub and shower, along with sink, toilet and radiator, as well as a window were fit nicely in there. Amenities: A kind of strange twist to the atmosphere was the techno music piped into the lobby. I believe the eventual goal with the reno is to have a more trendy hotel and bar (that had yet to open). The elevators were kinda cool with the new system whereby you press your desired floor and it tells you which elevator to go to. Kinda takes the guesswork out as to which one will open when there are 8 elevators. Also, it means that rarely are you on an elevator with anyone else. There were two computers near the reception desk with internet access for a fee (25\u00a2/min with a $5 minimum), however the ability to use the computers to check-in for your flight online was provided for free. Location: At 8th Ave and W 44th St. Extremely close to Times Square (though, unless you love crowds, I'm not sure why you'd go there). A subway stop is literally across the street serving the A, C and E lines and several others are only a block away. The PA Bus Terminal is two blocks south and Penn Station/MSG is about 10 blocks to the south, with Amtrak and NJ Transit connections to Newark Airport. As for anything else, you're in Manhattan. Anything you want is nearby. Summary: We got the Thirty Thirty for a pretty good rate (around $200) for the night. That looked to have been a nicer room so I wouldn't pay that much to stay at the Milford, at least in the room we got. But, it is Manhattan and anywhere is going to be somewhat pricey. A small room and a springy bed and only one pillow each left me with a desire for a bit more than what we got. However, if your purpose is to spend as little time in the room as possible, it's probably a decent value.

It's right around the corner from the heart of Times Square, only a few blocks from Madison Square Garden/Penn Station, which was great because we came in on the train from Philly, and it was only a 10 minute walk from our destination (Terminal 5). However, from the moment I checked in, nearly every moment I spent in the hotel was awful. Check in was quick, but then I got to the room. I had read these rooms were small, but I had no idea what i was in for. Barely room to walk. The clock had not been adjusted to account for daylight savings time, which had switched almost a month prior. The beds and pillows were extremely uncomfortable. Not only did I get a terrible night of sleep because of the beds, but at about 7 am, workers resumed the loud, unrelenting renovation work they were doing down the hall. I woke up to take a shower after I finally couldn't take the noise anymore, and the water pressure was like a fire hose. I never thought I'd ever complain about a hotel shower having TOO much water pressure. I was wrong. The second night wasn't much better, although the renovation work didn't start till 9 the next morning. However, a member of the cleaning crew came into our room at 7:30 without knocking to clean, and when she saw we were still in bed, just shut the door without saying a word. I have had bigger, nicer rooms with more comfortable beds and better service at Super 8 motels.

One person's four-star experience is not the same as another's. That's because one rates one's experience not against some generic rubric, but against one's own expectations. This hotel earns four stars from us not because it was anything spectacular, but because it met our expectations: Here's what we were expecting and what we got: - it is right in the theater district and one block from a show we were seeing, so the location was right for us - the price was very reasonable: we received the 30% rate which is part of the grand reopening promo, which meant we got two rooms with two double beds for around $200, including taxes. Hard to beat. - The rooms were just fine. The sheets were clean and cozy white cotton, the mattresses and pillows perfectly nice. The temperature was fine, the shower was hot, and there was no visable grime/mildew, etc - we had a pretty few of the city, not of an air shaft (which I have sometimes had at a much higher price) BUT the hotel rooms are old and tired and would do well to be renovated, which I guess is underway: our rooms were certainly not yet renovated. The wood trim around the bathroom doors has been painted a million times, and the heater rattled somewhat. The walls must be fairly thin so we could hear our next-door neighbors very faintly (luckily, they were our family). The hotel does not have a restuarant, room service, a pool or a ... well I guess anyting else. Ther are no coffee pots, but we didn't care because we left at 5am. A note about the service: everyone was perfectly polite and pleasant to deal with. We did not test the problem-solving abilities of the staff because we didn't bring anything to their attention.
