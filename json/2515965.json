The room we had was big enough, with a \"high\" and very soft bed and a little but comfortable sitting space. Everything was very clean in despite of the fact that the floor was carpeted.

Our flight arrived very early and we arrived at the hotel by about 10am. We didn't expect that we'd be able to check in, so we were prepared to just hang out around the area until we could check in and get settled. When we arrived, check in was very fast and easy even though our room wasn't ready. They kept our luggage for us and the concierge showed us downstairs to the breakfast/common area and told us to help ourselves to breakfast if we'd like. This was awesome, as we hadn't eaten and were pretty exhausted. The downstairs is very cozy, with a fireplace and little nooks and crannies to sit in and explore. There is a sweet little courtyard, that I'm sure is lovely on a sunny day. Our room was ready about an hour later and our luggage had already been delivered to the room, which was nice. The room was very large with a king sized bed, a pull out sofa bed, a gas fireplace, a wingback chair, large closet and a cute, little kitchen nook with a bar sink, microwave, some glassware, and a refrigerator (stocked with complimentary water and soda! Daily!). The room was bright and looked out on trees on the back of the property, which was lovely. The location of this hotel is fantastic!!! We walked everywhere......Chinatown is very close, as is the cable car museum and the cable car line. It was a really nice, leisurely walk all the way to the waterfront and you can take the cablecar back up! The neighborhood felt safe and there are lots of little markets closeby to buy any drinks or snacks you might want. The service at this hotel is perfection. They know you by name, they are helpful without being overbearing. Every day, the manager would check in with us to see how we were and if we needed anything or had any questions. They have maps, coupons, restaurant suggestions, everything you could need at the front desk. We found in and out parking about 3 blocks away at the State Garage. It was fairly reasonable by SF standards at about $18 a day. We just parked when we arrived and didn't really use the car until we checked out. Breakfast was delicious. It changed every day...one day quiche, the next waffles, the next eggs and bacon. Everything was very good. We never left hungry and the coffee was always there....any time of day. The nightly happy hour is FANTASTIC! There area always a few wines to choose from...cheeses, crackers, fruit, dolmas, olives, little tarts......we actually had a late dinner because we were full from the happy hour! It's all about the little touches at the White Swan. The fresh, warm cookies in the lobby in the afternoons, the teddy bear for the daughter, the personal service. This hotel is fabulous and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cozy, convenient place to stay in SF. We loved it and will definitely be back!

It's got the whole English B&B motif. The staff is exceptionally friendly and answered all of my questions. They even reserved a taxi to take me to the airport at 5am. The elevator is very old fashioned, but it's cool. Plenty of places nearby to eat and various MUNI bus stops in the area plus street cars. If you prefer to walk, be warned, the hotel is on a rather hilly street. You need a key to open the front door of the hotel. Not something I see often, but it keeps out the wrong crowd so I consider that a plus. Even though it's close to the hustle and bustle of Union Square, the White Swan sits on a rather quiet street, so noise wasn't a factor. There are only a couple of cons which is why I gave it 4 stars. It was rather hot in SF most of the time I was there, but the rooms don't have A/C. Thankfully, there was a fan in the closet, which saved me!! Also, while the hotel offers free Wi-Fi, the connection isn't the greatest. So if you're a business traveler or need the internet to plan out your SF adventures, consider yourself warned. It can be a little frustrating to surf the web.

I had quiche, yogurt, oatmeal, and fruit, but there were also pastries, hard-boiled eggs, cereal, and more. The staff was friendly and helpful. Here are a few nitpicks - you decide if any are important to you. 1. The building is old, e.g., you open and close the accordion door of the ancient elevator yourself (I thought it was fun, but it doesn't make for quick trips to the room). 2. The rug in my room was not a sparkling hotel commercial carpet, but it fit the feel of the place. 3. The coffee both in-room and at breakfast is Folgers-ey. 4.

It was a great location in the city along Bush St where it is a little quieter instead of being on Powell St itself. The hotel is a beauty... not your typical decor. The fireplace in the room was definitely a draw for me. The dining room in the basement served simple and lovely breakfast (nothing huge like the typical American breakfast) but sufficient to fuel yourself in the morning. I didnt get to enjoy the evening wine and snacks served but my co-worker did and she said it was lovely, especially the ambience. The only hiccups I had were with the wifi - signal was not very strong and whenever I was on \"facetime\" (apple mobile app), the line would drop off which proved to be disruptive in the conversation. The other was the television - somehow I had only 1 channel and I had to ask the front desk twice to have someone come fix it. Wasnt a big deal since that 1 single channel had great movies for the day.

The service we received from the staff was great. The maid service was especially good - when we put the do not disturb sign up, the maid left a bag of fresh towels on our door handle for us. Very nice! The breakfast has a fairly good selection and the hot food would vary from day to day. Breakfast is served in this downstairs lounge - they had it all decorated for Christmas! It has a fireplace sitting area, some couches, lots of room and is a great place to sit and chat. They also serve wine and snacks from 4-7pm, which was a nice touch and helped my husband and I relax after a day out walking. The room itself was was really cute and having a fire place was great and romantic! And everything was clean and well taken care of. Being a Joie de Vivre property, you can sign up for their loyalty card for free - which my husband and I did - which meant we got a little bottle of wine, some chocolates and free teddy bear upon arrival. This is without having stayed at one of their properties before, so you don't have to have any points to start getting the benefits! They have a valet parking service, which we used once when we rented a car - it was quick and I think the price was on par with what you'd have to pay elsewhere in the city. The only small issue I had with the hotel was that whatever cleaner they used left a smell behind, which made the place smell kinda like a hospital. We got used to it after a bit but both of us having mothers who are very sensitive to smells, I just wanted to point that out because if you are sensitive to that kind of thing, it could be a problem. But really, that's a very minor thing and everything else was fantastic. The location is close to Union Square, however, it is up a fairly steep hill - which you may be able to manage quite well normally, but with 30-40 pounds of luggage, we found it quite a challenge.

There were lovely teddy bears in the lobby too but I was a tad disappointed not to have one in our room! Our bed was only a double which was mildly disappointing and our neighbours were noisy, waking us up several times during the night. Not the fault of the hotel though.

Their solution was to put us in another room which was actually dirtier. We suggested that they remove the curtains, which they did, except for one panel which was left. They cleaned them(?) and replaced them the next day. When we complained about the dirty bathtub they sent housekeeping to clean it. The hotel is old and charming but it is in dire need of major cleaning. I would also suggest that they switch to shower gel instead of soap to cut down on the scum in the bathroom and provide proper cleaning products to housekeeping.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to the San Francisco bay area. My only criticism of the hotel is that they need to freshen up the entrance lobby and the fire escapes on Bush Street. The lobby needs a facelift. Of course, it is a busy place so it sees more wear and tear, however, when entering a building it is the first impression that a traveler has. I will be honest, when I first entered, I was a little concerned as the settee and oriental rug appeared worn. I also had noticed that the paint was peeling off of the fire escape. There was some paint missing on banisters as well. These are small cosmetic fixes which I am sure the owner will tend to.

Wine was local and good and not limited, and some yummy treats which vary from day to day.

Most of the reviews were awesome and it sounded like a great place to unwind after running around all day. I must say that my stay was what expected and more. The accommodations were like staying someone else's home, not perfect but just quirky. The room was comfortable and clean, a working fireplace that we even got the chance to use in July. Although the bathroom took a little getting use to (large old tub). The decorations was sweet and just so welcoming to sit and talk to other people. The couple of times I got to evening tea were memorable, meet some great people. The breakfast was awesome usually my best meal of the day. (Cooked meals everyday) One morning I went down early to make myself some time tea and the staff hadn't had a chance to prepare anything. The lady on duty was so nice to drop what she was doing just to boil me so water. This hotel is within walking distance of shopping, dining, Chinatown and the streetcars so we got around pretty easy. Like I said I was I could say it was perfect. I called a couple weeks before arriving to request a early check-in. The operator said that she couldn't promise anything and that was fair but I had also requested a room away for the busy street (good point to remember since you are downtown). When I arrive the front desk said that my room wasn't ready. No problem. But, the room they place us in was not only on the street but all the way on the top floor. So with the hotel's antiquated elevator (we never used to whole time we were there) this was not going to be acceptable. So after waiting a little (went to have lunch somewhere) we were place in a room on the back on the second floor where we were comfortable. I specifically told the front desk at that time that my mother would be checking in the following day so she wouldn't have a hard time. But, that is exactly what happened, she was given a hard time and was told that she could not check in. The last thing that really just left me with not so a great impression. Again the employee who check me in that first day, charged my card for $1000 for incidentals. When I asked about this, the young man that was on duty that day even thought that this was a ridiculous amount and doesn't know what that man was smoking that day. It took me a couple of visits to the front desk to straighten it out. Everyone else was so nice and professional, I don't know what was this guy's problem.

It was lovely to be able to look forward to coming back to the hotel rather than just treating it as somewhere to sleep. Breakfast was excellent (and, even better, included in the price). I was slightly apprehensive about going down to the evening wine & nibbles, as I was travelling alone, but there was no need to be. There is plenty space to sit on your own (and nod off, due to jet lag, in my case), or join with others if you feel like it - the sitting room area has lots of nooks and crannies, so it's all very relaxed, and the \"nibbles\" are far more substantial than I had expected. In fact I found I didn't need to go out for dinner afterwards, as I had had a reasonable-sized lunch and, having just arrived in the States, my bodyclock was out of synch anyway. Breakfast and the wine reception both had different offerings on different days. My bedroom was huge, with a good sitting area, and was very clean. The decor seemed a tiny bit tired in the daylight, but the room was lovely and cosy in the evenings with the living-flame gas fire on. There is a coffee maker in the bedroom, plus complimentary soft drinks (Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite, bottled water) in the in-room fridge. Complimentary coffee and a wide range of teas is available in the sitting room day and night (with both china cups/mugs and to-go paper cups with lids, which was super-handy), and there is a jar of complimentary cookies in the entrance hall. There is a turndown service (I imagine that's why another reviewer's teddy bear wasn't on the bed when he got back...), so fresh towels are available in the evening if you need them.

In most late afternoons we met for wine and hors d'oeuvres, and on a few late nights coffee/tea & cookies. Everything was provided by the hotel, free of charge. The large lower level is a natural setting for relaxing with family and, if you wish, interacting with other guests. We had fun chatting with couples from the UK and across the USA. The other families stayed in rooms off the street, but we requested ours to overlook Bush because we like the sounds of the city. The rooms are clean, spacious & comfortable. The bottled water & soda in the mini-fridge are free. All of the staff was wonderful, especially Ana who helped us make the arrangements for our stay and was at the front desk for much of the time, and Andy who looked after our needs on the lower level. Except for the spacious rooms, the White Swan has the look & feel of a charming European Hotel. The location is ideal: two blocks off California Street and the cable car to the Ferry Building, seven blocks from the Powell-Market hub, and with many reasonably priced good restaurants nearby. This part of Bush sees light pedestrian traffic and moderate street traffic. Cabs were easy to flag on the day of the wedding.

This we found was the standard of customer service in the White Swan, the front desk never spoke to you coming in or going out and they never offered to help with the cases up or down the steep steps to the road. Breakfast was very limited, if you came down at the wrong time the food had not been replenished the selection was not good. Our room was large and the furnishings well warn and tattered with peeling paint. The windows did not all open and one rattled when the wind blew until we put some card in it. The bed was creaky and soft.

On the other hand, the hotel is close to anything you care to mention, although again - not uncommon in San Francisco as it's a small place.

We were delighted by the lovely decor, warm fires roaring throughout the hotel and in our room, as well as the warm reception from the front desk staff. We brought our car, along, but we had a great experience with the valet service...getting our car was quick and easy to use. Our room was immaculate and well appointed with many special touches that you don't find in a regular hotel, including darling teddy bears on the large comfortable bed. We had the best time at the complimentary breakfast the next morning. The selection of freshly baked pastries, fresh fruit, and egg dishes were delicious and beautifully displayed. We were very impressed with the quality, quantity, variety, and presentation of all of the food. By the way, the coffee was execellent..as well as a great variety of lovely teas and hot chocoloates. The breakfast was served in a warm dining area, with french doors opening up to quaint garden courtyard. Right below the dining area is a welcoming large sitting area and also french doors into a darling library and sitting area where a warm fire was burning. The great part of staying at the hotel was that it is within walking distance of Union Square and Nob Hill. My husband and I were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go, without having to use our car or hire a taxi.

You can make arrangements to have dinner and lunch there for shabbat. A few blocks away at the entrance to Chinatown near the arch there is a kosher restaurant, Sabra, which serves good middle eastern food.

Having the cable stop to take you back to the hotel is a very nice bonus. We bought the 3 day Muni pass while waiting for our luggage at the airport and with that pass had unlimited use of the cable cars, the trains and the buses. It was a great, easy way to get around the City. We especially appreciated the JDV \"Greeter\" program. Jonathan showed us around the Haight/Ashbury area as well as Noe Valley.

I arrived by BART at approximately 2100 and walked the short distance to the hotel (about 10 minutes). The clerk was very helpful and welcoming upon check-in. The lobby was very warm and inviting; a fireplace crackled with a fire and a jar of cookies was tempting. I was given the keys to Room 31 and made my way to the second floor. I was so pleased to find the room was large, warm, and inviting. Romantic would be a good way to describe it, had I been there with my spouse. The bed was very large and comfortable with many various pillows to choose from. The fireplace created an inviting ambiance, and the books, wallpaper, and antique furnishings made it very comforting. The breakfasts were very European in distinction, with small pastries, frittatas, cereals, and fruit. The coffee was excellent! The evening wine and appetizers were delicious, elegantly displayed, and thoroghly satisfying. It was a pleasant experience to visit with other guests at the hotel. The hotel is located on Bush street, and is within walking distance to all things San Francisco. The only dollars spent for transportation were on the BART to and from the airport. It was 10 minutes walking distance to shopping and Chinatown and 30 minutes to Pier 39. There are numerous restaurants in the area. I was very impressed with the friendliness of the people in San Francisco. It seems to be a city centered on the arts and its people.

We were in California to celebrate my mom's 70th birthday. We spent 4 nights/5 days at the White Swan Inn at the beginning of our trip. The White Swan Inn was a great choice. It was a great small hotel in a big city in a good location. We had a room on the 1st floor with not much of a view other than a giant tree & a building behind us. But, it worked out fine for my mom who does not navigate stairs very well. There is an antiquated elevator that works perfectly fine for those that may be interested or need it. The hotel is older of course but very clean and tidy. Our room was spacious enough to accomodate the three of us with a king bed and a pull out sofa. At the beginning of our stay it was a bit chilly. The middle through the end of our stay the San Francisco weather was beautiful & warm. On warmer days, it did get a bit stuffy in the room in the evening and overnight. We did open the windows (our room had no screens) and this did help with the ventilation. On chilly mornings/evenings, the gas fireplace and heater in the room worked very well. The room, the bathroom, and the rest of the hotel are all very clean. As I mentioned before, a bit older but clean. The breakfast in the morning was good and of course very convenient. This made timing in the morning much easier so we didn't have to find breakfast every morning. Breakfast we certainly adequate with normally 2 hot items (quiche and scrambled eggs), hard boiled eggs, some type of protein (normally sausage), fresh fruit, bread, croissants, warm oatmeal, cold cereals, 2 juices, coffee, tea, etc. It was plenty to start off your busy day of touring San Francisco and the surrounding areas. Evening wine & cheese was also very nice with one type of red and white wine being offered along with a few hors o'dourves (normally some type of veggie & dip, brushetta on crackers, cheese & crackers, small meatballs, etc.). There were typically 3 items served each evening (at least on the evenings we made it). On my mom's 70th birthday we were in Napa all day. When we returned around 7pm there was a birthday cake in the room waiting for her - courtesy of the White Swan. I thought that was very nice. Our travel agent mentioned the birthday when making the reservation. The front desk staff at the White Swan Inn were always friendly and helpful. Kevin was exceptionally nice and very helpful. Another gentleman, Andy I believe his name may have been, who brought us to our room and also seemed to prep the area for the wine reception was also very nice. We appreciated the cleanliness and neatness of the hotel as well as the morning breakfast and evening wine and cheese. I would recommend the White Swan Inn to anyone staying in San Francisco and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. would want to know about the pull out sofa condition since it certainly seems that everything is well maintained at the White Swan.

First, the staff is very welcoming and knowledgeable about the area. They provide you with a list of outstanding local restaurants and were exceptionally helpful with tourists sites. The SF City tour they recommended was incredible. The hotel is also totally convenient to downtown SF. It is about one block to a cable car & then two blocks downhill to Union Square. It is one block uphill to the Mark Anthony Hotel and Grace Cathedral. The room we had was great. We splurged on a Deluxe King bed room. It was spacious, had windows overlooking a side greenery area, was beautifully decorated in red/green plaid bedding with floral wallpaper. The most unexpected but wonderful discovery was the hotel's original, and in perfect working condition, old type elevator with its pull back metal screen door (think the movie Charades). The food was fabulous, starting with a hot breakfast that changed daily. I loved the french breadpudding. Breakfast, included in your roomrate, had a variety of eggs, quiche, sausage, fresh fruit, toast, pastries, and hot gourmet oatmeal. The breakfast room is full of antiques. In the early evening, wine was served with a variety of cheese, crackers, fruit, fresh vegies, and a dessert. In the late evening coming in after a cold walk in the rain, we welcomed the hot cider and again fresh homemade cookies. The hotel was one of the great highlites of our trip.

Small grocery across street & a small sandwich shop that probably closed around 9 p.m. Downstair sitting & dining areas are very pleasant & lots of old world charm. Cons. The fifth floor room appeared to need some TLC. The faucet in the wet bar leaked & could not get it to turn off. My husband had to shut off the water, water dripped from cold water faucet in bathroom, repeatedly asked for extra towels that never arrived for we had 3 persons in room, & 19 inch color tv (cable hookup with lots of channels) with sound that was very low & barely could be heard with street noises. There probably are governors on the sound so occupants cannot turn on tv too loudly. This is not a problem unless you want to really listen to tv intensely, but who would --this is San Francisco!!! The elevator left much to be desired. It had its own charm, but if a person left the gate open, then the elevator would not operate. This was tough trying to haul baggage to main floor when leaving hotel. There is no way to let front desk know about this problem unless you go back to your room or someone ventures down the stairs.

So much more than we had expected. Our room faced the street, and yes there is street noise. But, no much more than one would expect in any large city. True, there is no air conditioning, in fact very few hotels in the city do have a/c. But with the mild climate of San Francisco, it is almost never needed. Parking is off site, so there is a bit of a wait for your car to be brought around if you need it immediately. But, with a little planning ahead, its a non-issue. We decided to do some shopping the day of our departure and the hotel stored our luggage for us until we returned. We called ahead for our car and it was waiting for us when we returned.

Quality Control and Attention to Detail Needed.\u201d", "Author": "Vermonter_7", "ReviewID": "UR8466579", "Content": "The White Swan Inn is a very nice property located in a very convenient location--BUT(!!)--they need to do some self-inspection and quality control before they lose all of the stars and diamonds which, I assume, they've worked to earn over a long period of time. My wife and I stayed at the White Swan during a recent conference I was required to attend. We stayed 2 nights. The front desk staff welcomed us nicely although beware--there really are no bellmen to speak of. The only person on duty is the person sitting at the front desk and as such, you will be required to carry your luggage up the front stairs and into the lobby. Very nice guys at the front desk and they probably would have assisted with the luggage if asked...but should one have to ask at a place with a lot of diamonds and stars? Because of the good reviews on Trip Advisor and in publications that award diamonds and stars, we decided to stay in the property's only suite accomodation: The Ashleigh Suite. It was nice but, again, beware--there are certain things you should know. The living room part of the suite faces the front of the hotel, directly on Bush Street...and at ground level. It's a tad bit noisy but not too bad--if you don't mind some street noise. The hotel is not air-conditioned which would not necessarily be a bad thing given that San Francisco is usually pretty cool, temperature-wise and you can open the windows. HOWEVER--in the living room portion of the Ashleigh Suite, the windows do not open. They have been closed in with plexi-glass presumably to thwart people from breaking in. In theory, that's a great idea--but in practice, there is no way to cool down the room with outside air because the windows don't open. In the bedroom portion of the Ashleigh Suite, the windows do open but, beware--there are things one should know. The bedroom portion faces what is, in essence, a small courtyard. It's a narrow courtyard and each room (from the ground level where the Ashleigh Suite is) to the top floor faces one another. That's not really unexpected because it's a small, older building. BUT--the narrow courtyard has become a disgusting pigeon sanctuary filled with pigeon poop; fighting birds, white feathers on the window sills and constant cooing. Why can't they get someone out there once a month or so and just wash it down with a garden hose? Why can't they do something to keep the birds out of there? If you don't need to open the windows, then this is a non-issue. But if you want fresh air in the room (remember, there is no A/C), expect everything connected with pigeons. Oh--and by the way--the cooks who come in at 5:30 to get the complimentary breakfast prepared can be heard from the Ashleigh Suite...if you decide to leave the windows open. It is almost as if they were in your room. I can only guess that the kitchen must be right under the Suite. I'm sure they would have lowered their voices if we had called the front desk, but should one have to call the front desk for something like this at a place with a lot of diamonds and stars? The decor in the Ashleigh Suite is nice but beware--it's getting tired and worn and sooner, rather than later, the owners are going to perform an overhaul. Two of the lamps were broken and fell apart when turned on. The bedspread was, when it was newer, nice--but now it's getting old. The bathrooms (there are two in the Ashleigh Suite because it's basically two connecting rooms) are very clean but still, feeling their age. How about some new tile on the floors? Don't get me wrong. The place is nice. The location is outstanding. The valet parking works fine. (It costs $34 per night and you have to wait 30 minutes between calling for the car and getting it--but that's manageable). The breakfasts are plentiful with fresh fruit, pastries, quiche, sausage and toast. Pretty much the same things everyday--but still, above average...and included in the rate. The room refrigerators are stocked with complimentary waters and soft drinks. How many places do you know that do that? The afternoon wine and cheese is a very nice touch although, on one night, they served a green salad, of all things. There were other things like green olives but the salad was odd...and not very practical. Still, though, it's complimentary. There is a small patio off of the main dining area--BUT--it was locked and not very inviting. The bottom line: Good place, nice location, friendly people BUT--the owners better start thinking about quality control and attention to details. \"Quality control\" and \"attention to details\" are, after all is said and done, factors which help decide just how many diamonds and stars there will be.", "Date": "August 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "AllyK4", "Title": "\u201cExcellent boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "AllyK4", "ReviewID": "UR8382973", "Content": "We stayed at the White Swan in June 2007 and thought it was a very nice boutique style hotel.

We got the valet parking added to the price of the room, and I can wholeheartedly recommend this service. They took care of the car for me and as anyone knows, parking in SF is horrible! Not to have to worry about our car was great. We let them know we needed it extra early in the morning and it was waiting for us when we needed it. The breakfast was great. Homemade breads, quiche, sausage, oatmeal, cereals, fresh fruit, coffee and tea were provided (more, I'm sure, but we couldn't try it ALL).

It was beautiful -- spacious and tastefully decorated. We loved the gas fireplace and turned it on each evening. Be advised that even in the middle of summer, San Francisco has chilly nights! The breakfast buffet was varied and we found it filling. Fresh fruit, pastries, cereals, an egg flan, bacon, sausage or ham, juice, coffee and tea were available each morning. The afternoon wine reception was another perk. On Friday evening, there was live music -- a delightful guitar and flute duo. We also like the fresh cookies and around the clock availability of coffee and tea. The location is up the hill from Union Square. We had no trouble walking to the Square, Moscone (Convention) Center or to the Curran Theatre to see Jersey Boys. The walk UP the hill was a bit challenging and I wouldn't recommend trying to negotiate it with luggage in tow. However, going DOWN the hill with luggage was no problem and we walked for several blocks on a Sunday morning to get to the Powell St. BART station for a $6.35 trip to Oakland Airport. On the way in, we took BART to Powell St. and then hopped in a taxi to the White Swan Inn. (An additional $10 that included a tip for the driver.) This hotel is part of the Joie de Vivre chain of California hotels. Before booking the White Swan Inn, I'd suggest joining the free Joie de Vivre Club, which gets you points towards free amenities as well as a choice of gifts upon arrival in any of their hotels.

We wanted to stay in a cute, unique boutique kind of hotel and not a big hotel chain and that is exactly what we got. I'll try to break down this review to make it helpful. 1. Room & Decor: We stayed in a Luxury King Room on the top floor after finding a great deal on it. If you like that old world, european kind of charm then these rooms are definitely for you. We liked the antique style furniture, wood floors by the entry, the little nook with the fridge, the separate vanity area and walk-in closet, fireplace, down comforter, soft linens, etc. It was plenty big. Like I mentioned, the decor is for those that like that old european feel, not for those looking to stay in a room from a hotel chain; it's not like a hilton, marriott, etc. It's definitely not modern. --Being a smaller boutique hotel, it does not tower over it's neighboring buildings; therefore, it does not offer much of a view. On the top floor we were able to see the tops of several tall buldings but that is it. 2. Cleanliness: We were generally pleased with this. Yes, it is an older place so the bathrooms are not sparkling new; it has an older tub, toilet, etc. Even the carpets and such are older but they were vaccumed regularly. But it was definitely clean and hygenic. My wife and I didn't mind this at all because we were expecting it to be older, but we never had any problems with the cleanliness of it. I didn't give the place a white glove test but nothing stood out in our time there. 3. Service: We had great service our entire trip. Turn down service was offered every night, linens and towels were changed promptly when requested, etc. Even when we refused turn-down service they still offered us chocolates. --On our first night the bellboy (I think that's what he was) noticed we did not have a VCR in the room and immediately went and got one. --The front desk probably got tired of all the questions about restaurants and directions that we asked but they were very polite and answered each one. We were given some great suggestions on places to eat (Cafe Claude, Mama's, Kate's Kitchen, etc.) and contrary to some other experiences on here, they called a cab for us right away when we needed it on our last day. I guess it depends on who is there. --When I booked the room I asked the front desk if they do anything for honeymooners and was told they would try and do something. I wasn't expecting anything but they were so gracious and had champagne, chocolates, and a teddy bear waiting there. 4. No A/C: When booking the hotel room I called a bunch of boutique and non-boutique hotels and asked a few questions. I was surprised to find out that most of the boutique styled hotels don't have A/C. I was a bit nervous about this but it was not a problem at all (we were there at the beginning of July). With the windows open we were actually cold at night. Maybe it was because we were on the top floor but the breeze was nice and steady and at times, actually too cold. I googled the climate in SF and I found that Aug and Sept are hotter than Jun/Jul, so I guess we went at a good time, especially with the heat wave that just passed through. 5. Location: Up towards nob hill, it is about a 10 min walk to Union Square (shopping, public transportation to almost anywhere in SF), a 5 min walk to Powell St (to catch the cable car, if you'll be taking this or other public transport a lot I suggest getting a pass, otherwise it's like $5 a ride, it was totally worth it for us), 10 min to China town. Since it is up nob hill, walking anywhere means going up/down hills. We didn't mind it but if you hate walking up/down hills this might not be for you. --Being away from union square I never had a problem with beggars or people I thought might mug me. We saw a few crazier looking people every now and then, but they never bothered us and from everything I've heard, the trouble is more down in tenderloin and some other districts on the other side of Union square. I actually saw quite a few college aged kids walking around the area. 6. Breakfast: We really enjoyed the breakfast here, although I have had better breakfasts at other hotels. They offered a variety of sliced fruits (melons, etc.) and some standard fruits (apples, bananas, etc.). They always had hot oatmeal. They also had quiche. I had it hot and recently brought out all but one time, so I guess I had good timing. I can see why some people would have complained about the cold quiche. I at the last slice once and I think it had been sitting there for a while. It wasn't the best but it still tasted all right. They also offer a variety of cold cereal, orange juice, coffee, etc. They usually have some sort of breakfast meat as well, usually sausage or sausage patty. Once again, these items were great when hot, but sometimes they were sitting out for a while. 7. The Cookie Jar: When you first come in and go up the small flight of stairs to the front desk, there is a cookie jar on an armoir at the top of the stairs. They usually stock that with great cookies/other baked goods and everynight when we came back there was some sort of dessert sitting by that jar, like bundt cake, lemon bars, etc. Needless to say we loved getting that little treat each time we came back. 8. The elevator: Yes, this elevator is an old elevator; one of those where you have to close an outer sliding door and inner gate in order for it to work. This goes back to the old world, european thing. We loved it and thought it was the cutest thing (it is decorated well and we never had a problem with it not working; just remember to close both doors after you exit). However, if you're looking for something more modern this might not be the place for you. Ok that was the longest review of all time. Overall we had a great experience there; we liked our room, had great service, and would definitely go back, especially if I got such a great deal again. But like I've said, it's for those who want that old, antique kind of experience. For those that want more modern, there are some other great hotels in SF that I'm sure you'll love.", "Date": "August 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "greensboro nc", "Title": "\u201cgreat inn within walking distance to everything\u201d", "Author": "luvmyyellowlab", "ReviewID": "UR5573345", "Content": "Stayed at the White swan Inn 2 nights the first week of August.

The complimentary breakfast is excellent with a minor flaw (which I hope they will fix, at my suggestion.) The cooks are very good, with a assortment of nice baked goods, fruits, breads and cereals. The hot dishes would have been excellent if the serving pieces kept them hot. Again, the cooks know what they are doing with the baked eggs dishes, meat, and potatoes that were served avery morning, but the hotel needs to invest in better electric or chafing serving pieces to do them justice. Nice complimentary wine and hors d'ouevres at cocktail time. The lounge areas are very comfortable, nicely decorated, and people can spread out.

I asked to switch rooms, but the only one available with a refinished bathtub had a BROKEN FIREPLACE!!! Real classy. #2 If you have eyesight problems, don't try to watch TV. It's a million miles away from the bed. #3 The bed is REALLY comfy, but the rest of the room needs help. #4 Old, old, old elevator. #5 OK, ok... So it's within walking distance of Union Square & Chinatown. However, all the hotels along Powell Street (Westin St. Francis, Chancellor, etc.) are MUCH more convenient!!! If you want to stay off Powell, choose The Orchard. The saving grace of this B&B is the yummy breakfast buffet, the SUPERIOR wine/ fruit & cheese sampling at 5:00pm, and the adorable bellman, Louis. The only way that I would ever stay at this B&B again is if they sent me a voucher for a free night's stay AFTER they refinished the ALL bathtubs & fixed ALL the fireplaces. Otherwise, for the hefty $200 price tag, I'm at the Westin St. Francis.

Our last two nights were spent at the White Swan Inn in San Francisco and we weren't disappointed. The first impression we had was of the friendliness of the reception staff. They were very helpful and gave us so much information and advice regarding restaurants, bars etc. We were very impressed with our room...lovely furnishings and lots of space which we don't seem to get in English hotels! Within minutes we had a knock on the door to enquire if we had everything we required...a very nice touch. The hotel has lots of character and we were very pleasantly surprised to find we could meet up with fellow guests late afternoons for a buffet and wine etc in the lounge...just what the doctor ordered after a hard day's sight seeing. The White Swan's location is very central and only a few minutes walk down hill to Union Square and China Town....we took the cable car back which dropped us off close to the hotel. All in all, a great end to a brilliant holiday and I would certainly recommend the White Swan to anyone wanting a central hotel with great value for money.", "Date": "May 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201coverrated\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3432647", "Content": "this is an okay hotel, but a bit overrated on tripadvisor. * the room was okay, but the fireplace was not working, and even though we asked them to fix it, it never got fixed during our stay. there is no bath tub, just a shower. * the breakfast is alright, better than the breakfast at a holiday inn, but not as good as a bed & breakfast. * the elevator was terrible; it was old, and if someone forgot to close the door (it didn't shut automatically), nobody could use the elevator. several times, we had to use the stairs to get to our room on the top floor. we switched to a different hotel (commodore) after two days.", "Date": "May 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wyoming", "Title": "\u201cthe good and the bad.. still my favorite\u201d", "Author": "flifish", "ReviewID": "UR3374855", "Content": "I feel with all the gleaming reviews I must try to give a clear picture of this Inn. While this is not a luxurious Inn it has what many places are missing, and is my favorite SF hotel. A personality, wonderful customer service, clean nice sized rooms with fireplaces, a good breakfast with fresh fruit, eggs, and more, and an afternoon wine reception where you can visit with other guests. This Inn is not perfect but the staff is clearly trained very well to be friendly and helpful with suggestions for restaurants, sites, and shopping. The property is not a swank, modern, marble headstone for the new age. No credit card like key for the doors, you buzz to enter this hotel then given your own \"house\" keys. It reminds you of what the name implies, a country Inn, which reminiscent of staying at Aunt Mary's house, only much better. The hallway to the rooms are a little dark and may give you the idea that you choose the wrong hotel. However, when you open the door to your room you will know you are home. The fireplace rooms are large for a city hotel with books on the shelves, homey wallpaper, and windows that open. The ample sized bathroom, while not new, has tub with shower curtains, hair dryer, quality shampoos and lotions, is clean and comfortable, as with most hotels this one could use some more shelf space in the bathroom. their web site lists various amenities. The location is about 3 blocks from union square proper. Within site of the hotel are some small neighborhood grocery type stores where you can restock on forgotten items and restaurants nearby.", "Date": "April 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, CO", "Title": "\u201cIncredibly romantic\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3340561", "Content": "I called the White Swan Inn to check out staying there for what could be the most romantic weekend of my life with a man I've been in love with for 32 years but never with as a couple. Right away they asked me about my expectations for my stay in SF. I told them the above statement and they sprung into action. A few days later, I received a call from Nevin with ideas on how together we could make this a stay right out of the movies. I have never experienced that level of service or enthusiasm that they showed for a potential guest. They were good to their word and made our stay something right out of the most romantic movie ever. They offered such personal and world class service without being invasive. We were bowled over by their thoughfulness. The rooms look like they belong in a Jane Austen novel with every thoughtful detail attended to. Throughout the stay everyone at the hotel was so gracious. Even as we checked out the bellboy brought bottles of water to our car for the ride. It was such a great feeling to have the staff go beyond your expectations at every turn. I would highly recommend this hotel for location, for the quaint charm and for the first rate service. The price was very reasonable for what you received. Even as we enjoyed sherry in the late afternoon, we were greeted by the manager of the hotel. It was truly lovely and ranks at the top of my list ( and I have stayed at such notable hotels as The Penisula in Hong Kong.)
