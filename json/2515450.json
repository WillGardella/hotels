While the hotel was well off the beaten path, it worked out well for us. Hard to get a bite to eat though. Wendy's at the Pilot gas station down the street was the closest option...That's something you should know if you decide to stay out this way. The hotel itself was very nice. Good rooms, comfortable beds and nice staff. The breakfast in the morning is up to par with any other HI Express, so it was good. This property is very close to the Border - that wasn't a factor for me, but it makes some folks uncomfortable. I didn't have any anxiety about it and I don't think that you should either. If you need to be down this way, well away from the heart of San Diego, this is a fine place to stay the night.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orem, Utah", "Title": "\u201cVery reasonably priced but far from city center\u201d", "Author": "PrasoonChoudhary", "ReviewID": "UR119978834", "Content": "The room was very good and clean.

The hotel can be a little hard to find, so print directions before you head there! The drive to downtown San Diego is really no big deal and we never hit any significant traffic!

The free internet access was fast! The desk was big enough and plenty of sockets for my gizmos. The room also smelled good. What I do is drive my car to the paid parking lot right near the border then walk across and take a taxi to my destination.

Yes, it is very close to the border however it is an easy 20 min car ride to San diego. This saved on city hotel parking fees at $14 a night. Hotel staff very helpful and pleasant. Breakfast nothing exciting but fruit and cereal available as well as greasy stuff. Coffee is horrible there is a Starbucks up the road which really helped. Housekeeping left the room really fresh every day with new soap, towels every day. Great to have a microwave and fridge, laundry was useful too as we needed to freshen clothes as only brought a few. Rooms were spacious - we had a suite which had a little seating area with a sofa bed and table, beds very comfortable and so were the pillows. There are some really good restaurants in Otay ranch to the north 14 miles away or 4miles via 125 toll rd $4.50, local fast food places too. Free internet access and a business centre with a printer so we bough discount tickets before we went to attractions an saved a load of $ doing this too. For our family this was ideal as we got breakfast and no parking fees and were going to be going in the car on trips every day. Easy to get to legoland, San diego zoo, etc, we even ended up in Yuma AZ one day!

The staff were very attentive and nothing was too much trouble for them. Only down side was the air conditioning unit located on the roof.

If it weren't for that, I'd give this a 5-star rating. This place is right close to the Mexican border - it's fun to look out your bedroom window into Tijuana as I did.
