Hotel is small but you are aware of that before you book. Rooms clean and modern. If fancy a feel for what Paris has to offer I would recommend this Hotel as its not a chain like your Holiday Inns, Premier Lodges, Its quaint and Beautiful leading you into little streets where you get a feel for Paris and not just the sights. Chez Leon is a wonderful place to eat and is just round the corner from the hotel Red Bus tour well worth the money can stop off and get on through all the sights.

Staff speak good English (so no need to worry if your French is rusty) and were friendly and welcoming (as were all the Parisians we met). We arrived 2 hours early and had emailed in advance to see if we could store our luggage if rooms unavailable. This was possible but was not necessary as our rooms were ready early. We were also permitted to leave our luggage on our 3rd day till long after check out which was very much appreciated as we could make the most of our last day in Paris (train home was at 2013). Breakfast is in a charming little room in the basement and was good with plenty of coffee, tea, juice, fresh bread, croissants, pastries, toast, yoghurt & fruit and was complimentary which was a nice bonus. We didn\u2019t use the garden as it was -10 degrees during our stay, but would imagine it would be nice to sit out during the summer with a glass of wine!

To our surprise, the front of the building, which looked vacant, was covered with construction material. No outside lights were on. The 'clerk' who met us was dressed in a tee shirt and looked unkempt. A bed was set up in the front lobby. Where were we??? Being too tired to go elsewhere, we took our room and spent the night worrying. The following morning, the new desk clerk was dressed appropriately, the bed was gone and everything seemed fine. We decided to stay, writing off our late evening entry as a bit of an anomoly. The hotel is reasonable for a 3-star European properety. Rooms are small but clean, well decorated and maintained. The elevator is tiny, so my wife who is somewhat claustophobic refused to use it, taking four flights of stairs instead. If you don't like tiny elevators, ask for a room on a lower floor. The garden that they advertise is quite small and looked forlorn in late October. The surrounding buildings are not attractive and so detract from the appearance of that garden. Breakfast was small but adequate with only cold items as is the norm on that continent. It is provided in a basement 'cavern' which is well lit and charming, but the tables are very small and jammed in there. In high season, it might be a challenge to find a space. This boutique hotel is on a quiet street, seems to be well managed and, absent the oddities that we experienced on our first night, it may be a reasonable place to stay in Paris. By now, the reconstruction of the exterior front may be complete. It is only a short walk to the Metro and perhaps a 15/20 minute walk to the Champs-Elysses. There are a number of decent restaurants and cafes nearby, as well as a market street which was fascinating with foods and clothing for sale in sidewalk booths.

There is a garden at the back but the 4 tables there hold overflowing ashtrays most days I was there. One day, someone finally decided to clean the ashtrays but took so long to return them to the tables in the garden so smokers littered the garden with cigarette butts. They also said wifi is free... that is if you can connect to wifi at all. On our first day, we had a very strong signal in our room at the 4th floor. The rest of our stay, we had to make trips to the ground floor (or to the garden) to get a signal. Or, I stand outside my room near the staircase and I get a signal when I am lucky, but not always. Yes, we told the front desk (many times actually I almost sounded like I was whining)... Laurent, Jean-Paul, and the 2 different men who manned the night shift. But not much success. We also paid extra for a room with a balcony (where I can smoke). But we were not told the facade of the building was undergoing a face lift (although I never saw anyone working during the 4 days I was there) so the scaffolding covered the balcony, and it was very dusty. Someone posted a review here with a picture of the hotel's facade. I read the reviews for this hotel before I went to Paris for the very first time, so my expectations over the breakfast fare, the size of the room, etc. were managed.... so except for the erratic wifi connection (which was very important to me as I had to communicate with people almost halfway across the globe, 6 time zones away), I consciously looked beyond these \"imperfections\" as Laurent and Jean Paul assisted me with making arrangements for shuttle service and allowed me to print my boarding pass from their computers.

Breakfast is the worst I have ever had, and I travel a lot and are not very demanding. Very, VERY limited choice, not even fresh fruit but some canned and only if you are lucky to be on time. Toaster is disgusting to see, rusted, dirty as most other utensilis. If there is not enough jam or cheese and you ask the lady she will bring you one piece and put it in your hand, no chance to supply more on serving table for others, they are obviously instructed to save the food as much as they can. So, it is budget hotel and do not expect luxury but for 3* one can ask at least clean room and decent breakfast, you will not get it in this hotel but Paris is full of hotels and check as many trustworthy reviews as you can, this hotel on web site and in reality are very different.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA little gem. A great location. In a city you discover by stumbling upon!\u201d", "Author": "thewiredwanderer", "ReviewID": "UR117456293", "Content": "The Jardin De Villiers is a gem \u2013 which we found on TripAdvisor. Located in the 17th arondissement (district) of Paris, this hotel is warm, friendly, small, and well positioned for the Paris tourist. We were three (with our 11 year old son), and the staff made their best efforts to provide the best possible rooms and always, always, service and a welcome with a smile. We have nothing but good things to say about this little gem \u2013 which by the way, is a minute's walk away from street markets, restaurants and caf\u00e9s, fruit and veggie vendors, and a pretty good sized supermarket \u2013 Monoprix. The location is really amazing. We were: \u2022 2 minutes from the Villers Metro station \u2022 15 minutes walk from the Arc de Triomphe and Champs-Elysees \u2022 20 minutes walk from Montmarte area and the Sacre-Cour (amazing views!) \u2022 15 minute walk from Flunch \u2013 budget eatery that's a rage in Paris \u2022 About 1/2 hour's walk to the Left Bank \u2022 About a 10 minute, one-change train ride to the Eiffel Tower and more... The hotel rates are decently priced, and the room rates we had included a typical Continental Breakfast \u2013 crusty bread, (various) croissants, yogurt, fruit cups, toast, jam, cheeses, and delicious coffee and real tea. We were thrilled to find Darjeeling tea \u2013 which we found hard to find in hotels even in tea-loving England! We would haver loved to see some fresh fruit or perhaps a few slices of cold meats \u2013 but overall, we were pretty happy with breakfast \u2013 served in a very special cellar like room. The extremely cheerful staff were always at hand to re-fill anything that ran out \u2013 and although we did get bored with eating the same thing day after day for seven days \u2013 it was a great start to the day in Paris. The rooms are small but tidy. Apparently most Paris rooms are small, and we were three in a room probably meant for two, but with the additional bed the hotel provided we were fine. We had a great view from the large French windows and the balcony we had on the 4th floor. The room has an ensuite bathroom with a decent shower. The tv is basic French, and we only has like CNN and BBC on. Paris has so much to do and see, don't panic on the tv. The city has better views! And, of course, there's a quant little garden whichyou can pop out to \u2013 either with a glass of wine and a fine Cuban in the evening, or with your coffee in the morning. No comment on the rooms at the Jardin De Villiers would be complete without a comment on the beds. I have a back condition for years, but those seven nights I was near pain free. The beds are so good, we tried to track down the manufacturer. From the moment we checked in to the time we checked out, we must acknowledge the fantastic front desk staff at the JDV. Laurent who was our first point of welcome, was good humored and welcoming. Actually, every one was great. They all spoke English, and I guess they all help you, working literally like the Concierge at a larger hotel. They were very sensitive to our needs, helping us book taxis, providing little tips, maps, and great words of advice. One comment about the neighborhood... Watch out as you walk around the narrow streets \u2013 the pavements are covered with dog poo. There is no poop-and-scoop policy in Paris, and particularly where we were, this was one fresh fertilizer farm! At the end of the our week in Paris we realized we had a great time. Literally a couple of minutes from the hotel are great fruit stalls, butcheries with ready foods, great wine stores, many restaurants and bakeries \u2013 and if the doggie-do isn't overpowering on that given day, the various aromas of bread baking, chicken on the rotisserie, or fresh fruit in the sun being sold by eager, friendly farmers is amazing. Couple of words of advice on Paris: \u2022 Get the 10-pack of metro/train/bus tickets. It's called a carnet. We got ours for cash (Euro 12.50 for ten)(and slightly discounted because you buy 10 at a time). Near the JDV is the Villiers Metro station (2 mins) which easily connects to the RER trains which take you to all the main sights in Paris. \u2022 We had tickets left over because we discovered that there is so much to see just walking around in the magical (but dirty) city, that we did NOT want to be underground unless we were absolutely tired or late. \u2022 Walk along both banks of the River if you can. Both banks have their charm. Discover by stumbling upon. \u2022 Most people miss the Concorde monument \u2013 a gift from Egypt. The site of many a guillotine moment \u2013 including Marie Antoinette's! The place is amazing, surrounded by fantastic fountains, views of the Tour Eiffel and the astounding Touilerie garden. \u2022 No, the French in Paris are not like the faux-French in Montreal (we are Canadians, we know!). They will speak to you in English if they can, there is no language snobbery like most people think. We had wonderful experiences on the trains or the streets with just ordinary, every day Parisians doing great little cameos as tour guides. \u2022 Food is expensive. Wine is cheaper than water. \u2022 If you are on a budget, or just for fun try Flunch. This is a multiple outley eatery that serves decent food and all-you-can-eat sides of veggies, mash, fries etc with your main entree at ridiculous prices. The Flunch we stumbled upon was near Montmarte. \u2022 The tiny Chinese/Vietnamese/Japanese places are good deals, usually. Indian is expensive \u2013 often unexplainably so. The typical Paris bistros and cafe's are great. \u2022 Do stop for a breather at a park. The parks are a breath of fresh air (literally!). I could go on. And sound like a Paris and a hotel PR person. But we really did have such a splendid time, that we wanted to share all our positives with every one intending to go out there. One last word. From our 11-year old, for all those with pre-teen kids. No we did not go to Disneyland Paris. We found so much in the city itself, we kind of took the (kid's) road less travelled.

There is also a supermarket and market stalls so if you are on a budget these are a great option! We got the RER from Charles De Gaulle and then the metro line 2 to Villiers, from there waked 10 mins (didnt quite know at this point where to go) to the hotel.

It was also clean and although there are some imperfections it was easy to overlook them as it did not impact our stay. I imagine most of the people complaining about the breakfast are probably American as most people seem to be expecting this huge buffet breakfast. Yes it is a buffet but it is continental which means croissants, brioche, pain au chocolat, yoghurts and a few other tasty things. Its not bacon and eggs, and to find that in France is going to be very strange. Breakfast was always nice and everything went smoothly. Smartphone Users - I have an Android and anyone else who does really should get the \"Metro 01\" app from the app store. If you know the name of your station and the station you want to go to (look at the metro map) then this app lets you what lines to get on and where to switch, perfect!

Before we left, we had good contact with Laurent at the hotel who arranged our airport transfer very swiftly. He was genuinely helpful via e-mail and put us in a confident mood prior to our arrival. When we arrived, the receptionist was amenable and we went in possibly the smallest lift in the world up to our room (room 31). You could barely get two people and a suitacse in this lift!!! We had booked a superior room which was anything but. You could hear the adjacent lift shaft very well. I actually went down to reception to check they had given us the right room. Sadly they had. The walls of the room were dusty and we had a plastic patio chair at the 'desk'. The TV wall mounting was loose and the bathroom had so many cracked tiles it was unreal. The shower screen was too small so the bathroom floor got soaking wet but we decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and see how the weekend went. The next morning, we went down to breakfast and were stunned at how small the breakfast room was (the hotel website photo is very misleading). For a hotel with 26 rooms, there were eight tables in there with only some of them dressed. Eventually the staff bought out some plates etc but to be honest there was no point as the selection was poor. It's not like we got down there just before breakfast ended, we were quite early. The next day, we had been out all day and came back for a freshen up prior to going out to dinner. It was about 4.30pm and we were a bit bemused to see the entrance was locked. Pressing the bell got no response. Eventually, our banging on the door woke the receptionist up from his sleep he was enjoying in the reception seating area and he let us in. I couldn't get his name as he wasn't wearing a name badge. He looked like we were asking a lot of him to be let in!!! This is inexcusable. He didn't even apologise. The next morning, the usual problems with breakfast, had to wait about 5 minutes before a member of staff realised we were waiting for some plates and off she walked whilst sighing to get them. The hotel itself is quite well located for the Metro at Villiers and outside the hotel is a nice market selling great fresh fruit and bakery items. Unfortunately just one of few positives. When we checked out, nobody asked us how our stay had been or seemed remotely interested in if we were happy with our room and to be honest I got the impression they didn't really care. I know a lot of people have rated this hotel highly but I just can't see it. Whether we were unlucky or just went at a bad time for the hotel I don't know but it was very disappointing. If you are going to Paris, stay elsewhere!! We are not snobs, nor do we stay in lavish hotels but this was one of the worst hotel experiences we have had and it really spoilt the weekend.

This wasnt a problem as the staff let us leave our bags while we looked around the town. The rooms are small but comfortable and clean. We stayed there for 3 nights and each afternoon there were clean towels and sheets. The front of house staff were really nice and helpful when it came to helping us plan our day on the tube as it can get confusing at times. They hand out maps and tour guides which is a nice added touch. The location of this hotel is great. You have the little town which is 5 minutes walk which has nice little shops and eating places. Its near the main tube station which takes you to the centre of Paris. Its quiet and you feel safe walking at night. The only bad point I would raise is the breakfast. The breakfast room is such a pretty little area but I think the lack of staff means it doesnt get cleaned up in time for the people waiting to eat. When you just woken up and want to get out to sight see this is a little annoying. The choice of food wasnt the best. You get crusty bread with cheese, pasteries and fruit. But some mornings they wouldnt have anything left. The last morning we were due to leave I only had a piece of toast and a hot chocolate because there was no milk or breads, I was starving to say the least. But overall I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family as its great.

This arrondisement will be fairly close for him to travel to work and still rates high on the safety, etc rankings for arrondisements. So we wanted to get a closer look. The hotel: Is very quaint. It's on a quiet residential side street. If you're light sleeper or really need your rest, I highly recommend this place! We had a courtyard room and just opened the window at night to let in a cool breeze. The rooms are extremely small, but that's typical for Europe. There's a small closet, desk, chair, bed, footstool, and small nightstands on either side of the bed. The bathroom was a little lacking in the repair area. The floor tiles were cracked, luckily they give you a pair of slippers. The towels are a little thread bare as someone else mentioned. But the shower alone is enough to make up for those 2 small things. I don't think I've ever had a nice a shower away from home as here. I seriously almost asked where they got the shower heads from...it was that good. Shampoo and soap is supplied. No washcloths though. The bathroom was very bright though, great for applying makeup or shaving. They do request you leave your key at the front desk when you leave. Kind of disturbing at first, especially since there are no safes in the rooms, but we didn't have any problems. And the key chain is kind of bulky, so I'm glad we didn't have to keep up with it. I'd suggest always carrying your passport and wallet with you. The breakfast was okay and traditional European flair...bread, pastries, jellies, yogurt and cheese. Juice, milk, coffee and tea. I highly recommend two restaurants near the hotel, I believe the hotel does too. If you exit to the right out of the hotel and go down to Legendre. Turn left and there's a pizza place. yum!! and if you turn right and head down a block or two to Crepe & Co. Excellent!! Another plus to this hotel is its proximity to 2 metro lines!! They go in opposite directions from this station, so there aren't too many places you can't get to! The neighborhood is great and I actually found it to be very similar to other neighborhoods in Paris. There's a great market street just around the corner from the hotel, with a grocery store, wine stores, restaurants, shops, etc...all to help you get a good look at Parisienne life!
