{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very good value and short walk to everything The other reviews here does in general not do this hotel justice. What do you expect when you can get a single room for $ 42 on Priceline? I enjoyed my stay here, and would easily recommend it to people who are traveling with an open mind and who have spent a night in a hostel or a low-key hotel before. I had a room with a shared bath room in the hallway (but it seemed like I was the only one using it, so there was no line or dirt in the there.) The room was decent enough, with an old television set that seemed to be from the 1970's that did not have more than a few channels with bad reception, but it was a pretty cool piece of history, and who's in San Francisco to watch TV anyway? The windows were slightly dirty and facing the street, but I didn't experience much noise. It's in the Tenderloin, which means that you can walk to the BART train or the cable car in a few minutes, and to Union Square too. There's been said a lot about the Tenderloin on Trip Advisor before, and I'm not gonna pretend that it's a particularly beautiful place, and there's a lot of homeless people on the streets, but they never even asked for change as I walked through the neighborhood many times, and they never seemed to bother anyone. In my opinion, it's an area that you can easily stay in and walk through anytime if you're a guy or in a group, although I can understand it if single females or families with kids do not wish to spend a lot of time here. I don't think much is going to happen to anyone, except perhaps being if you can spare a dime. I was also gonna say that the hotel may not be the best spot for a romantic holiday, but now I just remembered that the couple in the room next door were gettin' it on both when I checked in at night and also the next morning when I woke up (the walls are VERY thin), so I might have to reconsider that thought. If you're open minded, want to save a lot of money, and don't mind seeing the slightly shadier sides of California, this is a pretty good deal.", "Date": "Aug 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR554660842", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ssaethre"}, {"Content": "S**t Hole I would say my stay at this hotel was worse than terrible.

The area there however was not very noisy. I was a bit nervous and scared at my first day there because of the amount of homeless people over there. However, during my remaining 4 days stay, i was used to it. The big tip is not to care about any of the homeless people. They would ask u for money, u can just ignore them and nothing bad would happen. By seeing this fact, I think it is quite a peaceful street to live in. In terms of service and facility of the hotel, they have a tv set and an attached bathroom in my hotel room. Nothing is particularly unpleasant. They also provide free breakfast every 7am to 9am.

Outside there were many people wandering around drinking, with some sleeping on the street while others were selling items until 5am - 6am each morning. Outside the Hotel, there were people having mini-fights and yelling to each other all night - this was along all the streets nearby so it was very noisy even with bedroom window shut. In the day-time groups of men were blocking footpaths, needing me to either walk through them or go onto the road amongst traffic. Most of these people were drinking or had difficulty walking.A feeling of being unsafe was strong, but I did stay as I had pre-paid.

When i parked right in front by a meter, a homeless man knocked on my window and asked me if i needed any aids refering to drugs. Another lady was right in front swigging down a cheap bottle of vodka at noon.

I got a terrific deal on a travel web site. 4 nights for $134 on my charge card bill, including all taxes and charges (I didn't use the phone anyway). Don't think you can find a better deal ($33.50 a night) anywhere in sf. True, it is not in a good area (tenderloin district), but I think if you practice awareness and watch your surroundings at all times you are relatively safe staying there. I wouldn't stay at this hotel with my girlfriend or wife and family if I had one, you should spend a little more to stay at a better hotel in a nicer neighborhood, but as a single guy on a budget this is a good bare bones place to stay. There is a police station right around the corner so there were police walking the area at night after midnight. I didn't expect much, didn't care about pastries for breakfast (but what do you expect when you pay $33 a day?) and went out to the corner diner for breakfast. There is a chinese restaurant on the corner next door and other places to eat in the area. close to the #19 bus that takes you to ghiradelli square and is about 3 blocks from the bart station. It is about 6 blocks from union square so not very far from the action. while I was there, there were groups of females and males staying in the hotel for halloween and they were coming and going at all hours of the night so I felt comfortable there. Even when they left after halloween, the hotel was a little empty but I didn't feel threatened at all in the hotel. Hotel management locks the door after 11 at night so you have to show your room key if they don't recognize you. You can call the hotel to warn them of you coming at night so they will let you in quickly if you are afraid of being mugged. yes, there were bunches of suspect people hanging around the neighborhood at all hours of the day and night, but I didn't see any drug dealing and wasn't bothered by any of these people and I ignored any of them that tried to get money from me. Most of the time I would cross the street or walk on the street to avoid any encounters and wasn't bothered by any of them. BTW, this hotel and the aida hotel on market street are owned and run by the same people. So if you just need a decent place to stay at a great price, the verona is all right. But if you want to stay at a nicer place in a safer neighborhood, you will be paying more than double the price. Just my 2 cents, hope it helps others who are looking for a cheap place to stay.
