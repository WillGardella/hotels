They're unlike any hotel I've ever experienced before (and Ive stayed in some real nice places), but I'll try anyway. Firstly, every aspect of your stay is planned to make sure you're never left wanting for anything. From the moment you enter skylofts, you're treated like royalty. I could mention all the really amazing touches, but most other people have reviewed those, so lets just say you will be blown away. All of the staff, from the cleaners, to the butlers, to the concierge, are at the top of their game and excellent at what they do. Granted SkyLofts is not cheap, expect to pay around $1200 a night for a 2 bed suite, or an eye-watering $5000 a night for a 2 bed balcony suite. Dont make the mistake I did and assume that all skylofts have a balcony. There are only 2 of them in the whole hotel with a pool and balcony. I spent a long time planning what hotel to stay at, and I have to say, the decor at skylofts is amazing. I checked other luxury Vegas hotels but even the Bellagio looked tacky and a bit distasteful to me. If you stay at SkyLofts, be sure to take advantage of eating at the Mansion (available only to SkyLoft guests and high rollers). This is some of the best food Ive ever tasted in my life, and coupled with some amazing cocktails and attentive staff, it was a really memorable experience. Not to mention you get VIP escorted through the casino on the way to the restaurant, which doesn't hurt the ego ;-) Room service deserves a mention. There are about 10-12 restaurants in MGM, and you can pick and choose any mix of dishes from any of them, and have them delivered to your room in less than 40 minutes. We had some amazing burgers in our loft at 5am (arrived within 20 minutes), and a delicious lobster benedict at 10am. Theres a whole heap of other services, such as in-room massages, and complimentary suit pressing. Be nice to the butler and cleaners, they're just normal people but have to act professional. Its customary to tip, I dont know what the going rate is but for a 2 day stay we tipped butler $100, cleaners $50 and concierge $50. We were also treated to a ride in a Rolls Royce Ghost who kindly dropped us off at the airport, but you can also get chauffeur driven to anywhere within reason if you ask for it.

The hotel and staff lived up to all of them. We will definitely return. We were greeted immediately after stepping off the plane by a Skylofts representative and escorted to a new large Rolls Royce (apparently they recently traded in the Maybach mentioned on their website last month for the Rolls). We were taken to the Skylofts entrance and greeted by another representative who showed us around the downstairs lobby and private elevator to our room. He then completed the check-in process in our room very quickly. At the same time our butler arrived and she proceeded to show us around the room, tought us how to use the espresso machine, crestron remote control system, tub, steamroom, etc. As mentioned on the website, she offered to unpack for us but we declined. She then offered to steam press clothes that might have been wrinkled from the suitcase, which we accepted. We left the clothes hanging in the entry way while we stepped out for an hour to check out the rest of the hotel. By the time we returned, the clothes were pressed and hanging back in our closet. They also had a very nice cake waiting for us on the dining room table when we arrived. The concierge took care of all our reservations and everywhere we went (dinners and shows) we received the best seats in the house. The room itself was just as represented on the website, modern, clean, spacious, comfortable. The remote control system is great. Very nice to wake up, push a button to open the shades and see the view of the strip that we had (great view from all the windows by the way). Bathroom and steam shower were amazing. We did have one issue during our second night. The audio stopped working on both bathroom televisions. Not a big deal, but within minutes they had a technical team in the room to fix the problem. We ordered breakfast each morning and it was delivered to the room in less than 20 minutes each time, beautifully prepared and set up by the butler. One night we ordered dinner in the room from Craft Steak. Highly recommend this. After having dinner and wine served in our own comfortable room with great views of the strip, we wondered why we bothered going out for dinner on the prior nights. Bottom line, Skylofts and the staff lived up to everything they promise online. I don't think we can stay anywhere else in Vegas again. If I had to suggest any improvement, the only thing I could think of would be for a dedicated pool for Skyloft guests alone. The Four Season and Wynne have separate dedicated pools, which are very relaxing, quiet and have exceptional service. The only downside to Skylofts is that you have to use the main pool complex. Since we stayed mid-week it was not too crowded, but pool service was still slow and inconsistent. It would be nice to continue the same level of Skylofts service out by the pool.", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntington Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cHeavenly, Heavenly, Heavenly\u201d", "Author": "Debi C", "ReviewID": "UR117991592", "Content": "The experience at the Skylofts at the MGM Grand was exquisite!

I\u2019m sad to say but things were a bit off on this trip. Is this a bad sign for the future of this great property or was it just a fluke? I booked a one night (mid-week) stay in July on the way back from CA for some business meetings. One of my employees was traveling with me and deserved a bonus for outstanding work. I chose Skylofts, as I knew that he would be impressed. Here are a few of the issues with the stay. They are one of the only properties I know that can still actually meet you at the airport gate with a sign. Before leaving CA I called the concierge and asked them to change the last name on that sign to reflect my employee\u2019s name. Staying at Skylofts was a surprise and I thought that would be a cool touch. He was seated ahead of me in the plane so he would see it first and it would make for a fun photo. Somehow they failed to get that changed. It was just a minor detail that I'd let slip however it was a sign of things to come. Room upgrade policy. I had booked via AMEX Platinum Travel desk as they have a relationship with this hotel that offers discounts and room upgrades when available. Let me clarify that the automatic upgrade (if available) that AMEX had guaranteed is flat out lie. This is just NOT the case. I had booked a one bedroom and asked for a roll a way bed. Not only did we not get the upgrade to a 2 bedroom but also we had to ask for the roll a way three times before it arrived. That is poor for the typical Skylofts service. Later that night I asked why we were not offered the upgrade to a 2 bedroom. They explained that one was not available that night. I pulled out my computer and showed them that this was not the case as I could clearly book 2 bedroom units right now. Then she explained that it was actually because we had a 4pm late checkout guarantee (AMEX deal) and that tomorrow night they were fully committed. I could see where that would put them in a difficult position. It was a legitimate concern and I offered to be out of the room early. She declined. After a few clicks I showed her that I was also able to book a 2 bedroom for the following night. After a moment of concern she finally quietly explained that they almost never upgrade a one bedroom guest to a two bedroom unit however on occasion a 2 bedroom guest will get upgraded to one of the three bedroom units. That is a very deceptive practice and contradictory to the AMEX statements. I am pleased to say that the rooms still looked good however there were some issues with the Crestron system that could use some attention. Also they never checked towels or refreshed the room when we went out that night. Perhaps they borrowed the training manuals from their sister property the Red Roof Inn! That is really poor service for this level of hotel. The bill was wrong at check out and it took almost 20 minutes to correct the mistakes. To top it all off when we went downstairs they had us listed as a party of 4 for return transfer to the airport. Again sloppy as this was not possible given that we were booked in a one bedroom! This mistake signaled the transportation department to pull the ugly gold colored MGM limo out instead of the sleek Maybach. That was the final letdown and likely a clear response to my upgrade inquiries. The driver was very polite and offered to change cars but the damage was done, and due to the time it took to resolve the billing issues, we could not wait for him to change cars. I still consider it a great deal at $510 per night and enjoyed my stay. If you have never been there and are considering a trip I urge you to book the room right now! You will likely be impressed. The point is that \"you pay for what you get\" and \"you get what you pay for\" in life. It is very clear that the former standards and excellent service at Skylofts has taken a severe hit since my last visit. Perhaps it is due to added competition or the lower room prices. It appears that some of those awesome employees who helped this property stand out have clearly left the building! Finally it was likely my last ride in a Maybach as the driver explained that the leases are up. Apparently they will be changing to a Rolls Ghost. I am sure that it is an awesome car but there was something special about arriving in the Maybach.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAmazing...lavish.

One of my friends asked for a Wii dance/karaoke game to be brought and hooked up to our TV in the loft and the butler said of course, and went and obtained a separate TV and game console with 5 games to choose from and this was at about 4 a.m. in the morning after we had partied for hours at Studio 54. The staff were so kind and conscientious that we were floored. They were always apologetic if something was taken care of immediately which was rare.

Immediately after booking, a concierge contacted me asking about special requests etc, as the show we were seeing was at the MGM, I requested that our tickets be picked up and I mentioned that we were celebrating a birthday. We arrived at the Las Vegas airport and walked off the plane and were immediately greeted by a SkyLofts Driver. He carried our bags to the limo that was awaiting us. Unfortunately the Maybach was not available but it was still a great limo ride and a treat to be escorted from gate to limo. Upon arrival, there were 3 people waiting for us, greeting us by name as we exited the limo. We were taken to a private check in area separate from the main MGM lobby. As we arrived early, our room was not ready, so I asked if there was a good breakfast place....the concierge picked up the phone, got us a table at Mansion for breakfast, and we were escorted to the restaurant. VERY private and away from it all, awesome breakfast! Our room was ready after breakfast......escorted back to the private check in area, then whisked up the private elevators to the top floor of the MGM..elevator door opens and you are in a different world! Blue modern lighting, a very quiet zen like feeling! As we came to our door, there was a private butler with white gloves on, opening our door for us. The room is AMAAAAZING! I cannot stress that enough! HUGE, 2 level Floor to Ceiling windows, 3 flat screens, Bang and Olufson surround sound in the whole place, remote control everything...... anything you could imagine.

I knew we couldn't cater to this room, I didn't realize bringing a few items of my own would be such a big issue. So, if I were to stay in any other room in Vegas, I'm pretty sure this wouldn't have happened. Seriously, you spend $2,500 on a room for ONE night and this is how we get treated?

All you can say about this room was WOW. The actual room is amazing - the pool table was great for entertaining, the media room was a hit for watching movies, there was more than enough seating for my entire big group, and the bathrooms were to die for. The shower is the finest shower I've ever been in, with a rain showerhead, 4 wall-mounted jets shooting water at your chest, a European showerhead and steam jets, plus a nice cedar bench to sit on while washing your feet and being 4x the size of a normal shower. The infinity tub was nearly as nice, especially because you could turn on the bathroom's flat-screen TV to keep you amused in-tub. But what sets the Skylofts apart is the amazing service. They unpack your bags, bring up complimentary non-alcoholic drinks and ice, press your clothes, provide an extra TV for your video game systems, store your leftovers from meals and heat them up and serve them to you on request, have all the on-demand movies you want and also a significant DVD library you can borrow from, and have the best concierge you could ever imagine (got us primo spots at all the nightclubs we wanted - places that were \"sold out\" suddenly found room when the Skylofts concierge called on your behalf) - and thats just the complimentary stuff (and I didn't even mention the complimentary round-trip Maybach - I will never again sit in such a beautiful car). Its worth mentioning that despite all this service, it seldom felt stiff or formal. All it took was hitting the \"do not disturb\" button and the butlers stayed out of this room, and the staff at the desk was warm and friendly without being excessively formal. The lofts ended up being a great venue for our party - while Skylofts policy forbids outside alcohol and food, its fair to say that if you don't flaunt that you are bringing it in you are unlikely to have a problem. It was a wonderful base of operations, the service was impeccable, the common areas were spacious and comfortable, and the sleeping areas were perfect.

Anticipating the stay a month earlier, we proceeded to book the Two-Bedroom loft with our host. We had a pleasant drive from Los Angeles and were extremely surprised to see the Skylofts Entrance, an extreme failure on the part of the MGM Grand. The Skyloft \"Private\" Entrance is merely a sliding door literally two feet from the main entrance. You literally have to drive through the hustle and bustle of the main entrance to get out of the MGM Grand. I wonder who designed this... Anyways, inside the tiny little reception room that is through the sliding doors, a receptionist is sitting at a desk, calling the concierge to escort us to our Skyloft. The Concierge arrives about fifteen minutes later and escorts us through another pair of sliding doors... right into the MGM lobby! What a sight... why did they build the tiny entrance anyways?! You have to walk through the entire lobby to get to the VIP Lounge, where you pass another pair of doors into a \"Private Elevator\" which isn't private at all. The Elevators can also be accessed through a pair of doors from the main elevator areas, which guests staying in the MGM Grand frequently bypass and crowd the elevators with. The Elevator is anything but grand, with the inside in a very poor condition. However, the Skylofts can only be reached using your room key, so there was a bit of security allowed. When we reached the skyloft lobby on the 29th floor, there was a pleasant scent which led to a front desk in which two people were working. We were escorted to Loft 81, our loft, next to which a bellman and butler were waiting for us. The Butler proceeded to give us a tour of the loft. She then left, and we never saw our butler for the remainder of the stay. On the dining table were two glasses with an extremely sweet concoction and a plate of cheap candies, including a bunch of nuts. We were bewildered at the size of the loft at the beginning, which had three living rooms and a game room. We thought that the loft was a waste of space, although probably good for hosting a party. It was difficult to communicate with each other throughout the loft and was very easy to forget things. The Crestron remotes were a bonus until they stopped working and the TV's had to be manually turned on. However, the beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were well appointed. However, beware of the stairs!!!!!! Older travelers and young children probably would not be comfortable in this room because of the very tall staircase. Sometimes we would come back to the room exhausted and proceed upstairs to take a shower, then remembering that we forgot something downstairs, and not even bothering to go down and fetch it. Also, the many rooms downstairs are very small and the hallways narrow. The dining room barely fit the dining room set, and it looked as if though a TV had been removed from one of the cabinets, probably for economical reasons. Anyways, the remote controlled climate and drape system worked fine and the Bang and Olufsen gadgets were nice. However, from a $1000+/night room, you would expect the best technology, but instead, very poor quality Sony Televisions were provided, which constantly were very fuzzed up. One good feature though was that every room had a DVD player. Other nice features were that the non-alcoholic drinks, snacks, and movies were complimentary. Also, internet access was free. I found the steam room quite useful and the tub average, some may appreciate the lights, but I would have preferred a jet tub, instead of a champagne bubble function. They still provide a flower with a quote at turn down service and also provide a glass of voss water beside the bed. However, the overall design and amenities of the Skylofts did not suit us, and we proceeded to move to the Wynn.", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fallon, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cperfection\u201d", "Author": "tanbummz5", "ReviewID": "UR57281948", "Content": "The best place to stay with the best service and great rates!

Skylofts is definitely worth it if you want VIP service at clubs. They do a tremendous job getting you on the lists and table service. Skylofts is a very recognized and big name in Vegas.

The Bellagio is just very very classy and sophisticated. The penthouse is huge with his and her bathrooms and 5 T.V.s throughout. I had a lakeview which was an amazing view of the fountains from the top floor. We ate at Picasso which was amazing, very small portions, but amazing food and a little over $125 each plus the costs of wine or whatever extra.

Skylofts win. Hands down actually. Skylofts really is a superior experience, different than other hotels offer. That is my summary. My long winded version follows: I booked the trip through American Express Platinum Travel, which I became a member of just to use the travel benefits on this very trip. I highly recommend the Platinum service. With it I had expected to get an upgrade from a 1 BR to 2 BR. Unfortunately even though the website showed availability for two 2 BR lofts and two 3 BR lofts on the day of my arrival I was told that none were available for the 3 days of my stay and that a @ BR loft was only available for the first night. Needless to say a was steaming mad. My wife and I traveled with our friends and really needed a 2 BR room. They were very apologetic but not too helpful in getting the situation resolved. I would have hoped that they would have offered a second room/loft at a deep discount but they had no 1 BR lofts available and didn't offer anything at the MGM. They did offer a room at The Signature, no discount. They were really pleasant, apologetic for the website showing availability they didn't have, but not great at making me happy about the solution. I contacted Platinum Travel and got my final 2 nights in a 2 BR Penthouse Suite, they were great and helpful as always. I will post a review the about the Bellagio as well but do my best to compare the two here. Other than the major disappointment about only getting one night there, the Skyloft experience was entirely positive. The 2 BR is huge, over the top huge. It would be outstanding to throw a party in. It is very modern and hip, very tasteful. The condition of the space is great, but I suppose you could look at a painted surface here and there and see a small chip. Only the most obsessive people won't be happy with the condition of the space. Layout was great. We had a foosball table we used until late into the morning (drunk foosball has to be better than drunk pool). The master bedroom is fantastic the master bathroom is simply out-of-this-world. The tub is amazing. The steam shower is quite seriously large enough for 10 people. It must be about 12 by 12 feet. Bigger than my college dorm room. The rain head, wall spray and steam combo is uber-relaxing, I found no need for the spa. My wife loved the spa at MGM by the way, smaller than Bellagio by about 50% but very excellent services/staff. The sound system is awesome as is but is soon to be upgraded to have internet capable multi-function remotes. They give you free movies and internet which is sweet. My buddy played the first 15 seconds of just about every movie including the porn, just to mess with whoever would look at our movie record! It was great listening to my iPhone/iPod throughout the loft. The free non-alcoholic drinks are a huge plus and not to be underappreciated, especially if you are drinking heavily and need to hydrate! Las Vegas tap water stinks BTW, it is undrinkable. The staff at Skylofts are great, anything to please. They really go the extra mile, Now to compare, the Bellagio is definitely the best hotel I have ever stayed at. I say that because the Skylofts isn't like any hotel I ever stayed at prior it is like a new experience. The Bellagio room is very traditional, very old-school. 2 bedrooms at either end of a very large space that includes a small bar, living room and dining area. The central space is about 35-40 feet end to end. Big. The bedrooms on wither end are nice and big. There is a master one one end ad the other bedroom is actually an adjoining 1 bedroom hotel room. The adjoining room doesn't have a steam shower, and the bathroom is not quite as deluxe. This is also similar to the Skylofts in that the non-master bathroom had no steam shower and the shower was smaller. The Bellagio is all marble all the time. Very sweet. Very prim and proper. We had a fountain view and that was essential in my opinion to fully enjoying this room. If you are going to put up this kind of money you deserve to see that awesome fountain show 6-8 times during your stay. We ate at Olives, great meal and wine cellar. The only time I tried the concierge at Bellagio they did drop the ball a bit. I tried to get my complimentary limo back to the airport and the person I talked to didn't seem to think it was included with the suite. They connected me to player services, who weren't all that nice at all. I told them I was looking for my free limo, they said I needed more points ( I had none as we didn;t really gamble there). While waiting on hold with player services, the concierge called back on the other line and said yes we did get a limo to the airport and hooked us up, but the 10--12 minutes with the not-so-nice lady on the other end of the phone was a bit disappointing and unnecessary. I think the Skylofts really hits the spot for 20-40ish crowds who like their space hip/modern/high tech and fun. Bellagio seems to be going for the more reserved crowd of any age, but seems more pitched at the 40-60 year old base. The only way the rooms are similarly priced is to get the Skyloft 2 BR as an upgrade (Hooray Platinum travel) but beware the trap I had with internet availability and real world availability being different. So In my mind Skylofts wins every head to head comparison. Better room, stereo, shower, tub, bar (free stuff always beats expensive minibar), concierge. Bellagio has a better casino but high minumum bets. The pool is nicer but very reserved/quiet. The MGM pool is much more of a party...we saw guys in costumes, a guy in the Borat suspender/thong bathing suit and lots more 76 ounce beers and frozen drinks 3 feet long. If you want a quiet read by the pool the Bellagio is perfect. The Bellago fountain is spectacular, wherever you stay in Vegas go watch a show or two, especially at night. I look forward to another trip to the Skylofts...I may just suck it up and book the 2 BR to make sure I can get it. The upgrade to a 3 BR would be unnecessary but cool.

We stayed on the Mobil 5 Star package and had an amazing time. We had so much scheduled that we probably saved enough on gambling to pay for the splurge. The staff treated us very well. There has been mention of stuffiness but we are very casual, not formal people and the staff was friendly and responded in kind. We were provided with a very detailed itinerary prior to our arrival and everything went without a hitch. We had some concerns about the heat going this time of year but found that between all the extra time spent in the amazing room, all the activities we had planned and all the available restaurants etc. within the MGM, we only went outside once. That trip was to check out the new Encore. We were underwhelmed with it and quickly went back to our retreat at the Skylofts. As the restaurant included in the package was closed for the month, we were allowed to use the credit at any restaurant in the hotel. This turned out very well. We ate at a different excellent restaurant each night and enjoyed them all. The Ka backstage experience and their treatment of us was a blast. We have a great picture of us in an action pose with the man characters of the show. Seats were 6th row center. Amazing. Everyone should take advantage of the chance to visit the Mansion.

I've stayed at the high-end properties in Las Vegas, from the Wynn, to the Bellagio, to the Four Seasons, and would never in my life stay anywhere but the Skylofts if it were up to me. I have now stayed at this property twice, and both stays were amazing. I decided on booking my room through American Express's Platinum Travel service, which partners with the Skylofts as part of their Fine Hotel and Resort program. This entitled me to a 10% discount, room upgrade if available, guaranteed 4PM check-out, complimentary continental breakfast for each day of my staff, and $100 spa credit. The room rate for my booked 1 bedroom loft was under $500 with tax, and I was excited to surprise my partner with our stay at the Skylofts. We drove from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, and arrived at the MGM Grand without problem. Upon entering the property, I gave the Skylofts a call (per their instructions) to ensure someone would be able to meet me at the entrance. Prior to arriving, I had been contacted by the hotel's pre-arrivial coordinator, who helped me book dinner reservations, show reservations, and spa services. She was very helpful, and was definitely able to pull strings that I know I could not have pulled myself. Upon arriving at the Skylofts entrance (the Skylofts has its own private entrance separate from the main MGM Grand entrance), I was met by two staff members, who offered to helped me with my bags. We were escorted through the private Skylofts entrance, past the MGM Grand lobby, into the Skylofts VIP area, and up the private elevators to the MGM Grand's 29th floor. The Skylofts common area is beautifully decorated, very quiet, and makes you feel as if you truly are a VIP. We were taken to our two-bedroom loft (we were upgraded for free because of the American Express booking), which was the most jaw-dropping room I have ever been in. I counted; there were ten plasma televisions, probably eighteen phones throughout the room, and perhaps a half-dozen remote control units that could control the drapery, climate, television,and music. The room was a two-bedroom, two and a half-bath loft, and must have been, roughly 3,000 square feet. Our concierge did the quick paperwork to check us in, and we were given complimentary juices by our butler. Our butler gave us a tour of the room, spent a good 30 minutes showing us every little detail, and had a great sense of humor about everything. Everything in the room was perfect. All the electronics worked, the climate control was prompt, and the concierge was only one button away. I was a little concerned that there was only one button on the phone, but soon realized the concierge could handle everything from room service, to show tickets, to having my car ready. We ordered a quick lunch, which was delivered promptly and was both delicious and very reasonably priced. All the movies, adult films, and internet were free, and we had a great time watching different movies in different rooms (we literally had to call each other a few times because the room was so large). Other nice touches were the amazing steam shower, infinity tub, and \"dream butler\" (along with the room service menu is a menu for different kinds of pillows, which a nice gentleman brought in and let us test for an optimal sleeping experience). I chose a water-filled one, which was incredibly nice. We decided to ask the concierge to get us show tickets to Cirque Du Soleil's Zumanity for that night's performance, and were amazed to find out we were in the 7th row, and our tickets were heavily discounted. Upon returning to the room, we found a nice dessert left for us, and cute little quotes on our bed to inspire the day. Truly, there is nothing I would change about that room. It was amazing. The next morning, we opted to eat breakfast at The Mansion. The Mansion is an invite-only portion of the MGM Grand, with a few dozen villas for the richest of the rich. Other than paying $5,000 a night for a villa through a service like American Express or Virtuoso, The Mansion can only be accessed if you are invited (high roller, celebrity), though the Skylofts gives you access to their Estate Dining Room for breakfast. Our butler escorted us to The Mansion, and we were seated on the patio. There was only one other gentleman eating there, and we were waited on very promptly. The food was DELICIOUS and, quite honestly, still reasonably priced (we ordered a mimosa, orange juice, pancakes, and bagels and lox, and with tip, the total was under $50). The restaurant manager offered to let us walk around The Mansion, which was a nice treat as it is somewhere that most people will never get to see. It truly is beautiful, and reminds me more of a high-end apartment complex than hotel. My friend took advantage of our $100 spa credit, and used it at the MGM Grand Spa. In the meantime, I went back to the room, had a nice chat with my butler, and enjoyed the steam shower. While hanging out in the 29th floor's common area, I saw few other guests come in and out, though I did see a handful of celebrities (the Jonas Brothers, Jennifer Lopez, and a guy I had seen in movies but had no idea who he was). Upon returning to my room, even at this early hour, I found it cleaned and re-stocked with our choice beverages (Voss Water, Dr. Pepper), all of which were free. I was so sad to leave the Skylofts, especially to go to *gasp* the Wynn. The Skylofts handled every request with a smile and success, whereas the Wynn nickle-and-dimed me for anything and everything.

Another man in a suit opens my door, he knows my name and introduces himself and 2 other men take my luggage from the car. We walk into the MGM lobby past the check in lines to the VIP check-in room. But we don't stop there. We walk right through the room, past the \"normal\" VIP's at their private desks and go onto an elevator just for the skylofts. Once up on the top floor we are in yet another lobby with 2 staff at a large desk. We keep walking. They both greet us by name as we pass by. At the end of the hallway I see a woman waiting holding a door open. Of course its my room. We walk right in, so now its me, my wife, the concierege guy who opened the car, two men with our luggage and the door holding woman. Waiting on the dining room table is a portfolio with our room confirmation and a printed itinerary of our dinner plans that i had made in advance and confirmation for VIP seating at a few MGM clubs for the weekend. We sign the paper and most of the staff cordially depart. The door woman now gives a long tour of the two floor hotel room. Tada- you're checked in. That pretty much sums up the over-the-top so incredible its practically invasive level of service at the SkyLofts. Its an incredible property. We only had two complaints 1- the steam shower works so well that the bedroom smells like mold. 2- you MUST use the do-not-disturb signs because the staff comes in SO often you feel like you have houseguests. Staff walked into the bathroom with my wife in the shower. The walked into the living room while i was in the downstairs bathroom. Twice they came in the morning while we were sleeping. Use the do-not-disturb light. Apparently its there for a reason. An example: Your in-room berries are refreshed twice daily. The Lofts dont have their own pool or amenties like The Mansion at MGM but they will allow you to dine at The Mansion if you are a Lofts guest if you ask. We had breakfast there which was sort of neat because most people arent even aware it exists. The lofts are huge and consequently are frequently rented to groups of \"6\" young men for parties. That of course means 32 young men and all the women they could find at the clubs. They aren't loud, but they definately are quiet.

The temperature gauge was useless and 2 of the handles were completely broken off. -4 of us were stuck in the elevator for 5 minutes, continuously ringing the alarm.

After making reservations, I was contacted the next day regarding my pickup information and my personal preferences for soft drinks, coffees, juices or other assistance with dining or show reservations. There was a slight glitch with the pickup service but it was handled very professionally and gracefully. We were picked up in the MGM limo due to other pickups but the Mayback would have been nicer. We were greeted curbside by a Concierge and our personal bellman and shown to the new (since Jan \u201909) Skylobby adjacent to the MGM main lobby area. It is a small registration area staffed with a 24hr Concierge and Ambassador who will arrange for transportation (ie private taxi line). I think after a few complaints the MGM built the separate Skylobby to compete with the exclusive hotels-within-hotels trend. I appreciate that alot: a hotel that listens. Prior to the Skylobby, guests of the Skylofts had to wait in the same lines as guests of the MGM for taxis. Not exactly optimal if you\u2019re paying upwards of $500/night. We were whisked through the VIP Lounge to the private elevators of the Skylofts. Already waiting for us outside our Loft was our Butler and Bellman with our luggage in tow. \u201cSign here,\u201d and our keys were handed to us. My favorite drink, watermelon juice, was waiting for us on the dining table as well as an icy Dr Pepper for my partner. I actually think they remembered how much I loved watermelon juice from my previous stay. Amazing. We were shown the multitude of gadgets and endless features of the Loft: Jura Espresso Machine, Kohler Infinity Edge Bubble Jet tub, Sony TV, B & O sound systems, and Crestron Controls for lighting, drapes, climate, and electronics. Then you are left in peace so you can, as another reviewer stated, to pick your jaw up from the floor. There are endless rooms that continue to go on and on.

Our turndown service was beyond slippers beside the bed and chocolate on the pillows. Our toiletries we brought with us were laid out neatly on the vanity, my toothbrush was tucked into its own linen napkin, the clothes strewn across the chaise were neatly hung in the closet, shoes laid out in a perfect row, the Kleenexes were embossed with the Skylofts logo, and our sunglasses placed on yet another linen napkin.

Only at the Skylofts can you wake up to breakfast waiting at your in suite dining table and the Butler (yes I said Butler) is making your Latte. The Butler is not your full-time private butler it is one of a pool assigned to the Skyloft suites. Therefor should you want him/her in suite making your latte at 8am promptly you need to make your request in advance. That being said if you decide at 8am that you want a latte it's pretty safe to assume the butler will be there making it within 5 minutes of calling the concierge. Anytime you walk through the Skylofts lobby any employee sitting will stand and greet you and any employee standing will move aside greet you and humbly wait for you to walk by. With one exception, one of the staff will race to the elevator to press the call button for you, pretty easy to get accustomed to.

The two bedroom suite was so large (3000 square feet) that we rarely even ventured into the other side. So by now you're asking why does the title of my review say \"Almost Perfect\" Here's why, a few of my small request did not happen immediately and I had to reiterate my request.

So after staying on the north end of the strip for three nights at the Encore in the Tower suite section we then headed down to the Skylofts for 2 more nights. Firstly all our bookings were done direct with the hotel well in advance of our trip from Australia. We received excellent service from Valerie, the event concierge service that is on offer once you make a booking. Valerie assisted us with all of our bookings for restaurants, activities and show (L'atelier, The Mansion) plus multiple services at the day spa for my wife and golf for myself at Shadow Creek.. Best person we dealt with for our stay, everything was spot on as requested. The services from all of these areas mentioned above was excellent. Best golf course I have played on anywhere in the world to date and my caddy Ryan was excellent. Ok it did cost me US$650 including tips for the round that included private maybach car transfers, club hire, buggy and drinks but hey you only turn 40 once. Great memories and played good golf which added to the day. Now as for our stay we left with mixed feelings mainly to do with the staff rather than the ammenities on offer. Yes the rooms are very nice and large mezzanine style apartments with high end finishes and great views etc. The previous reviews have mentioned all of the gadgets and tvs, baths, automated accessories etc. So no issues here - very nice set up and the space is great even when you have come from a bigger than normal hotel suite. The room in places was however a little worn, the limestone flooring was chipped and discoloured in places, the timber boards of the landing on the stairs warped and split, the carpet, walkways and lounge suite also showed signs of guest wear and tear. The decor is nothing offensive nor cutting edge however the 2 storey window view of the strip etc was incredible. The decorated cake, box of chocolates and fresh juice on arrival was a very personal touch for our stay. The steam room shower was excellent although the negative egde spa looks great is was not comfortable nor was the bubble pattern adjustable to a more vigorous setting. Imagine sitting in a half flat bottle of soft drink, yes you know there are bubbles but they aren't really doing much to your senses. The Bvlgari bath products provided were exquisite. During our stay we needed some laundry done as we were short of clothes due to the warm Las Vegas weather and the disgusting smell of cigarette smoke throughout the various casinos. So we had our butler organise this for us. Should have known better and this proved not a wise move - $160 just for the washing plus butler tip on top as well. Our small amount of washing was beautifully clean and individually folded and wrapped. So what about the staff you ask? Check in was fine the Maybach driver collected us from Encore and we were handed over to a concierge person, then a check in counter person then on to our room butler, plus a visit from the bag person as well. Of course other than the reservation attendants everyone else stands around waiting for tips. So you tip and go with the flow. 2. Housekeeping comes twice a day and take an eternity to do their thing, mind you there are two of them working the room and of course they make sure they come and say hello and collect their tip. OK I know in the US tipping is the norm but at some point the fee you pay to stay in a hotel should be sufficient for staff to be paid a decent income for their employment) in this instance where is my $900 p/n going if the cleaners are both standing there waiting for a tip?) don't forget the tip for the ice delivery, the room service,( even though they already add gratuity + a service fee to the bill), room butler, car driver the list never ends, oh and the butler to escort you to breakfast at the Mansion. You cannot move about the place without someone wanting to \"latch\" on and do this or do that. I appreciate its a fine line between service and over servicing guests, but after a while it does get annoying as we felt there was no privacy in or out of the room. We might as well have had a revolving door for the myriad of staff who come and go as they please. If guests want assistance they will ask and no doubt the Skylofts staff will deliver, but, otherwise give guests the privacy they deserve! On the second night, turn down service took 20 minutes and a third person / manager was in attendance the whole time as well. My pet hate throughout our stay was the continuously ignored privacy sign on the door. Staff would ring the door bell then proceed to opening the door and entering the room. I spoke with the concierge / service desk to ask them for privacy and even this failed. I went to golf and my wife wanted a spa bath so I politely asked them not to have anyone enter the room. No problem I was assured, so 15 minutes after me leaving, my wife answered the phone from the spa only to find a man from housekeeping at the door wanting to come into the room to store our laundry. Hell does anyone here understand what Do Not Disturb means? (PS there is a huge glass panel between the bath and the stairwell so there is certainly no privacy from unwanted guests or hotel staff.). 3. Everytime we left our room or came out of the lifts and passed the service staff desk they all stood up to attention. A very nice gesture but totally unwarranted and despite our requests for them not to stand up they continued this throughout our stay. Look we are just normal people trying to enjoy our time away. Skylofts may have a high end hotel but not all guests want to overtly flash there wealth position or act like pretentious wannabes or upper crusted higher than thou types who demand everything and anything. Some people just like to be humble and private rather than in your face. Skylofts obviously has fewer guests in the humble category and more of the demanding style clientele as they are well geared for this latter style customer. As a side note Skylofts hotel area is in the top 2 floors of the MGM Grand. It is very private and quiet unlike the general MGM casino below it. At the time of our stay it was coming up to memorial weekend as well as a big fight night in their show room so the general casino area was very busy. The casino was filled with people from all walks of life as well as the smoke from the millions of cigarattes they bring with them. The general casino is dated and and we felt sorry for the staff working in these conditions and with the numerous intoxicated and obnoxious patrons they are forced to deal with. Now as a Skylofts guest you need to go through the general hotel lift well area to get to the designated Skylofts lifts door. To do this you must work your way through the crowded waiting masses who think you are trying to push in for a limited spot in their lift. So you are in fact running the gauntlet of the gatherings of loud and intoxicated masses - not an experience for the faint hearted. It was an indifferent experience at Skylofts, brilliant in so many areas but then mixed with some basic areas, along with some instances that were either lacking or just down right annoying. Not sure we would rush back to Skylofts or the MGM Grand. Thanks to those staff that did listen and help us during our stay.", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "basel", "Title": "\u201cThe Ultimate Indulgence\u201d", "Author": "ericlaudia", "ReviewID": "UR30979926", "Content": "Spent 7 nights with my fiancee in the Skylofts, nothing was left to be desired, from the VIP Check-In to the Maybach transfers..

Depending on how you look at it, you can really get your money's worth out of this place. I think the lowest rates they do are at around $500 a night. Expensive - yes. But I go to Vegas a lot and just wanted a place at the MGM to chill in out without the rest of the sightseeing marathon. But for $500 you get an AMAZING 2 floor penthouse, roundtrip limo or Maybach transfers, free gym access (they have a small gym up there or you can use the main MGM gym), all the free soft drinks/water/coffee/tea you can guzzle, free internet, free in room movies (including the adult stuff.....), enough Bulgari bath products to last you a life time. There's probably a lot more stuff that you get included. I stay at the Wynn/Encore a lot where in just a regular sized room they charge you at least $8 for water, $15 per day for internet, $13 per movie, $30 for use of the gym - and if you want a car to pick you up at the airport, its gonna cost. You do the math on how much extra you spend for an average sized hotel room elsewhere. I can't imagine there are many other hotels as good as this in America - and if they are, they're not going to be anywhere near as good value for money. Yes, $500 is a lot per night. But there is a lot of value in it for a high end experience. Stay here at least once and don't leave for the entire trip. Also make sure you get breakfast at The Mansion. Unless you're a serious high-roller, there's no other way to get into that place. And it is stunning. Staff can be a little over bearing though.

I chose to stay at the Skylofts because the photos online and the amenities included with your stay (Maybach limo transport). I am an extremely picky traveler who expects alot depending upon my purpose of travel. Since I was celebrating my birthday I had specific requests so that I would enjoy myself. Seven of my closest friends were flying in so the Skyloft concierge team had to plan out a small dinner party for seven and limo pickups and nightclub VIP seatings etc. From the very beginning the hotel did not miss a beat. The customer service was absolutely outstanding. When I got to the airport there was a young lady waiting at the gate to greet me. We arrive at the hotel in an MGM grand limo that was refreshed with Fiji bottled water. Upon arrival we had the no waiting approach we accessed a private elevator right to the room I was staying in. When I got to the room the check in process began. The room is supplied with butlers and maids round the clock. The butler gave us a tour, and the room was more than I expected. Extremely contemporary and very sexy. This was the first time Ive seen a shower with see through walls so others in the room could see you take your shower. There is an ipod hookup on the main level to which you can control your ipod via remote. And the music can be heard (surround sound speakers in every room) throughout the loft, very sexy. This is not mention in advertisment. The butler set up for my party and the table was georgous. the food was outstanding!!! Compliments to the chef. My Bday cake was a beautifully decorated chocolate that was magnificent. Overall the room was spotless (that means no dust and no scuff marks on the floor or walls and of course general cleanliness beds and baths)!!! The fridge come fully stocked with complimentary beverages (incl Voss water-sparkling and still). I could go on.... But I can not do my experience justice....check out the hidden gem on the roof of the MGM Grand Hotel for yourself you won't regret it! some concerns: At check two of my friends were there she could have been more decrete about how much the room cost etc. and the maids and butler have access all day so you never really know when they will enter the loft.

I had read quite a few reviews prior to booking and was still blown away by the magnificent level of service that they extend to all their guests. After booking online, I received an email from Valerie who thanked us for booking and invited me to call or email for restaurant reservations, show tickets etc. I called Valerie and requested restaurant bookings both at the MGM hotel (Craftsteak = Delicious) and at other restaurants where I did not believe that they took reservations. Guess they do for the skylofts as our 7:30pm table was ready & waiting. Wanted to see Kai (great show btw if you have seen O) and got preferred seating. I also requested a strip view room & received it despite arriving 5 hours earlier than the 3pm check in time. On arrival at the airport, we were greeted at the gate by a lovely skyloft Representative who escorted us to the luggage carousal. We were taken outside and the renowned Maybach62 pulled up to the delight of my two daughters who did not know where we were staying in Vegas. On arrival at the MGM, the concierge & bellman were waiting. We were escorted passed the check in desks, through a VIP room to the two separate elevators. Up on the 29th floor, they have two desks with people to assist you with any reservations you may have forgotten to pre arrange. The lobby do have drinks served during certain times but we did not indulge during our stay. We were escorted down the hallway and could see Art, the butler, standing at the door of the loft. Check-in is in the room at the dining room table while the bellman takes your bags upstairs to the bedroom and you sip your welcome juice. I had a two bedroom suite which I booked based on previous reviewers and was so very glad I spend the extra amount as the master bathroom is to die for. After check in Art showed us around the loft which has all the latest electronics which work at a touch of button along with drapes, climate & lights. Loved the day, night & mood lighting around the loft. Ladies, if you normally take an hour to get ready to go out, expect to take two hours when you stay in the skylofts. The large shower doubles as a steam room with bench. I put cleanser on my face and did a steam for 30mins. Don't do that as I got a rash. The infinity tub has the lights & champagne bubbles and faces the flat screen tv. The tv in the mirror is fun. The gown and slippers are comfy. The heated towel rack another great addition as is the walk in closet. The Bvlgari body wash, shampoo & conditioner are another treat. The upstairs bedrooms are large with wonderful bedding and soft beds. Downstairs, we had two lounges, a media room with card table & dining room. Turn down service is the best I have ever encountered anywhere. The rooms are cleaned and used items replaced. They even arranged all my cosmetics in the bathroom on white cloths with product names facing up & in order of use. Cool bottled water next to the bed and a small gift + flower on the bed with a card. After leaving the \"do not disturb\" on until noon, we switched to make up room and by the time we walked to the end of the hallway, someone was waiting from housekeeping to refresh our room. Complimentary water, soda's, newspapers, internet & inroom movies. You can also request a laptop, video games & DVD's. In Room breakfast was served by Art and was hot & delicious. You have to request toast as it is not on the inroom dining card. Requested and received a later check out until 3pm. Check out was quick as was the transfer to the waiting Maybach62. The skylofts charm is in the staff. The courteous, charming interaction with everyone was much appreciated. Many reviewers have remarked on the tipping. I did tip but never felt that anyone was waiting for it. Keep checking the mgm skylofts website calendar to see when the prices suit you and treat yourself and love ones to the best hotel in Vegas.

They have someone waiting right outside the airport gate to greet you and escort you to your private limo. The limo then drives you directly to the MGM Grand where you are greeted by your personal concierge. She then takes you to the private elevators that go to the 29th floor where all the Skylofts are. Check in is done in the privacy of your loft where you are greeted by your personal butler that takes care of your every whim, including unpacking your bags (although I chose to do this myself, we did take advantage of the pressing services). The butler immediately stocked the fridge with the beverages of our choice, showed us how to work the espresso machine and gave us a full tour of the loft and how the remote system works. Everything in the loft is controlled by remote - lights, tv, radio, climate and drapes. The butler checks on you 4 times a day and is available by phone whenever you need anything. The housekeeping staff keeps your bathroom stocked with the basic Bvlgari amenities and anything else you could possibly need (toothbrush, razor, shaving gel, after shave, cologne, mouthwash, everything). The first night I was there I developed a blister on my foot from my new shoes. The housekeeping staff rushed two Band-Aids up to the loft. The docking station wasn\u2019t accepting our ipod, so 2 IT guys were there within minutes to diagnose and fix the issue. I couldn\u2019t figure out how to get hot water out of the espresso machine to make tea, the butler was there in a flash to save the day! The concierge coordinated all the services including all reservations and help from the other staff members. When we asked concierge how to get to Craftsteak where we had dinner reservations, they wouldn\u2019t think of giving us directions. Instead, they escorted us to the restaurant and explained our tardiness to the hostess where we were immediately seated with a smile. We understand that the night before, the Obama\u2019s and Clintons dined there. We ordered from their summer menu which included wonderful selections that gave you a taste of the chefs favorite items, including deep sea scallops, saut\u00e9ed shitake mushrooms, kobe steak, quail etc.) We had so much food left over, we asked if it would be at all possible to box it up. We were told that the butler would take care of everything. The next day we called the butler for our leftovers and he heated the food and brought it to our loft, set it up on our dining table and it was more than enough for the both of us. We saw a super fun show called Crazy Horse Paris. It\u2019s based on the original Crazy Horse in Paris and is a burlesque type of show with wonderfully ballet trained dancers. Very entertaining. On our final day, we decided to eat breakfast at the mansion. These are the rooms that start at $5000 a night and are reserved solely for the high rollers and celebrities. The mansion restaurant is reserved solely for the residents of the mansion but privileges are given to Skyloft residents as well, but you have to be escorted by your butler. We made 8:30 reservations, sat on the patio overlooking the beautiful courtyard and we dined alone as no one else was in the restaurant but us. The patio is enclosed by a dome and is temperature controlled to 70 degrees.

I don't drink so to me its the difference in policy. They still leave a little something at night though. There is a subtle difference and not for the better. I do believe its because of the drop in price. 1 bedroom going for $500 per and 2 bedroom starting at $700. When you start to see things like this the quality goes down. The rooms are getting worn and dirty. Most of these dirty areas are the couch areas in the den area of the suite. I get the 2 bedroom for the bathrooms. The tubs are great but are not working at full strength. The first 2 visits I dealt with my Butler on everything in the room but not this time. I saw him 1 time at the first meeting and gave him $100 and didn't see him again. The room service was done by a regular server you get in any room. The dishes were picked up only after a call was made. I don't like having a butler up my butt but this 3rd time I did see the difference he makes. I always came back to a clean room and he made sure things got done. This time I had to make calls. I gave out over $1000 in tips durring my first day from the car service to maids so it wasn't from a lack of tipping. Actually everyone always stopped us to talk.

We stayed for 5 nights and we never saw the same staff member twice. That goes for maids butlers and concierge. The hotel also needs it's own exclusive pool as the MGM pools are terribly overrun with children. The complimentary entry to the Wet Republic ultra pool was great but this is not a very relaxing space with the crowds and the loud music. The general MGM pools were over crowded and noisy. At least the guests staying at the signature properties had their own exclusive pools. Alas no such luck for a relaxing quiet swim while staying at the Skylofts. The room was great. Loved all of the televisions and the overfowing baths and the B & O sound system and the ipod dock and the central remote controls. The bed and linen were great.

When the private elevator arrives at the top floor and you are escorted past the AAA Five Diamond award plaque only then do you realize that it seems every employee in the building has been informed of your \"arrival.\" The Skylofts is absolutely, positively over the top, and why not...It's VEGAS! I was fortunate enough to stay in a 2-bedroom loft during my stay. When I say loft I mean 3000 square feet of the most extravagant, state of the art living known anywhere. If modern is your thing I have not seen a hotel that comes close to this place at any price. The room itself is worth the price of admission, the personal service puts it over the top. From the moment you are picked up in the Maybach limo you start to realize what is to come. Ask the driver to demonstrate how the glass roof magically changes from frosted to transparent, very cool. Pulling into the sea of people and vehicles at the front entrance of the MGM, everything seems to yield to you. A side entrance to a private elevator and a quick ride up to the top floor wisks you from the fast action of the casino floor to the tranquil serenity of the Skylofts commons. A short walk follows to your room where your butler awaits and you are presented with your check-in documents, sitting at your dining room table with a welcome beverage and fresh fruit. I would highly recommend taking the butler's offer of a tour and demonstration of the technology and features of the room. Don't let the formal appearance of the staff intimidate you. They are very friendly and understanding to guests such as myself that aren't accustomed to this amount of pampering. Don't hesitate to ask questions, they will do whatever is possible to satisfy your request and make you feel comfortable. When I inquired about possibly eating at Craftsteak that night, I was met with a reservation at the time I requested. What I wasn't prepared for was the very large table in the center of the restaurant that had the appearance it was reserved for special guests. Coincidence? Probably not. Some previous guests complain about the Skylofts being located in the MGM. I disagree, I say take it for all it has to offer. Have the concierge arrange the best seats in the house to KA, eat dinner at the restaurant of your choice. It's all just a short walk. Once you tire of the action downstairs, a quick elevator ride transports you back to your room and the world away from reality. Tips for the first stay at Skylofts: - Don't forget your iPod. The room has a docking station/charger that integrates all your songs, controllable through the remote controls, to all the speakers in the room. When I say speakers, I mean the most crystal clear Bang & Olufsen speakers I've ever heard. - Attend the cocktail hour in the commons area. Apparently most of the celebrities staying at the MGM choose to stay in the Skylofts. You never know who you might bump into. - Order room service. The prices are reasonable. When I requested breakfast at 7:30, there literally was a knock at the door at 7:30, not a second before or after. Not sure how they managed to be exactly in sync with the watch on my wrist, but I wouldn't be surprised... The first thing I do now when planning a trip to town is check room rates at the Skylofts, it really is that good!", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, KY", "Title": "\u201cVery impressive\u201d", "Author": "kyverdicts", "ReviewID": "UR15041631", "Content": "Spent four days here with my daughters, age 5 and 4. We had a two-bedroom suite. Had a pool table. The kitchen is nice, but no sink. Kim the butler organized a bottle of bourbon and wine. Brought Shirley Temples one night. The technology in the room is overwhelming, but it is really fascinating. Takes a day or two to get it squared away, but once you've got the hang of it, it's a piece of cake. Wife plugged in her IPOD downstairs and controlled it upstairs and it played throughout. Free movies are cool -- kids watched some and we watched I Am Legend on hangover night. [Porno is free too so even if it isn't your thing, it's LV and it's free!] The room will not disappoint. Being at Skylofts may be the best part. Dinner at Picasso. Had the best seat in the house, literally in front of the fountain at Bellagio. Tickets for 4 to Mystere at TI -- fourth row, center. Out with the wife to TABU. Ben, our host, set us up with everything. Came back the next night and he gave us a table (gratis) and a drink. What I'm getting at, it isn't just the Skylofts themselves, but being in the Skylofts. You've got access to the best of everything. That's hard to quantify. But you aren't slugging it out with the rest of the schmos. You go to the front and have the best seat, just because you're Skylofts. The only drawback really is that you are at the MGM Grand, which is okay, but certainly not in the class of the LV's nicest hotels. But with children, while the Rainforest Cafe is all kitsch, they loved that and the lions. The pool too is excellent for children. Rented a cabana for three days and while not cheap, $200 each day, ($400 on Friday when Bon Jovi was there), it's good. [Saw Tom Jones in the Skylofts lobby -- all the stars playing MGM Grand are at Skylofts.] I think I'd do it again. Nightly rate $1,000, but spent double that with babysitters, drinks, dinner and so on. When making a concierge request, don't make it early in the morning or very late at night -- those are the overnight guys and they don't know anything and aren't that helpful. Hit the day staff who are much more professional. Problems at Skylofts? I'm broke and it's time to pay my taxes, but more importantly, was it worth it?

On the third morning we headed to another Vegas hotel (Hard Rock) known for it's pool area. Unfortunately when we arrived we were informed that the pool was closed for renovations. We immediately checked out and called our Skylofts concigere. Unfortunately Skylofts was sold out but offered to put us up at their Signature property that night and then back into a Skylofts suite for our final night. The Signature was great but we could not wait to get back to our Skylofts experience.. Everything you will read in the other reviews is true. They are really great rooms. They are even a great value. Compare the prices to a suite at the Four seasons, Wynn, Trump, or the Hard Rock. We live in a high tech loft that I designed in Chicago and were still blown away by the skylofts vibe. Our only knock was on their pool area. My last visits to Vegas included stays at the Hard Rock and Four Seasons. Both have much nicer pool areas. Skylofts shares their pool area with the MGM hotel. It is designed with a 1970's country club feel and is not up to par for a high end boutique hotel. The good news is that they have built a new facility! We were told that it will be restricted to Skylofts customers, Suites at the MGM and space available paying customers. You can see some photos of this new pool area above. Our understanding is that the space is set to open this summer. It will put them back over the top and be on par to the Hard Rock Rehab RX party area! If you are on the fence about booking a room at this hotel I'd highly recomend it for the privacy, security, and ambiance. It is a great experience. The service is flawless. Be prepared to tip...often! As a bonus, how often will you get the chance to ride in a chaufeur driven Maybach? One final tip. If you have an early check in or late check out due to flights I would encourage you to book the private spa room. It offers two showers, a tub, exercise bikes, and a massage table and will allow you to freshen up prior to or after a flight. I believe that the charge was $50 per hour and we found it quite refreshing. It was very private and luxurious final touch to our stay after being by the pool all afternoon.

It is in the top floor of MGM and has its own reception area and conceirge where all your needs are taken care of. Stand-by limousine service is at your disposal anytime of the day. Free limousine pick-up within entire Las Vegad is also available. The reception area could book you to almost anything - concerts, shows, restaurants. Staying in Skyloft also gives you VIP treatment in MGM and all MGM group of Hotels. You just show your room key and anyone from MGM group will be glad to assit your needs, eventhough you are in Bellagio, you will be given VIP treatment. The suite is perfect. It is equip with the best equipments you could possibly imagine. From the most expensive sound system, tv and even coffee maker. The pantry and the bar is free and could be refilled many times as you want by just asking the reception. There's a exclusive elevator for Skyloft guests.

We've stayed at the Four Seasons, Bellagio, Venetian, Wynn and THEHotel, and the Skylofts blow each one of those out of the water. We stayed in a a 1 bedroom Skyloft before Christmas, and it was simply amazing. It starts out with getting picked up in a Maybach. That's probably the nicest car in the world, arguably nicer than the Rolls-Royce Phantom, which we also took from another hotel. The ride is only 10 minutes, but it sets the tone for the rest of your stay. Once you arrive at the MGM, your concierge will be waiting for you downstairs in the driveway. You are then personally escorted through the MGM lobby, into the VIP area, and then into private elevators just for Skylofts guests and VIPs. The Skylofts are on the Penthouse floors of the MGM. Why I say \"floors\" is because each Skyloft is a duplex! Our 1 bedroom was already huge at 1,500 square feet, but because the living room ceiling is basically two floors, the whole feeling is like an atrium, which makes the room feel even bigger. I'm talking about a 30 foot high glass window overlooking the Strip. Ridiculous. In the room there are too many amenities to mention. B&O plasma and sound system controlled by a Crestron remote that controls EVERYTHING. Bring your iPod since there is an iPod dock on one of the walls which allows the Crestron remote to read off all your songs and play your iPod through the B&O system! This remote also controls all the lighting and even two sets of blinds/curtains for the living room window. There's a Crestron remote in the upstairs living room too that has all these functions. Besides the B&O plasma, there are a total of 5 flatscreen TVs in the room. Yes, that many. A HDTV LCD in the bedroom, another one downstairs in the 6 seat dining room, and two in the upstairs bathroom, by the bath and IN THE MIRROR. Not only that, but besides having hundreds of channels including HD, ALL PAY-PER-VIEW MOVIES ARE FREE! Yes, even adult movies...everything. Also free are snacks and non-alcoholic drinks. Yes, everything except the alcohol in the mini-bar are complimentary. This includes the espresso/cappuccino machine in which there are 4 types of coffee beans in jars for your choosing, all free, which are ground up fresh in the coffee machine and made all with the touch of a button. That's not all - the shower, which is bigger than most hotel bathrooms, is also a steam room! Yes, no joke, it's like your own personal sauna with a seat as well. What's more, there is a glass wall in the shower which looks into the staircase of the loft, and then onto the Vegas strip! Yes, you can have an amazing view of the strip while you are taking your shower. Ridiculous. There's also a huge long walk-in closet that could probably fit in your entire wardrobe from home, and then some. The bed itself is amazing, as I remember, Frette linens and one of the softest hotel mattresses I have ever slept on. But besides the amazing room, what really sets Skylofts apart is the concierge. You would not be getting the full Skylofts experience if you don't utilize the concierge. By this, I mean they can get you anything. Last-minute restaurant reservations, awesome seats at any show, and VIP passes to any club. We partied up bigtime due to it being so hassle-free with the concierge at your fingertips. If we didn't have that, there's no way we could have just walked into all those clubs with lines, or gotten amazing seats to sold-out shows. Especially if the show is in one of the MGM-Mirage hotels, which seems to be half the strip nowadays. Despite me starting out this review by saying Skylofts is second only to the the fantasy bungalows and villas like the Mansion at MGM, our concierge told us that the week before our stay, the biggest celebrities in the world including Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie attending the Mayweather-Hatton fight all choose to stay at the Skylofts over the Mansion, as did both Hatton and Mayweather. So that tells you something. If you are interested in seeing what the Mansion is all about, Skylofts residents can have their breakfast at the Mansion dining room. We did this one morning - very expensive, but worth it! We were the only ones in the room and the breakfast was phenomenal! However, the decor is much more traditional luxury style, which is why younger folks and celebrities might prefer the Skylofts, which is very modern and very chic. If you can afford it, definitely make your next Vegas stay at the Skylofts. It's living about as large as you can in Vegas, and don't forget to hit up the Skylofts concierge to set up everything for you, including shows, restaurants and clubs.", "Date": "January 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "north yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cThe most amazing place to stay\u201d", "Author": "wayfarer240", "ReviewID": "UR11981408", "Content": "We stayed at the MGM for nine nights, seven nights in the tower rooms and two nights in the sky loft.

Prices fluctuate wildly depending on when you book, I paid $790 a night - that's about \u00a3400 with the current exchange rate. I have seen rooms listed for as little as $510. Now that is just plain crazy. For that price you would need committing to the nut house not to take advantage. Everything about the experience was just great. From the collection by the Maybach to the whole check-in experience it's like experiencing how the other half live and I like it a lot. Nothing is too much trouble, and little things like the desk staff standing when you walk through the loft lobby to hotel staff stopping and standing to the side in the corridors while you pass.
