The hotel was working on renovations during our stay. At times we felt that we may have been the only guests in the hotel, we didnt see anyone else the first day. The staff working when we checked in was friendly and carried my bags to our room. He did not speek english and told us, so that we didnt attempt to ask him questions that he didnt understand. The front desk staff gave us a map and told us where to get on and off to see all of the attractions. The staff told us how to buy train tickets and wrote down the names of the stops that we should get off at. This hotel is near the tube and the line that runs from here goes near all of the paris attractions. This hotel is not near the main train station Nord. Our room had a nice view of a court yard. The tub is quite small and the shower is a bit low. My husband is over 6 ft tall and needed to almost kneel in the tub to shower. The room is very clean and the bed was very comfortable. There is a cafe at the end of the block, a p\u00e2tisserie a block away and a lovely grocery shop a black away. The tube is a black away and the hotel is situated on a lovely and quiet street. Staff are friendly and are helpful with reservations, taxi's and info. Note: If you call a taxi you pay a reservation fee, if you just go to the street and hail a taxi you save 15 euros. This is a lovely hotel on a quiet street. The only reason I dont give them 5 stars is because they worked on renovations early in the morning. We also had to be very careful not to touch the walls or the rail on the stairs cause the paint was wet and the floors were covered in drop cloths.

The single rooms are cosy (definitely large enough for one person), modern (most have been recently renovated we were told) and comfortable. The hotel is not located on a main road so all was fairly quiet at night. Also, the hotel is located close to two metro stops (Chateau de Vincennes and Berault) on Line 1, which takes you directly to stops in the center of Paris such as the Louvre, Rue de Rivoli, Etoile,etc. Although some people do not like small hotels such as this in which the rooms are so close to one another that you can hear everything that goes on outside your room, if this does not bother you, I highly recommend this hotel.

The lobby is a spacious, comfortable place to read a newspaper and sip coffee while waiting for the rain to stop.
