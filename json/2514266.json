I dont think I have stayed anywhere as bad in my whole life and I have done some amount of travelling. Where to begin?!! Firstly we couldnt check in until 3pm, so we left our bags in there and had arranged to meet a member of staff at 3pm to get checked in etc. We waited in the rain and nobody showed up until 4pm. No apology, no excuse, nothing at all. We then went into the room, it was FILTHY, the bed hadnt been cleaned in ages and there was an awful smell.. We were given the bed sheets etc and did the beds ourselves. No toliet paper, no soap, and we were only given one small handtowl between my partner and I for 4 nights stay. Discracful. There was no reception desk there so we could not get any help from them at all. The room was so dirty and was very noisy (Being literally right beside Oxford Street) The only reason we booked this accomodation was that everywhere else was booked out for new years and it was the cheapest out of them all.. I would recommend anyone ever thinking of staying in this place, not to- its awful, it really is a filthy hotel", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDO NOT BOOK HERE\u201d", "Author": "Nichola W", "ReviewID": "UR120415798", "Content": "- Telephone number given online did not work - Nobody available at the hotel when we arrived, despite a scruffy note on the door saying reception would be open - Shoddy, messy, dirty front of hotel (little door) - Rude staff over the phone once contact made, little English spoken - Charged more than the full nights stay even though we had to find another hotel!!

But at least, no wall-to-wall carpets and, as far as we could tell, clean sheats & no bugs. The location is great and the area safe, so we kind of took the filth with humour. Upon arrival, we had a thorough do-it-yourself cleaning session with the help of antibacterial wipes (cost us 10 minutes and two pounds for 2 packs of wipes). OK, the blackened chewing gum on the floor remained there and I therefore left my socks on most of the time. The shower curtain was indeed moldy, but the water hot. The toilet seemed ok clean, we nevertheless gave it an antibacterial swipe, too. The staff was ok & mostly friendly and since we arrived in the afternoon, we did not have any problem with the check-in. Good and affordable breakfast is served just across the little (car-free) square and Bond street underground at two minutes walking distance. Overall: The Ivanhoe is cheap and a bit strange, but we spent the money we saved on shopping & good food in town. I hope they soon get a grip or sell the place to someone else, because you actually could turn this into a pearl. Although it turned out to be an enjoyable London weekend for us, we will certainly look for another place to sleep the next time around.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFilthiest hotel we have ever seen!\u201d", "Author": "mikenovacane", "ReviewID": "UR118388719", "Content": "The only decent thing about this rat hole is that it's location is fantastic. 1 block from Oxford Street and all the shopping.

The bed had been made up, but we weren't sure if it was fresh sheets, so we didnt even get under the blankets for fear of finding filth, and ended up using towels for blankets. (in addition, we had to go ask for towels and toilet paper because there were neither when we got into the room) The bathroom has mould everywhere and hair all over the floor and walls from previous vistors aswell.

I would usually stay at the Ivanhoe, and found it basic, but clean, neat and friendly and very inexpensive (around 67 pounds a night, incl tax and cont. breakfast). The people who worked there and managed the place were very pleasant to deal with. The location is terrific, as there are lots of restaurants and shopping nearby, and I didn't have to be frightened to be alone. There was a middle eastern restaurant with great food downstairs that sayed open pretty late, and I liked to go there too. So, Frommers used to be right. It was a find. I was so dissappointed when about three years ago, I brought my family with me to stay there for two nights. The place had been sold to new owners, who have no idea what even \"basic\" service is. Piles of old laundry were on all of the narrow stair landings. (there is no elevator; imagine navigating your suitcase around these piles) They didn't service the rooms at all while we were there. When we arrived, there was only one towel for all four of us. I had to go searching through their hall closets in search of more towels or clean linens. When we were checking out, the desk guy was very slow because he was engrossed in some LOUD horrid TV show starring a very fowl mouthed, large breasted, drunken, rude American woman -- a TV show he had playing in their very small first floor landing \"lobby\". I've read the other reviews and can imagine that if the current management kept up the same dismal service we experienced on our last visit to the Ivanhoe, then it is likely that they have let the hotel get run down and even become full of fleas.

After being left there to wait for the manager who took 15 minutes to arrive we were then escorted to our room. The room looked like it was maybe cleaned 2 a week and the bathroom was cramped and getting the shower to work took no less than a miracle.
