We were really satisfied with the hotel. As we were so many persons, we could see several types of rooms, the double, the triple and the quadrouple, and found all of them comfortable and clean. The only small inconvenience was, that the street in front of the hotel is very noisy also during the night, you have to close the windows tightly for the night to sleep well. The hotel offered a simple but nice breakfast with fresh bakeries. The location of the hotel is ideal, you can stroll along the Seine to reach Notre Dame in 20 minutes or take the metro at Gare de Lyon which is in front of the hotel to anywhere in Paris, including the surroundings. ( The RER to Disneyland starts from Gare de Lyon) .

Shower was compact but powerful and sparkling white. TV had a small range of channels in English, two of which were news channels. In the morning breakfast was rather good with some croissants (plain or chocolate), ham, cheese, hard boiled eggs and some fruit. Coffee was served in medium sized coffee pots and tasted delicious. The staff were friendly and helpful at every point and were able to advice on various travel points. Having an internet centre was a bonus, as for once I didn\u2019t have my laptop.

When it was almost time for breakfast to be finished my wife was still upstairs. I asked if I could take her up some coffee and a wonderful gentlemen said, \"I will take a tray up to the room\" Wow! Also, I accidently left out on the bathroom counter in our room a considerable amount of money in a money pouch.

We arrived in Paris at the Gare de Montparnasse station and took the #91 bus across town to Gare de Lyon. We also suggest taking bus #87 from the train station to the Eiffel Tower and Bus 63 and 69 to see various sites. The metro is also a good way to get around, but I enjoy taking a bus so I can enjoy the city sites in route. There was also a bus from Gare de Lyon to the Gare d'Est station for a day trip to Reims. The room may lack romantic French charm, but was clean and comfortable. We stayed in a room with a balcony overlooking the train station and were not bothered by the street noise.

I chose this hotel due to positive reviews and excellent transportation links. It is worth checking the hotel website as I found a better deal on it than travel sites which included breakfast. Front desk personnel were really friendly and helpful. Our check in was a breeze. We were greeted right away as the hotel was expecting our arrival around a certain time. I didn't even have to sign in. Logis Terminus is very European in nature. It is a smaller hotel. Our room was a bit small but was fine for 2 with a desk and a couple chairs. It was very clean, well kept and updated. The elevator was small and barely had room for 2 with suitcases which added to the character. Breakfast was very good. We were served a basket of fresh delicious croissants and breads with little jars of jam and choice of tea or coffee. There was a small buffet which had good quality ham, cheese, yogurt, fruit and juice. We used the metro, Gare de Lyon, which is basically across the street to get around the city. It is really easy and efficient. The Gare de Lyon also has many trains. L' Open tour (hop on/off tour bus) is just around the corner on Lyon. The hotel gave us a voucher coupon for a 2 day pass which costs the same as a one day. We used this to see all the main tourist sights. (The orange line wasn't operation but this was no big deal.) We also caught the train out to Versailles from Gare d' Austerlitz which is an easy 10 minute walk. I would really recommend seeing the Chateau Versailles. It is amazing! We also took the metro one evening to see the Eiffel tower. This was again spectacular to see at night. The Parc Zoologique is an easy 10 minute walk as well. It is a really nice area to walk around and enjoy the outdoors. There are also several restaurants, pharmacies and a couple grocery stores very close by to purchase bottled water, fruit, wine, etc. The hotel emailed us directions from the airport when arriving by using the train from CDG. It was quite easy. Upon returning to CDG we took the Air France bus which was only a block away and much quicker. I would recommend using this service both ways even though it is more expensive. We had no complaints with the hotel. I would really recommend this hotel if you are looking for a good place to stay with great transportation links.

Breakfast (included in room rate) is typical continental with some cold cereals, cheese, meat, yogurt, coffee or tea, croissants, rolls, etc. That it opens at 5:30 a.m. is an added plus since I had to catch an early plane. The room rate was reasonalbe for this type of hotel and for this city. There is a computer with free internet access right off the eating area. The location is excellent.

Also, a number of bus lines in the area will take one to different parts of the city too. There are a good number of restaurants in the area. good bakerie and some shops and stores.

This hotel is across the street from the Gare de Lyon rail (SNCF)/suburban rail (RER)/metro station, so you can get to CDG airport with one RER change. Metro line 1 will take you to the Louvre, Opera Bastille, the Grand Palais and L'etoile, it is very frequent and very fast, and it crosses most other lines.
