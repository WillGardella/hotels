Hotel was spotless. Upon check-in you receive a welcome glass of champagne, or if you do not drink you are offered a glass of juice. Our room was large and the beds were comfortable. Lots of pillows. The only thing that was missing was a hair dryer. A hotel of this quality and no hair dryer was disappointing. Every staff member made a effort to smile and acknowledge us in some manner during our stay. The breakfast was delicious. The breakfast buffet was $20. per person. However when the bill was presented we were only charged $31. total for 2 people. The server said we did not eat that much. We do not eat large breakfast's but we did eat plenty. All the meals were pricey but not out of line with other hotels of this quality. There are no restaurants within walking distance so unless you drive or take a taxi, the hotel is the only resource for meals. The burgers in the little hut by the pool are excellent, and it is a fun place just to hangout. If you are going to Sea World which is across the street, there are many choices of places to have a meal. Sea World is across the street but a great distance to walk to get to the main gate. The meals in there are just as pricey. The hotel offers a shuttle to all the theme parks. The shuttle runs on a schedule. There is a complimentary bus that goes to Busch Gardens but you must board it at Double Tree Hotel which is located behind the hotel but not close enough to walk. The hotel offered us a ride to the Double Tree but getting back to our hotel cost us $10.00 which is what Double Tree charged us plus tip.

As pass holders for Sea World, we would see the hotel from the parking lot and mention that one day we would be there. We used Priceline and got a great deal. Our room, was standard King room, and was a very nice size; and we had a great view of the pool and courtyard. When we checked in, we were given a glass of champagne, which was perfect as my wife and I were there for our anniversary. The staff bent over backwards to make us feel welcome. Due to an allergy, we needed the room to be feather free. I had told them in advance, but I think they gave us a different room then they had planned. I called the front desk and within 10 minutes, someone was there to change out the pillows. My wife and I went then went out to dinner, and when we got back, the staff had taken out the down comforter and replaced that with a non feather one as well. The price for parking was a little steep, but we were told of the parking fee ahead of time; but the hotel is literally across the parking lot for Sea World, so it is in walking distance, and they don't want people parking there, trying to avoid paying to park at Sea World. There was a small issue regarding inappropriate (or lack of) attire from a guest that we observed in the hot tub, I informed security and they took care of it right away. I can't rate the food as we didn't eat at the hotel. The property itself is beautiful, and they have daily activities for kids, to give the adults a break. The pool is one of the largest I have seen at a hotel, and there are two hot tubs. This truly was a great experience, as the concierge was helpful in suggesting some local places to eat...I hope to one day return for another weekend stay.

I am Gold member through Marriott & have stayed at many chains. The most notable was the customer service. I had booked my hotel using my United air miles. All was good and had the confirmation # from both the 3rd party company booking the reservation and then got my reservation/confirmation through Marriott. Upon arrival/check-in, they could not find my reservation. After some research, they found out that the 3rd party company cancelled my reservation. I never got an email and they claim they don't have history of it. We know the 3rd party company dropped the ball because I had the Marriott confirmation #. Anyhow, during this process the employees at the front desk were very friendly, always keeping me confident, and happy. One employee, I believe her name was Fernada, eventually was the one to get me checked in. There was a computer glitch that she had to follow up later to fix and she did. There was also a discount that she allowed me to use even though you can use it booking online. She went out of the way to make sure I got a room and didn't have to worry about anything so I can enjoy my vacation with my family. They even offered by champagne a couple times during the process :). The reason we chose that place because it was right next to SeaWorld. We just walked over to the park.

There is a slide and the pool is only 12 inches deep at its deepest level. There's another part of the water park that's separated but right across the floor there and it's got two larger slides.

We loved almost everything about this hotel and were bummed when we had to leave (aftern 7 nights) to complete our vacation at the Rosen Shingle Creek. Check in was a breeze, but we weren't offered the champagne/juice others were being given. I think it was only for Marriott Platinum members, but it was not nice that we saw others receiving it and were not offered any. Room was great: we were given a huge king with an equally huge balcony. Bathroom was standard but did have double sinks (time saver when my daughter and I need to brush at the same time). Why are hotel sinks so incredibly high? I had to tiptoe and we had to get a stool for my daughter to reach it. With so many kids staying here, each room should have one. Housekeeping was fine. We tipped every day, but didn't feel that it enhanced the service. Pool and kid's waterpark: AWESOME and the best part of the hotel experience. We spent days lounging by the pool just hanging out. Food: Starbucks on site was fantastic. I did get attitude a couple of times though. Mostly I was just glad that it was there and I could have my machiatto every day, twice a day as I'm used to. Good for snacks too, and the most reasonable food in the hotel. Tradewinds food was ok. Crab cake app was very good, but skip the spinach/artichoke dip. Yuck. This hotel had a kids menu where everything (burger, grilled cheese, chicken fingers, etc) was $6. That was a great bargain! We did the breakfast buffet one day and did not feel it was anywhere near worth the $40 we spent (one adult, one child). There is a Denny's literally up the road that is a much better deal for breakfast. Pool food was fine, not too terribly overpriced. Kids menu available there too and that helped bring down the price a lot. We usually spent $35-40 for a drink, a salad and kids meal at the pool. Not cheap, but if no kids menu, bills would be 50-60% higher. Don't get the \"drink special of the day\" drinks they have by the pool. They're priced HIGHER than the drinks on the regular menu and you only know this after you've gotten the bill. Pool special drinks are usually half price or 2 for 1 at most hotels. The computers in the business center are super slow and you will spend a fortune if you try to get anything done on them. I had to cut my losses one day and drive to the nearby (about 2 miles) UPS store to use the computers there. Half hour is $5. At the hotel, half hour would cost you $12 and you would need at least double the amount of time because of the slowness. Hotel is beautiful and has a very sleek vibe. There is a sushi bar in the lobby, but we didn't try it. Self parking is a breeze as the lot is very close to the hotel and there are several entrances. Self was $16 plus tax and valet $21 plus tax. Pretty much all the large hotels charge the same parking fees, so there's no getting around that. The Renaissance saves you money on parking at Seaworld though as it is literally across the street. Ticket prices for Seaworld are cheaper online than at the hotel. If you have to pay to use the computer, forget it and get tickets at the concierge desk. Nearby restaurants we tried were: Red Lobster - prob a little better than what you'd expect Thai Thani - ok, not great thai food Ming Court - nice venue, maybe getting a bit worn, but food not very good. shrimp was not cleaned, but they did take it off our bill Ciao Italia (near Delmonico's on I-drive) - excellent and the best food we had during the entire 11 days. try the superb lobster ravioli.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Visalia, California", "Title": "\u201cGREAT place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "Ddt1979", "ReviewID": "UR128007124", "Content": "Everything was clean, modern and enjoyable.

When we arrived at check-in we were greeted by John at the front desk. He was very nice and accomodating. He poured champagne for me and sparkling cider for my 5 year old daughter. He recognized my husband was a platinum rewards member and I inquired to whether we could get a suite. To my delight, a suite was avaialble later that day which we didn't mind waiting for. We were on the 10th floor in a beautiful king room corner suite and it made our 8 nights there very memorable (thanks John). Bear in mind, while writing this review, I'm aware that suites have been uprgraded with newer face lift while some of the standard rooms are still in the process of being renovated from what I hear. But, if you have a suite - you should be in good shape. (very nice decor and colors and we had a great view!) The pool was fantastic - but will say, food service at pool hit or miss! I didn't worry about it too much as most of the time I was enjoying the beautiful pool and new waterpark area with my family. The first day we had lunch at Tradewinds. We had a nice waiter, but didn't get the right dressing with my salad and it didn't have croutons on it as mentioned on the menu - the food was fair. At the end of our meal though, the waiter gave our daughter a really cute shamu stuffed animal and a coloring book - so made up for the salad error. We did go back for dinner one night and had a pretty good dinner - and Easter brunch was great! They had omelets made to order, kids pancake station, and tons of fresh fruit on the bar. This was the highlight of the food for this restaurant. Scale of 1-10 for tradwinds 7-8, but overall fine. easter brunch a 9! The maid service was hit or miss! One day, we came back to our room and the maid had made our room so nice, even organizing all of my daughters stuffed animals on the bed - it was super cute - I even took a photo - for the most part maid service was fine - but there were times in which we noticed mirrors not being properly cleaned or full towels not always restocked. Again, some nights exceptional, some just fine. We loved our suite and the large refrigerator it had - good for morning snacks, water, and other beverages. We also had turn down service and chocolates - but noticed it was not on all of the nights just a few - did enjoy the nights in which they came in with those chocolates though! The bellman at the hotel were very nice and accomodating. Also, another very nice touch was we were not sure if our regerator was working, so put in a service request. The maintenance person left a note with a chocolate saying hoped everything was working properly - thought this was Excellent for customer service. Also, the hotel organized a really nice Easter Egg hunt for the kids. Only problem big kids got the eggs too quickly - maybe next year -organize by age group - just a suggestion? There weren't enough eggs for eveyone to find. Other idea is to communicate to kids - no more then 3 eggs per kid so enough to go around. But, it was a lovely event and nice for the hotel to do - at the end they found a box of additional eggs to give to the kids who didn't find them - so that was good. It is disappointing to have to pay to park but knew that anyways when booking - no biggie. Keep in mind - you can walk to Seaworld - so you don't have to pay for parking there if you plan to go there at least one day. Plus, the resort gave us free quick queue for SeaWorld - that well made up for the parking costs. _ get them from concierge day before or early morning before they run out. This would have costs $19.99 each if you bought at the door - and we got for free. This allowed us to bypass people in line. For the one ride, Journey to Atlantis there was a 60 minute wait, but in the quick queue line - no wait at all - we enjoyed riding it with my daughter four times in a row and never had to wait. All and all we had a great experience at the hotel! Everyone was very friendly at the front desk area and accomodating. It also helped that we got lucky to score a great room that led to a memorable and relaxing family vacation. Give it a 9 on scale of 1-10. If food at tradewinds better and pool bar service better - would have been a 10. But, already recommending this hotels to others especially if they are going to seaworld.

Room was great we are silver status Mariott members so we got a room facing with large picture window of the grounds and pool below. (It really pays to join hotel or car rental orgs-it has a few perks and it is all for free). Large King size bed and pull out couch and chair. Huge counter in bathroom double sinks etc. Other rooms look out into the giant courtyard that are filled with couches and 'east indian' designed sitting areas with cushions and hanging curtains as well as huge TV's everywhere with images of sealife swimming around. In the bathroom you get a small squizzable shamu whale sitting on the tub so I quickly phoned down to the front desk to ask for another for my grandsons and was immediately given another! Had a bit of a problem with the TV so someone came promptly to fix as while he was in the room attending to the TV the front desk called twice to make sure he came and the work was done!!! BRAVO. Suggest some cabinets added to huge bathroom counter underneath to store items especially if you were staying longer. Didn't find coffe machine until we were leaving as it was stored in closet-please place on your lovely coffee table it will fit nicely and people will see it for sure. Food court area in the lobby (didn't try restaurant) had great food and service. Gift shops are super great esp for kids with a candy store inside. Full size Starbucks on main floor as well, spa and lovely grounds and pool area with kids waterpark on site. Trolley bus runs by hotel, SeaWorld across the street, and Aquatica 2 walking blocks away.

Fantastic pool and waterslide area for the kids and pool is open until midnight which is very nice! Friendly Staff. Starbucks on site is convenient. Welcome drink and water in the lobby. Clean rooms. Cons Tradewinds restaurant is way overpriced for the food it serves. Dinner food was okay, but bill was $70 for one adult and two kids (with only one alcoholic beverage). Breakfast was $15 for 2 eggs, bacon, homefries and toast \u2013 that is insane so of course we did not eat there for breakfast. A child\u2019s pop at the pool is $3 \u2013 for a fountain drink. Wayyyy over priced! $16 a night for parking seems a little steep (glad I got the hotel cheaper) $10 a night for access to internet is just crazy. Even the best western gives it to you for free. Mehs The uniforms on the front desk staff are awful to the point of embarrassing for them \u2013 they do not even fit them! The rooms and bathroom could use a little facelift. They do not have any brochures anywhere, you have to ask at the front desk for them. They were serving someone else so I had to wait a little over 5 minutes just for a brochure. All in all a good 4 star hotel. I would stay there again just because of the pool.

One error I saw was that there is not a separate \"adult pool\". There is a kiddies pool with slide, but children are allowed in the main pool and along the deck. Caution -- the deck gets very slippery when wet especially if you are wearing flip-flops. A few things to add. We made the reservation last minute due to a bad experience at our hotel in Lakeland and decided to check out of there a day early and be closer to the airport for our departure. Yes this hotel is a major conference facility (three ballrooms) but the only time we saw attendees were at the pool after 5:00 in the bar. Never felt they were in the way. Since I am a Marriott Elite member we were given complimentary champagne upon arrival. Our room was nice with a \"view of SeaWorld\" (which was really of Seaworld's parking lot). I was a bit peeved that we had to pay $16 for self-park (the same price as valet). You would think the parking would be a lot cheaper than that. There is a bus that stops (called the I-stop red and green line) right outside of the hotel and runs along International Blvd to all of the major restaurants and shopping. We laid out at the pool and the Bartender was very friendly. Drinks were a bit pricey ($9 for a frozen margarita) but probably because we are at a resort. The Bartender recommended the hotel restaurant for dinner. We went to Tradewinds and had excellent service and one of the best meals of our whole Florida trip! The hostess almost sat us next to a large family group of 15 with several squirmy children (we had seen them at the pool) but she quickly moved us to a quieter corner when we protested. The extra towels I had ordered through marriott. com were not in the room when we checked in but they quickly arrived with a phone call to housekeeping. My husband liked the gym except that a thicker floor mat was needed to do push-ups. The hotel accomodated our request for a noon checkout rather than a 11:00 a.m. checkout. While the room did have refrigerator it was very noisy and you could hear the compressor running from inside of the cabinet. And the bathtub shower head was a bit short for my 5\"11\" husband. All of these negative comments are nit picky -- we really did have a great time and we were very happy that we had changed our reservation and were only 10 miles from the airport.

Location: Situated on Sea Harbor Drive, one block off International Drive, the hub of access to most things going on in Orlando. 5 minutes walk from SeaWorld; directly opposite. The Hotel: 7oo (ish) rooms is built in a hollow square format on 10 floors with a huge glass roof forming an atrium over the interior. The hotel is bright, clean and welcoming. Rooms: These are large, well appointed and well furnished, choice of two Queen beds or a super king, large well appointed bathroom et al. Excellent rooms with good facilities incl safe, refrigerator etc. Eating and Drinking: There is a sushi bar and restaurant, not tested. A US type sports bar and restaurant at which we ate twice. First experience was good. Second experience was very poor, due to a conference in the hotel (these are on an everyday basis almost). The place was obviously under pressure, our food took an hour to arrive, was cold and poorly presented. The waiter was embarrassed and replaced the food but we were still charged the full amount. There is also a restaurant called HBs. We ate breakfast here twice. Full buffet breakfast hot and continental choice costs $21 plus tax, continental only $16 plus tax. We tried both. The continental is better value with a good array of fruit, breads, pastries et al plus unlimited coffee and OJ. Service was excellent both times.There is a Starbucks inside the hotel which is very good for a quick snack and excellent coffee. Facilities: The hotel has an adult pool and an excellent children's pool with mini flumes. Whilst we were there the pool area was heavily used by conference guests, many of whom were dressed and lying on the pool beds between meetings we presumed. Car parking is good and plentiful and situated close to the hotel. The concierge service is outstanding, extremely knowledgeable and courteous staff who are very helpful in arranging park tickets, quick queue entrance to rides at al. They even produced us an email map for the 2nd part of our holiday south to Naples.We never tried the spa.There are ice machine stations on all floors. The hotel runs a free courtesy bus to SeaWorld (not really needed) and to Universal Studios. The Staff: As previously intimated the staff at this hotel are unfailingly polite, friendly, helpful and welcoming.We felt we were valued as guests and we loved the way all staff went out of their way to ensure we had all we needed. Minus Points: Not much to gripe about really, the maid service in the rooms was a bit hit and miss at times and the presence of large contingents of conference guests could deter some people but the hotel is there to make money.

The lobby area is classy - with the marine theme, a nice gift shop, well-appointed bar area, Starbucks & business center - and makes a good first impression. Also, the valet and reception staff greeted us by name and demonstrated excellent customer service in every way. The complimentary glass of champagne was a nice touch. The room was very large & clean, and the Aveda bathroom products were appreciated. The pool and water play areas for the kids were a big part of our enjoyment, and although we were there for 2 days primarily for a visit to Disney, my daughter asked to spend the whole first day in the pool area. It was relaxing & enjoyable. I have three suggestions that would make it an experience that is more consistent with this quality category. 1: The service in the pool area could be better. Having experienced similar setups at other hotels, I found that although poolside refreshment service was offered, it was inferior to that of other similar hotels. It was somewhat challenging to flag someone down & get a menu, and the follow-up once it was delivered was almost non-existent. Also, we initially set up in the children's water play area, and no service was offered there. It could be that we started there before they started providing poolside service (I read somewhere later that that service starts at 11 a.m.), or maybe they don't send servers to that area at all, I don't know. Either way, parents in that area need that service most of all! Those in the main pool area without kids typically have the freedom to get up & order at the poolside cafe, whereas parents watching children in the kids area would have to drag their kids away from their play, requiring quite a bit of effort in some cases, to get some food at the cafe. In any case, poolside service should start before 11 in my opinion. They post rules that say you may not bring your own drinks/coolers/snacks into the pool area - that opens early in the morning - and then they don't make drinks & snacks accessible? Not good. 2. The beds were very comfortable, but the bedding did not fit the beds, and the sheets were thin & not very high quality. The fitted/bottom sheets did not fit over the bottoms of the mattresses, which gave it a cheap appearance and also meant they did not stay in place very well, especially on the kids' bed. I would have expected better in this price category. 3. Have a lazy river. It would be the perfect finishing touch to what is otherwise an very nice pool area. There are a number of hotels in the area that are similar enough that would have an edge because they have the lazy river. None of the above areas for improvement would keep me from going back, although I might gravitate toward the lazy river at the Hilton on International or the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cPleasure & Business Trip\u201d", "Author": "bannertraveler", "ReviewID": "UR125983021", "Content": "The Renaissance Seaworld was a very nice hotel and in an excellent location, directly across from Seaworld.

Here's the good and bad: The good: You can't beat this location if you're visiting Sea World. It's the closest hotel by far and we made the easy walk there even though the hotel offers bus transportation right to the front gate. Nice touch to have the hotel offer champagne and sparkling cider at checkin. It was so nice to just walk back to the hotel after our SW visit; other hotels are available fairly nearby but a much longer walk especially when traveling with a six year old. Renaissance Sea World is a comfortable, modern hotel with impressive architecture. It's like a gigantic box facing Sea World with the walls of the box consisting of rooms, the floor of the box is the lobby, restaurants, and ballrooms; and the rest of the box is open air with large lattice structures holding up a huge skylight. The hotel staff was very friendly throughout our visit. Our room was spacious and the bathroom had luxurious marble tile floors and very large double sink countertops. The outdoor pool is massive, the hot tub large and refreshing, and the kids water park is one of the best I've seen anywhere. Our daughter wants to go back to this hotel for this feature alone, as she spent a good two hours there. The bad: We booked this hotel based on our status as Sea World annual passholders attending the 'Bands Brew and BBQ' event at SW. We selected the Renaissance knowing it was a premium priced hotel with advertised benefits and a great location. The hotel's website advertises that for the BBBQ event, annual passholders are entitled to a special room rate (which we received), a free breakfast for kids, and free self parking. There are also other amenities available to SW annual passholders year-long that we didn't know about at booking, including free 'Quick Que' passes. At checkin, we got the special event passholder rate per our reservation, but were told the free self parking was for Sea World - meaning if we drove across the street to the Sea World parking lot we could park free, which we could do as annual passholders anyway, but when we drove back to the hotel for the night we would still have to pay the hotel's self parking rate of $17/night. We never heard anything about the advertised free kids breakfast or other available Sea World passholder benefits like Quick Que. In our room, which was on the top floor near the elevator, there was a consistent clack-clack-clack noise that I assume was related to the operation of the nearby elevator. It was noticeable as soon as we checked in, and while not ridiculously loud and probably not avoidable, it was an unwelcome disruption especially as we were trying to sleep. Our room had some nice features but others that need upgrading for a premium hotel - flatscreens are small, room has double vs. queen beds, and there is evident wear and tear. The verdict: This is a very nice hotel that has an unbeatable location if you are going to Sea World. It's a premium priced hotel and has great amenities, but make sure you understand (and get) all the things you should be getting.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cantonment, Florida", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Resort/Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Lauren M", "ReviewID": "UR124898129", "Content": "This Marriott-owned resort was awesome- from the rooms, to dining experience, and customer service.

We really weren't expecting too much as far as hotels go, but we thought that with the Renaissance we were sure to get a standard level of comfort and service. Firstly, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who has a problem with heights. The atrium with the hotel rooms on all four sides gives the impression of being in a high ceilinged industrial warehouse. The massive space gives the hotel a deserted look. The ambience is cold and there's a mish mash of of interior decoration that does nothing to help that. Cool, strangely shaped rattan lounge sofas are strategically positioned in the atrium but ruined by a terrible blue/green/orange carpet that the hotel should have done away with in the 90s. Other beach/lounge chairs give the whole thing a confused look. The sushi bar is modern but we gave it a skip because the fish didn't look fresh that evening. The best place for a drink and a bite to eat would be the hotel's sports bar, which is warm and inviting. The pool area is beautiful and it's a real shame that the rest of the hotel does not have the same standard. We found our room - which had two queen beds - disappointing. Although spacious, the room is furnished poorly. - The fridge droned so loudly, we had to unplug it from the socket. - There was no minibar. - The coffee/tea machine was stored in the closet and from the calcified look it had and the dust it had gathered, it obviously hadn't been cleaned for some time. - The hair dryer was likewise full of white dust/mould and a long strand of someone's dead hair was still on it (and I have the pictures to prove it). Also, the length of the cord meant you had to stand right by the bathroom door when using the hair dryer otherwise you would pull it out of the socket. - There was a wet, used face flannel hanging on the back of the shower head. - The chair by the office table was dusty and hadn't been cleaned either. - Wi-Fi in the room cost $14.95 for the first 24 hours and self parking now costs $16. - I believe someone already mentioned the Fedex Business Center. For a hotel of Renaissance's stature I would expect a decent internet connection if my credit card is being charged by the minute to use your business center computers. I felt frustrated and embarrassed for the hotel. - I must say, the thing that we found most unacceptable was the behaviour of some of the front desk staff. It's highly uprofessional behaviour to gossip about your guests (regardless of what they look like, where they're from, who they're with or any other factor) particularly when they are in full view of you and can see you doing it! The only good thing I can say about this hotel is that there was a highly competent, polite staffer (Australian/ Canadian?) working at the sports bar who made at least that bit of our stay enjoyable and the ladies who worked at the inhouse Starbucks were a pleasure too.

First of all, when I reserved online, I specifically requested and was confirmed for a single king-size bed, but when I arrived, I was told that all of those rooms were taken and I was given two queen beds. The hotel is big, and the rooms are laid out in a rectangle around a large interior courtyard. There are only two elevator banks, in the middle on opposite sides of the large sides of the rectangle, so it's almost always going to be a long walk to your room. There are outside rooms, which have a view of little more than the Sea World parking lot, and inside rooms, whose glass doors open out onto the interior courtyard. But they are also visible from the hallways that surround the courtyard, so you must keep your drapes drawn or people will see in. This is really bad when you wake up, because you can't get any light in the room until you're dressed. (Rooms are dark, with low-wattage light bulbs.) After several days, the effect was claustrophobic, never seeing the outside world until we went outside the hotel. The courtyard has what looks like a huge fish tank, but it's just apparently a model. There are no fish, nor even water. There are several large TV screens showing video of fish. There are a couple of bars, but they are overpriced, the bar where where we drank was not well-stocked and the bartender made weak drinks poorly. The outdoor swimming pool has a bar, but it was even less well-stocked, and the bartender had never even heard of drinks or brands we were asking for. Plus it closed at 6 p.m. Also, the bathrooms are big, with double sinks, but there is no shaving/makeup mirror. The wide countertops are a bit away from the mirrors, so if you are nearsighted, it's hard to see while you're shaving or applying makeup. Not a dealbreaker, but worth noting. Cable TV pixilated or blacked out regularly. There is a FedEx business center, but it closes at 5 p.m. and is closed on weekends, when our business conference was scheduled, so you can't, for instance, ship heavy business materials back home. The hotel wasn't totally terrible - the staff was helpful and nice, and the restaurant was decent. We got a special room rate for the conference, but the posted rate in the room was $459.

If you drive your options are limited as there is no street parking. So factor in this cost when staying here. The pool area was superb. Two large hot tubs. Lots of seating possibilities including a large day-bed type of affair which invites napping. The woman in charge of the pool area was very helpful. Food at the pool restaurant also very good. Two criticisms: 1) Avoid a room at the back of the hotel near the large AC units. They cycle on and off all night and for light sleepers they can be troublesome.

When you are gone for an entire week, sometimes the hotel lifestyle can wear you out. This was more like being in a home with a plethora of entertainment right outside the door. We had several instances that we needed interaction with staff and found them to be friendly and quick to respond. The television reception in our suite was bad. The tech team was there within 5 minutes of our call. He made several attempts to correct it inside the building but found it necessary to go outside and work with the dish. He gave us a free movie in the other room for the inconvenience which made my sick daughter very happy. This gesture was something so simple but greatly appreciated. Our housekeeper worked quickly around us when we found ourselves in our room for the day with a sick child. She was sweet and changed out all of the linens in both rooms after we informed her of the illness. We didn't ask her to... she did it of her own accord. We had connecting rooms - a king room (very roomy with an awesome balcony overlooking the pool and firepits) and a king suite (beautifully appointed in peacock colors with wonderful furnishings including a sectional with pull-out). Our room was right next one of the elevators which we never heard. (I will add that this elevator closed at 9pm each night which may have helped the noise potential) This is a true resort with several places to eat, a couple of lounge areas, a full-service spa on the second floor and amazing grounds topped off with one of the best pool areas I have seen. There is a top notch water park for kids in the pool area. I have never seen one of this size at a resort outside of the Caribbean. The pool area is full of hammocks, beach beds and clam shell chairs. Awesome poolside bar! Finally... the location. It can't be beat! This resort is directly across the street from Sea World.

We were given a card saying we had 10 % off at the sushi restaurant. We went to the restaurant at 830 and it was closed! Eventually after speaking to 4 people we were told it had closed as they had only made $50 that night! We were offered an extra 10% off at the bar and had to have a bar snack of deep fried chicken wings or some such - not exactly 5* sushi! The room was a shock! An ugly view of something industrial looking & a loud annoying air-conditioning unit. The room was so dusty I started sneezing! I tried to phone to get it cleaned or to change but the phone didn't work. I then asked a man at one of the desks for an ATM he shrugged & said he was new & didn't know. I asked another person for details of Discovery Cove (part of Seaworld) & was told she didn't know as the hotel had nothing tO do with them. We got up early and left and although no-one had told us we knew we were entitled to fast passes for seaworld so got some. We didn't try out anything else so maybe other things in the hotel are OK. I won't be trying it out again. It was cheaper than the Club Level at Hard Rock but both are 5 star but I think they are like different planets! The Renaissance was a complete let down!

Hotel lobby is quite grand and beautiful - the aquatic theme used throughout is great. Front desk staff offered me a glass of champagne and worked with me to find a nice room as I am Marriott Platinum. I was offered a \"Parlor Suite,\" which I was told was newly renovated. The one caveat with this room is that it is equipped with a Murphy Bed (the kind that can \"tuck away\" into a wall), so it's not your typical Marriott/Renaissance signature feather-topped bed. Not too bad, though, as the room was HUGE (at least 600 sq ft), and was equipped with a dining room table for 6, a large sectional couch, double vanity in the bathroom, and brand-new, very contemporary furnishings and decor. The large flat-screen TV was nice, too. I enjoyed the Aveda toiletries and the room was relatively quiet, except for when the neighboring room's kids decided to run up and down the halls every morning around 7 am. I enjoyed the lobby bar, but didn't frequent the hotel's two restaurants as I felt they were very overpriced. The fitness room was PHENOMENAL and one of the best I've ever experienced - tons of machines, free weights, kettle bells, yoga mats, exercise balls, bosu balls, and more. New-in-bag headphones also provided for workouts. The pool and grounds of this hotel are immaculate and I enjoyed some pool side lounging. I wish it had been warm enough to swim in the pool as it looked very nice. Parking was easy, although it cost $16/day. Access to area shopping and restaurants is easy via rental car or a tram (ask at the front desk). Note to Marriott Gold and Platinum members: as this is a Renaissance Resort property, there is neither a Concierge Lounge nor is there a daily breakfast buffet voucher. Therefore, they give you a 500-point bonus instead (this is on top of whatever Welcome Amenity you select if you are a Platinum member).", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Providence, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cGreat Property, Great Price!!!\u201d", "Author": "Lisa V", "ReviewID": "UR121922954", "Content": "We just got back from 4 days at this Hotel and couldn't have been happier!

At checkin there was a very nice man to check us in. Seeing that the hotel was empty I thought I would ask for an upgrade, he said he could upgrade for 40.00 more and I told him I was looking for free and said no thanks. We had a complimentay glass of Champagne which was a treat! The room was nice and it made my day to see the little whale sitting on the tub!! We were hungry and wanted to experience the hotel ambiance so we were going to eat in the Tradewinds restaurant. We went to be seated and the man at the front said they were closing and we were told to go to the Boardwalk. We went to the Boardwalk and we ordered chicken wings to share with our drinks. There wasn't much of a choice on the menu so we thought we would eat outside the hotel later. The chicken wings were undercooked and we had to send them back. The drinks were way over priced at 12.00 for a Rum Runner & 9.00 for a Mai tai. I think the alcohol was a little skimpy because I had 2 Rum Runners and did not taste the alcohol. The Rum Runners were good otherwise. The wings were taken off our bill but we ended up paying a bill of 47.93. There are so many good restaurants outside the hotel whuch would have been a better choice. Starbucks for breakfast the next morning was a real treat! I did not like the idea of paying 16.00 to self park. I do not understand parking fees at hotels!! I enjoyed the beautiful hotel atrium with beautiful Christmas trees and lights.

So naturally, while arranging our next Orlando holiday, we booked to come here again. This time we had brought my brother, my nephew (16yo) and my sister-in-law; it was their very first time to Florida so we were keen to show them our favourite haunts. Well, the Renaissance did not disappoint - it was just as fantastic as our previous stay. Needing three rooms, plus the use of a wheelchair, plus disabled facilities and plus lots of other extra requests, we must have been quite a difficult family group to accommodate. However, the hotel came up trumps and all of our requests and extras were provided, and provided with charm and friendliness. We ate at the Tradewinds a three times during our stay and always found it a good experience and the food delicious. As for the buffet breakfasts, well they were two years ago, and still are, absolutely terrific. Seeing my nephew discover the pancakes with all the toppings was incredible! Lunch at Palms was also excellent. Oh, and Mike was still there. It was great to see him and chat with him again. We all had a thoroughly enjoyable stay at the Renaissance - we enjoyed the ambience, the friendliness, the casual easyness of the place. Should anyone ask us, we would certainly recommend they stay at the Renaissance at SeaWorld. Thank you!

These are two bottles of Evian that are placed in the rooms for convienience I guess. I am not sure if they just charge everybody for them or the maid keeps track of who drinks them but we didn't and we were charged. I called the front desk to inform them that we didn't drink the water and to please remove the charges. The person I spoke to said they would remove them. When I got to the front desk to pay the bill, the charges were still on the bill and had to ask to have them removed again. The woman I spoke to asked me if I drank the water in a snooty tone.

Overall, we were satisfied by the hotel. However, we were expecting more for our money, but this Renaissance didn't live up to those expectations. The Good The hotel is well maintained and is in a great location; right across the street from Sea World and only a 10-15 minute stroll down to Aquatica. It is right at the end of the International Drive strip with all the necessary places to eat, drink and shop for kitschy souvenirs. The property has a fantastic pool with a large, separate mini water park for kids. There is a Starbucks on site along with a sushi bar, full restaurant and a bar and grill-type eatery. We didn't try the sushi bar, but the other two eateries and the Starbucks were top-notch. The room was spacious and clean and looked well maintained. The beds were comfy and the room had the usual amenities (TV, desk, etc). The bathroom was also quite roomy with two sinks and full size tub. And even though we were just down from the elevator, the noise from them didn't filter into our room. Noise from adjoining rooms was non-existent. The staff were friendly and very helpful when we needed answers about the hotel and local areas. The maids were excellent and kept our room spotless. They even took the time to arrange our daughters stuff animals in fun scenes when they made the beds. The Bad The hotel has a huge convention business due to the many \"ballrooms\" on site. In our five days there, one conference ended, one ran its course and another was just starting. The first one had an older, professional crowd and blended into the rest of the guests. The second one, however, was made up of college-age young adults who were quite noisy late into the evenings. The hotel staff didn't make any effort to keep them quiet either. For some reason, the water in the hotel stank. Not just smelled funny. It smelled bad. Sort of like a burnt asphalt smell. We didn't particularly like bathing in it, but it didn't leave any residual smell. The rooms are set-up for wifi and ethernet internet access...for $14.95 per day. I still have a hard time understanding why hotels that charge this much for a room insist on charging for internet access when even the cheapest independent flea-bags in town have free internet. The hotel does offer free wifi in the lobby, but this was so slow and prone to drop-outs that it was totally unusable. And speaking of extra costs, the $16 per day for on-site parking is a bit ridiculous. I understand the need to keep people from using it as an alternate Sea World lot or to sneak into the excellent pool, but charging your own guests just smacks of outright greed. The only alternative is valet parking at $21 per day. Choosing this option just gets you the service to the door. The cars are still parked out in the elements like all the others. One last nit to pick. The Starbucks closes at 7pm but the gift shop closes at 11pm. This seems backwards. Bottom Line This is a great hotel in a great location let down by some questionable operating practices and stinky water. Although we were satisfied with our stay, the next time we are in the Orlando area we will not be staying at this Renaissance. There are just too many little issues to make it worth the money.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gulf Beaches, Florida", "Title": "\u201cIt's okay borderline 4star\u201d", "Author": "Toad143", "ReviewID": "UR119495988", "Content": "Don't get me wrong it is a nice hotel, but I would say borderline 4 star.

It worked admirably for this circumstance. Location: A $45 cab ride from airport. About a half hour walk, partly along dirt tracks, from the West Building (the furthest point) at OCCC. Across the parking lot from Seaworld. Check-in: Had a room ready at 1:30 for me, expedia rep on site to purchase attraction tickets and answer questions. Very knowledgable and had access to discount codes associated with each conference. Rooms: HUGE! Clean, updated, Aveda amenities Food: starbucks on site opens at 6:30. Tradewinds had full buffet, but also extensive continental breakfast. Didn't eat lunch or dinner there. Transportation: very convenient public transit. Either the i-drive trolley ($1.25) or #8 lynx bus (2.00) will take you up international drive to the conference centre (stop in front of the Peabody hotel for the West building) and further north to restaurants and nightclubs. I never had to wait more than 5 minutes night or day for a bus. Universal Studios is closest to the G4 i-drive stop, although I cabbed as it threatened rain that day. Pool: large pool and surrounding grounds were stunning!!! More like Mayan Riviera than Orlando. Great loungers, lots of towels, great service from bar and outdoor giftshop. Extensive kids water play zone was in a slightly separate area so the main pool stayed quiet- who needs Aquatica tickets?! Spa: had a good massage, environs relaxing but not luxurious Price: Bid low on Priceline, I got a huge deal.

Some face out onto pool or street, others are interior rooms that face into an open lobby. Sounds strange but it's quite nice. following is a random selection of thoughts about this hotel. Room service was fantastic - good food and the staff were lovely. In-room amenities were lacking. The free coffee was just that - no cream or sugar, so you can only use it if you drink your coffee black. The room itself was nice and clean and comfy, but the bathroom was a bit worn. The finish was worn off the bathtub so that it was bare in several places and had a big dip in the middle where water would pool. They charge $14 for internet hookup in the room but they don't bother to tell you that it's free in the lobby, and all you have to do is open your balcony door to access the free wireless. Quite a money grab and i'm sure everyone who discovers this after they've paid for in-room internet instantly becomes disgruntled. The capper for me was that my room was not serviced, even though i was out of it all day (from about noon) and the do not disturb sign was NOT in place (i double checked this when i found my room still unserviced at night when i returned). When i reported this to the front desk the next morning upon checkout, the staff said i must have left the DND sign on the door. In fact, I did not, as I've mentioned.She then apologized but didn't offer any sort of recompense, which was surprising. I thought perhaps I'd get a call or something in the mail (as she said she would report it), but nothing. I'm not overly picky and I'm not a complainer. I was extremely polite at the desk. But come on...you pay hundreds of dollars for a hotel room so that you don't have to make your bed or wash your own towels -- that's the point of room service -- and then they don't do it, and they don't seem to feel it's a big deal. Overall, the hotel itself is quite nice and the staff are warm and pleasant, but I'm extremely disappointed in the way my lack of room service was handled. I shouldn't have to ask for a remedy - they should have offered it. I hate to think how they would react to a more serious issue (although as hotel stays go, not getting your room cleaned is pretty high on the Crappy Service List).", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, Canada", "Title": "\u201cQuiet getaway from commotion\u201d", "Author": "davidmfiske", "ReviewID": "UR119267537", "Content": "I had to stay at a conference that was at another hotel.

I had a king room with a couch; there was plenty of room for my laptop on the desk, plug-ins were plentiful. Now the bad part. The mattress was HORRIBLE. It was only about 8\" thick and the sheets didn't even go to the bottom of the mattress. It sagged and offered *zero* support. My back hurt every morning. I checked with my colleagues and they all said the same thing, so I know it wasn't just my room. One other thing that bugged me, I had a balcony room but the balcony was shared by the room next door- with a huge potted plant between the space but no actual barrier. If someone in the next room had wanted to look in my sliding doors they could have climbed right over that pot. So I liked the view and the fact I could go outside; the potted plant standing between me an a potential wacko, not so much. I would not stay here again, simply for the mattresses.

Ideal location for our plans to visit SeaWorld and Universal. The room was superb, vast and the bed comfortable. Housekeeping was first class. Where things fall down is in the food and beverage department. On our first night we dined at the Tradewinds restaurant in the lobby. We had to wait for a table despite the fact I could see at least 10 empty tables within. The reception staff at this restaurant are not efficient.and spend more time trying to figure out the seats on their computer system We were called forward but they were not quite ready for us, so we waited. There was an overwhelming smell of fishy oil. This tells me that the kitchen staff do not clean their oil filters often enough, When the food came it was okay but Patrick's calamari was overcooked and was too salty. I had a soup which was fine. The next morning when we wen tthere for breakfast we had to wait for nearly 15 mins. Again tables free inside and 5 staff running about the reception like headless chickens. Why are they sooooo disorganised ? Patrick went to the buffet and 15 minutes later he still wasn't back. Where was he? Out catching the eggs from the chickens ? The trays for scrambled or fried eggs were empty. When he asked a staff member she went to the kitchen and at last appeared with eggs. This is REALLY poor foodservice management. They do not have busboys/ table clearers and the wait staff are expected to do this. the restaurant MUST hire some busboys to keep things flowing. The next day was worse. We came for breakfast and had to stand for THIRTY-FiVE minutes waiting for a table. I gave up and went across to Starbucks. Patrick hung on. I have stayed in many 4 and 5 star hotels and never have ail had to wait 35mins for breakfast. This is supposedly a 4 star hotel. The F&B department needs a new manager and at least 3 busboys. Just a minor point, at the entrance to the Tradewinds restaurant there are faux plastic rocks, they look cheap and nasty, sort of thing you might see at a Macdonalds. They should replace this with plants, these nasty plastic 'rock's are not appropriate here. The lobby area is vast and the kids loved running around the space while their parents stood in line. So all in all, the F&B department needs a serious shake up. The SPA in the hotel is excellent. I had massage by a Chinese lady call Miranda. I recommend her to anyone. Okay bit of a long review, but I hope someone in the hotel passes my comments on the Food and Beverage department.

Excellent location between the Disney Parks, Hotels (check them out for cheap fun), of course Seaworld, Publix & Outlet malls a few miles down the less traveled stretch of Int'l drive. We requested a King room with pull out for the grandson. Bed was comfortable. Room on 3rd floor away from elevators was very quite even though the hotel was busy. Forgot to request sheets for pullout at check-in, however, after calling housekeeping at 9PM, they delivered within ten minutes. The WATERPARK was fabulous for the kids. We were'nt planning on Seaworld or Aquatica so this was the ticket for us. Grandson spent hours sliding and using the uncrowded large pool. Since we were there early we checked in and had hours of fun before dinner. The next day we checked out at eleven and stored luggage, had lunch around the pool, played in the water more then changed clothes for the trip home. We did not use the Starbucks (I bring my own coffeepot) and the line was very long for morning coffee.

Honestly, it was faster to walk to and from the hotel that to wait for the shuttles. Also, the bus shuttle area was not exactly that close to the front entrance of Sea World. We stayed at Sea World until it closed and there was so much traffic getting out of the parking lot that I was happy to just walk across the street as opposed to sitting in the traffic on the shuttle trying to exit the parking lot.

Be aware, we have been warned that these are scams to get your credit card information. I was disappointed that the hotel was unable to stop solicitors (whether real or not) from roaming around the hotel.

At check in we were told it was free and then we were told it was $6 per day. The staff could not get their stories straight as far as fees were concern... My biggest concern was when TWO staff members told me there were no stair cases at the hotel (there was a long line for the elevator so we wanted to hike it instead). I gently reminded these staff member that fire laws require exit stairs... These are the people that we are expected to rely on for information in an emergency? Seriously? You think the building has no stairs?

Generally speaking you can never go wrong with staying with this particular hotel chain. However, I have to admit I was very disappointed from many various aspects of this hotel.

I booked this hotel through Priceline and stated I wished to stay at a 4 star hotel in this area. 99% of the time I agree with the rating they give the hotels. However, they missed the star rating mark on this hotel. I would give this hotel a 3 star rating. This may not seem like a big difference, but believe when I tell you that one star even \u00bd a star makes a difference. My emotions really want to give this hotel a 2 \u00bd star rating. Let me explain why\u2026 1. The hotel looks very old and shows its age. They made a meager attempt to make it something. However, that something\u2026. is just plain odd. It looks appears they are having money problems and are trying their best to keep the hotel afloat. 2. Crazy additional expenses such as $15 per day for self parking, $14.95 per day internet (Most 4 star offer this complementary) Breakfast buffet was $20 plus taxes and gratuity = $26.00 for eggs and bacon etc. Evening snack personal size pizza was $18. No extra gratuity added. Business center charges .55 per minute for dial up speeds. .59 per printed page. Over $26 in less than 11 minutes. 3. Imagine the worst bed you have ever slept in and you will have a good idea of what to expect. The king beds only have standard pillows. No king pillows. That really isn\u2019t that bad but the bed is horrible. 4. The staff does seem to offer the basic customer service that you would expect from a 4 star hotel. That is about wraps it up.

It's your typical new Florida hotel with a huge courtyard in the middle and the rooms surround it. Some of the rooms have balconies that overlook the courtyard. The courtyard has some restaurants and huge areas for conventions, etc. We stayed on the 9th floor, front of the hotel, overlooking Sea World. We picked this hotel due to its proximity to Sea World. While you can walk right across the street to Sea World, we had to drive to Discovery Cove and Aquatica where we spent most of our time. Unfortunately, this hotel is not near Disney and there is no shuttle from the hotel. It's about 20 minutes to Downtown Disney from this location. When you first drive up, it's somewhat confusing. The self parking lot has a gate and you can't get in without a key. There are daily charges to park there also. So, you're forced to valet park in front which also costs money. When we walked in, you are greeted immediately and helped. The front desk was awesome and made check-in a breeze. Since we were Marriott Rewards members, we were offered a package of free valet parking, internet and breakfast for a slight additional charge. This was great while we were there, but turned into a checkout nightmare when we were charged for these services instead of being credited. Technically, we weren't supposed to get this package (we were a day early) so there was some disagreement on the charges. Eventually, they credited everything. But if we didn't have this package, there would have been alot of extra charges at check out which totally inflates the actual cost to stay here. The hotel itself is either new or newly renovated. Everything is clean and trendy. The rooms are your typical Mariott: roomy, big beds with lots of pillows, a nice flat screen TV and a desk area to do work or work on your laptop. The Internet is not free in the rooms. When we were there is was $15 a day. Not sure why Fairfield Inns offer free internet access but these upscale Mariotts do not. In the public areas, there is some free Wi-Fi, but it's quite slow. The rooms are excellent. They are clean and updated including the bathroom, all renovate. We didn't hear any noise from guests next to us or above us. The sleep experience was excellent especially when you're walking around all day at the Parks and you're tired. The pool out back is really nice. Alot of seating, a pool bar, towels, etc. There are outdoor fireplaces in use at night. It's a big hotel with alot of space. You can see that they must have conventions and/or business meetings. When we were there, it didn't feel packed with people especially during the day when everyone is out at the Parks. In the Courtyard, there are several restaurants/bars, a Starbucks and a gift store. We ate at the TradeWinds breakfast buffet which was pretty good each day. The service was excellent and the food selection adequate. We ate there because it was part of the package but it is somewhat expensive for breakfast if we had to outright pay for it. But, you could definitely eat a big breakfast here instead of the Parks and save time. We also ate at the Boardwalk Bar the first night because of a late check in. It's your typical sports bar/pub food. The food was fine and has alot of TVs. Overall, this is a really nice, clean updated hotel and a perfect location if your vacation includes Sea World. It was kid friendly and perfect for families. It's very quiet for a good night sleep. The downsides are that it's not close to Disney and no shuttle, there seems to be quite a few additional incidental charges and the Florida taxes that are tacked on every day, you have to pay for parking and the Internet is not free.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rockford", "Title": "\u201cEverything is VERY BIG\u201d", "Author": "IL-Snowbirds", "ReviewID": "UR102301124", "Content": "If you're going to Sea World you can't beat the location.

Paid $20 for a very mediocre breakfast buffet aimed at families e.g. Froot Loop dispensers and cheap danish for the kiddies. Huge size carrot and celery sticks looked like fodder for Sasquatch.

As we pulled up the hotel is very nicely lanscaped with beautiful grounds. The valet area that you pull into is very grand with huge curtains hanging down to the ground. As you enter the hotel you see large TV's showing all kinds of underwater fish. Just Beautiful! We checked in with no problems and were given a room on the 8th floor. As we entered the room I could not believe how huge it was! Nice room with 2 beds, nice bathroom with Aveda products and a flat screen TV. Very nice and clean. We went back down to get something to eat. We ate at the bar area and the appitizers were very good. We also ate at Tradewinds and thought that was really good too. The French Onion Soup was delish! There is a Starbucks in the hotel that was good too. Nice gift shop with good selection of clothes and gifts. The hotel is a convention hotel and they had a realtors convention going on during the days we were there. It's a different feeling than being at a Disney hotel but for the price it was really nice. The pool area and grounds are gorgeous. Really nice landscaping, nice fountains, a nice outdoor area with gas fire, gazebo, 2 hot tubs, tennis courts, kids area and baby pool. Nice bar area too. It was cold when we were there but we did go in the hot tub. The first night I forgot to take the do not distubrb sign off the door as we left the hotel so our room was not made up when we came back to the hotel. I called down to the front desk to ask for some toletries and within 5 minutes someone was at our room with more Aveda Products. Very good service. We took a cab from hotel to Animal Kingdom and it was around $25 for 4 people. No problems there. From Downtown Disney took a cab and it was $12 for 4. Again no big deal. Overall we didn't mind having a car. You would have to walk for different restaurants but we just ate at the hotel. Very happy here at the Renaissance.

The room was spacious - especially since we usually stay at the Disney value resorts where things are so small and cramped. The room had a lot of space and the bathroom was enormous, with two sinks. The balcony was small but we moved our chairs out there and it was a wonderful view. We listened to the waterfall all night (if you leave your door ajar). Hotel grounds, lobby, atrium area and hallways and rooms are very clean. No issues with our housekeeping service. Even the elevators were fast. I had no complaints about this place at all except ..... they charge $15/day for self parking. I don't like that. Why don't they just shove it into the room rate so we don't know about it. I can see why Disney charges you to park - they have people manning the parking lots all day and trams are running. The Renaissance has a self-serve ticket machine and nobody around. Some people have mentioned their parking was free but I don't know how. I'm a Marriott member and it still wasn't free. Anyway, this is a fab resort with a great location for Sea World. Disney hotels are better location for Disney parks but then again they are so small and cramped. I highly recommend this place.

First-off, the location - just perfect. We couldn't have asked for a better located hotel. Just off the I-4 and 528, it's really easy to get to from airports/disney/universal, as well as being just off I-Drive. If you want to be on I-Drive, it's maybe not ideal, and it's certainly best for those with a car, but if you're happy to drive the 5 minutes to Pointe Orlando for dinner, it's brilliant, away from the hustle of I-Drive. In addition, it's easy walking distance to SeaWorld, and the concierge are happy to drive you to Aquatica and SeaWorld for free (in a Cadillac Escalade too, which feels very classy!). Second, the quality of the rooms - we were in a King Room, and it was HUGE! The room was beautiful, the bed huge, with a desk, sofa and armchair, big HD flat-screen, walk-in wardrobe, fridge, safe. We had a pool view, sunset view and no balcony, which we didn't mind at all. In fact, as we had a Yellowjacket nest right outside our window we were glad, although we loved watching our little wasps working away each morning! Third, the hotel in general - the pool was beautiful, with cosy cabanas, 2 hot tubs, and a pool bar. We enjoyed evening swims, so we could've done with the pool being a couple of degrees warmer, but we loved the funoodles and snorkels that were available. The atrium area is just breathtaking. We spent a bit of time in the Boardwalk bar - the food there is brilliant, as are the cocktails. Try the Renaissance Sunrise and the Rum Runner! Reception staff were very happy to help with any queries we had, and gave us directions leaflets, restaurant recommendations and change for the arcade, among other things! We got a glass of champagne at reception, and when I was given a false charge at the end of the trip, the staff was more than happy to take the charge off, with no quibbles. When I enquired about a coach booking I'd made to Busch Gardens, and the time we had to be at the bus stop, the staff went above and beyond the call of duty, calling to make sure we were booked in. The fitness centre is also brilliant, and I enjoyed spending a couple of quiet mornings there. We went to Tradewinds one morning for breakfast, and the buffet was fantastic; I was very impressed by the quality and number of items on offer. The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the price - $20 for breakfast is just too steep. Parking is free, which is great, as is WiFi in the lobby - don't get internet in your room, go downstairs! In addition, the shop is great, and has everything we needed during our time there. The laundry facilities were also top-notch, and it's brilliant having clean clothes halfway through your holiday. My only complaint about the Renaissance was the lack of an appropriately-priced breakfast or WiFi - at what is quite an expensive hotel, I believe such facilities should be increased. In addition, I didn't appreciate what was quite a pushy timeshare salesperson who had a desk in the atrium - while I appreciate that Marriott has a timeshare club and they need to promote that, I found the salesperson unnecessarily pushy, to the point that we avoided using the door near the salesperson's desk for the majority of our holiday.

If you don't need to walk out straight onto International Drive then I would definitely go with this hotel! Best place we ate at was Flippers Pizzeria. The staff and pizzas were fantastic.

Benefit of staying here was that you could walk to both Seaworld - really just opposite the hotel and round the corner to Aquatica - about a 7 minute walk, thus saving on having to pay between $12 - $15 dollars for the priviledge of parking your car there. Also parking at the hotel for residents was free. Downside for me (as I was not the one that was driving) was there you are not really within walking distance of any shops or restaurants - we usually stop somewhere on international drive so I am more used to just going out of the hotel and going to a restaurant or the shops and you cannot do that there. There is an i-trolley stop just outside the hotel and we did use this once but they don't run late and getting back to the hotel from Universal Studios was a horrendous $25 - the taxi that we had was driven by someone with no skills whatsoever, who drove like a madman and it was a sheer relief to just get back to our accommodation in one piece (although feeling quite sick). The staff were wonderful - very helpful and a late checkout for us was not a problem for them and my partner said he would definately like to go there again. I would also definately return but would make sure that I am listed to drive as well next time.", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oviedo, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWow!

It was fantastic! We pulled up and were immediately greeted and offered bag assistance and parking. Walking into the lobby is like walking into a complete oasis. It is open, peaceful and has many small, quiet spaces to sit and relax. There is a waterfall in the lobby - very relaxing. We had a standard king room up on the 8th floor. It was HUGE. One of the largest hotel rooms that I've stayed in. High ceilings, large pullout couch, seating area, desk, etc. More than enough room for all of us to spread out. We had dinner in the Tradewinds restaurant. The food was fantastic and top notch service. The seating area extends into the relaxing lobby which made it even better as the atmosphere in the evening there is even more relaxing. We also spent some time out at the pool. This area was probably the most amazing and unexpected. There are landscaped garden areas, many small seating areas, one with fire pit. There are huge checker and chess games (the chess pieces were as big as my child!) and ping pong and foosball games on the lanai. The main pool is huge and clean. There is also a children's pool, 2 hot tubs and a playground. All are surrounded by lush landscaping, comfy, cushioned lougers and some cabana-like seating that I'd never seen before. You really feel like you are at a much higher-end resort. We didn't use the pool bar, but it appeared very convenient and also in a beautiful setting. We walked over to SeaWorld twice during our stay and both times were given cold water as we departed and more cold water as we returned. The bellman would actually come walking toward us with the water as we would be coming in across the parking lot. He anticipated our needs - a major gold star in my book.

If you plan to visit Sea World Orlando, naturally this is one of the nicer places to stay at. We stayed there at around July 4 but came out unimpressed. The property is huge, parking is painless, the swimming pool is a bit crowded, but nice, and the lobby is nicely decorated/built. However, the service, for a hotel with this class, is sub par. The front desk was polite, but cold, no smile whatsoever from both of the people who worked there that day. The hotel \"navigator\" (concierge) was exactly the same, polite, but cold. Coming back to the hotel after Sea World did its big fireworks display can be VERY tricky. Traffic was a mess and they closed one of the street near the property, so I had to drive around it. My big gripe was the \"lost and found\" department, which I think should be called \"lost and lost\". When we were there, we left $200 worth of electronics (mostly video games for kids) at the room. On the next day, once we realized what happened, we immediately called the hotel and was transferred to the lost and found department. On the first call, we only got a voicemail asking to leave a message with a phone number to call, and we did. We never got a call. So one day we called again, and was transferred again to a voicemail, and we did leave another mesage, but again, no call back. The third time, we asked to talk to a real person, so front desk finally did transfer me to a real person. Unfortunately, the person said nothing was ever found in the room we stayed in, so we were very disappointed.

I hung my towels but when I came back to the room they were both folded and arranged with the other towels. I purposefully moved the towels I wasn't going to use out of the way.

We were never \"nickled and dimed\", as at some hotels: all of the resort amenities, including the fitness center, were complimentary, and the fitness center was also open 24 hours.

At dinner, we were entertaining a European friend, and he was absolutely amazed to find a favorite (and somewhat rare) champagne on the menu.

As a result, we never felt \"overwhelmed\" by the convention as we do at some hotels. The Renaissance is located within walking distance of Sea World, so we had the convenience of accessing the park without having to drive or take a shuttle, yet the hotel is secluded by trees so that we never felt burdened by traffic or noise from the park. The staff is friendly and genuine; although busy at times, we never saw anyone lose their cool or treat us with impatience or, worse, ignore us. The service was excellent, wherever we went. The fact that our room came in around $100 a night absolutely amazes me, given the service, amenities, location, and overall beauty of this hotel.

Again, I was assured that things were set for the room next to us. It was a great surprise when we returned to find that my parents were not in the room next to us and did not have an atrium view, actually their room had a view of a rooftop. I was quite embarrassed, since this was a birthday gift for them. My daughter had looked so forward to being right next door to Grandma and Grandpa and being able to go back and forth between our two rooms. Now, they were on the opposite end of the hall. When I went to the desk to find out why the room next to us had been given to someone else, they had no explanation, but told us we could move to two other adjoining rooms. None of us wanted wanted to go through the inconvenience of packing up and moving for one night. To top it off, the people that they put in the room that was supposed to be for my parents were so loud. We were up between midnight and one. Since this was a gift for my parents, I had asked that they not get a bill. Well, they received one under their door. It was not included on ours.

When we arrived, our room was freezing. We turned up the thermostat and nothing happened so after our call, a staff person from engineering came up to our room and told us that the system was very slow and we needed to turn up the thermostat to 90 degrees if we wanted the room to get warmer. We did but the room did not warm up until about 12 hours later, thus making for a rather chilly evening.

The restaurants were decent - not great but consistently good - and they were reasonably priced. My colleague and I ate sushi at the Mist three times, and ate at the Tradewinds and Boardwalk twice. I also loved having the Starbucks onsite, and used it every morning. The pool and workout rooms were top notch, as nice as I've seen most anywhere.

My husband and I had taken two friends along as a treat (so 2 x adjacent double rooms), as we had two very significant birthdays to celebrate, plus it was their first trip to Orlando, so we wanted somewhere special which would impress them and provide comfort. Well, the Renaissance certainly did that! We all loved the hotel and we had a fabulous 10 day holiday there. Reay, a concierge, cannot be praised enough. He was so helpful when we had trouble with our hire car. He was also incredibly kind and helpful to me when he saw my mobility problems and he instantly produced a wheelchair for my use throughout our stay (an absolute godsend). Lovely man and a great asset to the hotel. Next for thanks and compliments is Terry, the Front Desk Manager. Brilliant, friendly and always helpful. He always seemed to be around and he always had tickets for this or that, or for free drinks at various restaurants. Another lovely and helpful man. Resourceful too. Oh, and several times he gave us bottles of iced water when he saw us hot and weary. Mike, a server at Tradewinds. Friendly, chatty and very knowledgeable about US wines. We really enjoyed chatting with him (and comparing notes about wine and roller coasters!). As I've said, we really enjoyed our stay at the Renaissance, and it is the best location you could wish for for Seaworld. We were very impressed with the whole atrium and entrance areas, and our rooms were spacious (we had a great view over Seaworld, which we'd specifically requested), clean and extremely comfortable with plenty of wardrobe/drawer space. Splendid bathrooms too. We had 3 or 4 evenings when we got \"home\" quite late and very tired after a busy day, so being able to just head for the hotel's restaurant, Tradewinds, was such a bonus. In our experience it is actually quite unusual to find such a great hotel restaurant, so this was a terrific surprise. We thoroughly enjoyed some brilliant food there - the Black Angus Burger is tremendous, likewise the Harris Ranch Ribeye Steak. The Lobster Bisque is a meal in itself! Great selection of wines too. I'd read beforehand that the Renaissance serve an incredible breakfast, so we were looking forward to that. What I'd read was absolutely true - the buffet breakfasts at the Renaissance were superb, plentiful and delicious. On our last day, needing to return the hire car early afternoon, we had lunch by the pool in the The Palms pool bar. What a lovely, relaxing hour that was! Altogether a fantastic hotel, which ensured we had a fantastic holiday. We just cannot praise the Renaissance Orlando Resort enough. We will definitely stay there again, and will most certainly recommend it to friends or anyone. You can tell we enjoyed it, can't you? :o) Thank you, Renaissance! (I should point out that at the time we stayed the overnight parking was still free - or at least included in our holiday price.

So good location if you are going to Sea World. I should mention it is 12 miles from the airport and, although we didn't go, on the trolley route for the nearby Orlando Premium outlets (bus stops in front of the hotel). We also enjoyed the outdoor pool. Kids had a blast while mom and dad sat at the outdoor cafe/bar. It was a nice set up - great place for snack and cocktail in a covered yet outdoor setting right next to the pool. We used the on premises Starbucks for breakfast (which was overpriced) and Tradewinds Restaurant for dinner. Again, food was a little expensive ($80 dinner with a few drinks) but the food was indeed very good.

We took up the offer to pay for a gift from Shamu, and requested extra towels. Appreciated the complimentary champagne when checking in-but went to our room to find no gift from Shamu (we wanted to suprise our 4yo)-and three towels for three of us. Flip lock to adjoining room wouldn't throw a lock-so they sent an engineer to come fix that, while someone else searched for our gift we ordered. Located fridge in room (under safe)-put milk in there; came to find out next day it was an old courtesy bar-and the employee that assisted us couldn't understand why they hadn't put in the new refrigerators yet, as they had arrived. Brought us up an old mini fridge-door was unbolted from hinge on top-so you had to lift up door to open/close. That worked fine, until it was unplugged while we were at the parks one day. Mattresses are not at all what they rave them to be-remember those egg crates you'd put on top of dorm mattresses in college? Not too different. Our mattress was concaved to the middle so we took turns sleeping with our four yo-otherwise, we'd roll into each other during the night (the mattress was so bad that the bottom sheet wouldn't stay on). We had a late night one night at the parks (Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween)-and returned to our room at 12:30a to find that it had never been made up during the day. Garbage was full, beds unmade-and no towels. Called downstairs to ask what happened-they were unsure. Had to ask if we could at least get towels. Offered newspaper delivery when we checked in-never did get that all week-each day was a different reason as to why it hadn't been delivered. If you have ever stayed at Opryland Hotel-imagine that big open atrium area-that's how this hotel is designed-so all the hotel rooms' doors face out to that open area-it's loud til about 1/1:30a because of people congregating downstairs in the lobby area (popular sushi bar, etc)-the only saving grace to this is the darkening curtains your room has-so we'd sleep in later, but missed a lot of time being at the parks early. Pool is fabulous-especially being able to have a meal right there-they are a little stingy on the towels down there (tough some times to get one)-but if you come at the beginning of the day, there is one at each lounge chair. Food is good in the restaurants-went to all but sushi bar-neat having Starbucks right in the lobby. Disappointed in the valet-one guy in particular would be texting on his cell each morning-as we stood waiting for him to offer to assist us-when he finally did call for our car and it arrived-he'd open the door for my husband-not my daughter and I-and we quickly realized by day two-he was more interested in the tip, then in helping the ladies out. Love that they have computers set up in the lobby specifically to print your boarding passes (nice touch). If you are truly looking to get away from work, this wasn't the place to go. They really seemed to cater to business conferences and they were packed-at the pool, restaurants, and throughout the lobby-a constant reminder of work at home, not of people enjoying their leisure time/vacation. Had an extra-and hefty room service charge on our check out bill for our first night-though we had used room service once, it wasn't our first night. Front desk couldn't provide me what the charge was far, and simply removed it stating that they probably charged the wrong room number (slightly disconcerting). Our last trip, we had stayed at Hyatt Grand Cypress-and although we paid considerably more for our stay-the customer service was amazing compared to here.

I asked if there was a balcony in this room and was told no, and then we were offered a room on the 8th floor with a balcony, which we accepted. First point to make, the reception staff are very friendly, courteous and helpful, and this made a welcome change from some of the other hotels we have stayed at ! The atrium is lovely, very airy and spacious, with two bars and a restaurant, and also seating areas (where you see many business folk on their laptops) - there is also a Starbucks, which was handy in the morning, a shop that sells general sundries, and also the Expedia desk, who were also very helpful in arranging things for us. We flew with Virgin so we had complimentary Mears transport, so all we had to do was get a voucher from reception and then arrange our transport - all very easy! The room was very spacious, with a double sink unit in the bathroom and good shower unit. The beds were by far the most comfortable beds i have ever slept in, just gorgeous. You also get an LCD flat screen tv with basic cable, as well as 2 armchairs and a table. The view from the balcony through the sliding doors looked out onto the pool area and tennis courts and out to Orlando. I really cannot say enough good things about this hotel, we had a perfect stay, and if people were worried (like we were) about not driving on this holiday, dont be. The Mears transport is excellent and very promt for drop off and pick ups, and furthermore, there is an IRide and Lynx stop right outside the hotel, perfect for going up to I Drive, or even to Disney (Number 50 Lynx). And as i said, Seaworld is across the street,so its a short walk for there and the Busch Gardens shuttle. The swimming pool area is beautifully landscaped, and there are loungers and also a bar - the pool was lovely! For kids there is also an arcade area. A fitness centre is also located on the ground floor, and also a Fed Ex office which you have 24 hour access too if you dont have wi fi, you can use the computers in there for a small charge. One minor thing, we only ate in house once, and that was room service, it came to $43 all in for two cheeseburgers and fries.

We didn't get the type of room that we had requested, ie pool view or atrium view, despite the hotel being very quiet. When I asked about moving rooms, we were given the option of a pool view room, but was informed that guests could be in the pool until any time of night, and I was wary of lots of late night noise, so we stayed where were. Although the hotel had apparently been renovated, our room wasn't one of them and the ceiling had stains and needed painted. You could also hear the guests in the room next door, which luckily was only for a few nights. Also, our fridge didn't work at all. I'd advise guests to ask for a room at the front of the hotel with a balcony, overlooking Seaworld. On the plus side, the room was large and the beds very comfortable. The hotel staff were nice, although I was taken aback by the comments from one of the Duty Managers, 'Terry'. During our first week, the hotel fire alarm went off twice on seperate nights. This could of course happen anywhere, but I was concerned that the alarm was very quiet and only sounded in the main hotel reception area. There was no alarm in our room, which I feel is a safety issue, especially for the hard of hearing. My husband bearly heard it either. I looked out onto the balcony, down towards reception, as many other guests were also doing. No-one knew if we were to evacuate our rooms, there were no instructions to be heard after the alarm stopped. There was also no staff on reception when I tried phoning to ask if we were to evacuate, I had to keep waiting for the call to be answered. I mentioned this to the security guard when we returned one evening and he said a duty manager would give me a call, which'Terry' did. I expressed my concern about the low volume of the fire alarm and how many guests would simply not hear it, then it was simply turned off with no information. I said that if a fire alarm went off in a British hotel, it would be loud enough for everyone to be aware of it and everyone would need to evacuate. Terry didn't seem to have a clue about the fire alarm, as 'they have never had a fire'. He admitted he didn't know if the alarm would get louder if a fire was nearer our floor or not. Do the staff never have fire drills here? I certainly didn't feel reassured atfer speaking with this member of staff. The buffet breakfast in Tradewinds was good, although you wouldn't want to spend $20 per person each day on breakfast. We often went to Starbucks, but this had limited choice and always sold out of croissants by 9.30am. Hotel transfers to Universal or Aquatica were complimentary, when arranged, although had set times to drop you and return for you. Hotel pool was very nice, plenty of loungers which were complimentary. Car park had plenty of spaces very close to the hotel (again, we were there off peak). Food was good in the Sports Bar. Overall, we felt it was a reasonably good hotel but certainly not '5*' as we'd read in the Virgin Holiday brochure, and not worth the money we paid,. On checking out, reception staff didn't ask how we'd enjoyed our stay, which was unusual. We felt we'd get a similar hotel/facilities for better value elsewhere.", "Date": "October 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tarryholme, Irvine, Ayrshire", "Title": "\u201c\"Outstanding Hotel\"\u201d", "Author": "Pamally", "ReviewID": "UR47103243", "Content": "Just back from a 2 week holiday in Orlando staying at the Renaissance at Seaworld booked through Virgin Holidays.

My partner and myself stayed at this hotel in March 2007 for week. It was a package holiday booked via My Travel. I was very impressed with the hotel but when we arrived, they were in the middle of a refurbishment. I was a little disapointed with the holiday company as we did not get a holiday rep and we were kind of dumped there by the holiday company. We were not given any advice, maps or local information. We did not see anyone from My Travel during the holiday from when we got off the plane untill we got back on it. Now to the hotel. It was excellent. The room was very large, bright and light. The bath room was large and had two sinks. There was a large flat screen TV in the room. All the staff were very helpfull and provided local transport to the Disney parks. Sea world is just across the road and took 2 mins to walk there. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It is cheaper than staying in Disney and it was only 10 minutes in the car. The dining was excellent and we had room service most nights as it was cheap enough. The bar was good if a little expensive. The buffet breakfast was one of the best I have ever tasted and the evening meals were excellent. There was no Starbucks when we were there but they were half way through building when we stayed. We used the pool once and this was good. We were the only people in it.

I struggled to see why this hotel receives such good reviews. Don\u2019t get me wrong it is nice but it lacks something, character probably and attention to detail in the rooms. It\u2019s just a square box with an amazing lobby and standard rooms. We booked this Hotel with Virgin as a package from their \"Platinum Selection\". When we arrived at the hotel and walked through the doors you can see where they spent the money refurbishing. A very nice looking atrium with the sound of waterfalls and the lighting giving the hotel a warm glow. We were very impressed with the atrium. Checking in was fine but even though the guy behind the desk was very helpful I don\u2019t think he really knew what he was doing. He offered us 3 different rooms but then retracted the offer each time and we ended up with the room we originally booked, which was fine for us anyway. Didn\u2019t receive the champagne as advertised and no help with our bags. Entering the room the first thing we noticed was the badly fitted carpets under and around the door. Moving on, the room was just ok, nothing amazing. From a distance the room looks fine and before I reel out all the things that were wrong with the room it was a relief that it wasn\u2019t a smelly, damp, dark dump like the last 2 hotels we stayed in when visiting Orlando last, but then we did pay nearly double this time and expected excellent rooms. Look closely and you will notice that the carpets were not hovered in the corners; the furniture in the room was quite tatty and rotten in places by the fridge and just a general lack of quality. None of the bedding fitted properly and had marks. Most of the towels were old and had stains as did the carpet in places. Check out the photos I added and you will see what I mean. I had mixed feelings about this hotel. In one hand it was a nice hotel with some nice touches but on the other it\u2019s a bit of a let down. I didn\u2019t expect a perfect hotel but all the small little niggles added up to the hotel being just an average one.

With Champagne on arrival we then had a choice of rooms, with 2 Queen or a King size bed. We went for the King size and also requested a room overlooking Sea World which was accommodated for us on the 8th floor. The room was very spacious with a lovely view and large bathroom / living area. We were also offered a choice of newspapers to be delivered to our door each morning free of charge which we enjoyed. We did not drive at all on our trip so we picked this hotel through Virgin as it had free scheduled transportation to Walt Disney World, Universal & Sea World parks. Although the Hotel does not mention that the transport takes you to Disney it does if you have booked through Virgin. All you need to do to arrange your free transport is pick up tickets from the concierge and hop along to Expedia (next to Starbucks) who will arrange it all for you. The Mears transport was always on time if not early, just don't be late as they won't wait for you too long! The pool was large and quiet and always had sun beds and towels available. Lovely tennis \\ basket ball courts to use with equipment plus table tennis, foosball and games room. The restaurants were reasonably priced and the staff were fantastic. We used the Sports bar frequently as the Tradwinds restaurant seemed to be closed in the evenings for dinner (which was a shame but wasn\u2019t inconvenient). The only thing I would say despite this is there could have been more choice of food at the other bars. The location was perfect for us as it was out of the way of the hustle and bustle of the busy part of I \u2013 Drive so it was nice to come back to after a hectic day at the parks. You can walk to Sea World which is literally across the car park. We did purchase a 14 day I-Ride trolley bus pass which helped us get up and down I-drive for the restaurants \\ shops \\ Ripleys etc. the stop was right outside the hotel.

We found this hotel to be of a very high standard and all the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. On arrival, we were actually given a choice of three different room options and were allowed to view them all before making a decision.- we actually had interconnecting rooms so that the children could have their space and we could have ours. Both bedrooms were lovely and included lounge areas with large flat screen TVs and beautiful bathrooms. Our bedroom also had an enormous balcony that overlooked Seaworld and, being on the seventh floor, we were able to watch their nightly firework displays. The hotel has three restaurants: Tradewinds, Boardwalk and Mist \u2013 a sushi and spirit bar. It also has \u201cThe Palms\u201d poolside bar and grill and a Starbucks. We found \u201cBoardwalk\u201d particularly good value for money, as the food was excellent and very reasonably priced compared with some of the restaurants in the surrounding area. On arrival at the hotel we were actually issued with a discount card too, and this enabled us to get 10% off any food or drink we purchased from the hotel. The hotel was beautiful inside and very well planned, which made it easy to find your way around. It also had impressive glass lifts which could whisk you up to any floor in seconds. The poolside area, like the rest of the hotel and gardens, was beautifully kept and very pleasant to relax in. Free drink samples and cold flannels were often brought round to keep guests cool and refreshed \u2013 complimentary pool towels were also provided. There were also tennis courts, a basketball court, a volleyball area, a putting area, children\u2019s play area and paddling pool. There were no hire charges for using rackets, etc., and the entire pool area was fenced in with good quality fencing and secure gates (which closed automatically behind you) making it the perfect environment for people with young children. The hotel also has a spa and a modern air conditioned gym. We actually had a hire car included in our package with free hotel parking from Virgin. However, the hotel did offer free transportation to Universal studios, Islands of Adventure, Discovery Cove, Busch Gardens and Aquatica \u2013 Seaworld, of course, is directly across the road. We did use the coach to Busch Gardens, as it saved us having to find our way there and having to pay for parking (which is $12 per day at all the parks).

The grounds are beautfiul and very child friendly (even though I dont have children). The beauty about this from a childless point of view is that there is a seperate splash pool and play area for the children, so theyre not in the main pool....which was great. There is quite a high fence surrounds the entire pool area so the little darlings would be safe from taking off, which I thought was a very good idea for those with little people.

Exercise room along with free weights a plenty of cardio machines. Wake up early and the place is quiet and the fruit is fresh in the gym! The only negative to the Renaissance is the price. I did not have to pay because it was a business trip but after paying $16 for valet a night, ($12 for self parking), $15 a day internet access, (free in the lobby), and expensive hotel food (of course); I am not sure this place is one of the better value hotels... unless you want to spend a lot of money. You are also taxed on the final bill for the internet service and parking. There are other Marriott's in the area that have the Marriott quality without the resort/spa price tag. Other than that, it is family friendly, with a lot of children running around, but it is good for business as well.

They then sent us to a hotel 4 miles away which they told us was equal in quality. The marriott courtyard was NOT equal in quality. To make matters worse, they had no rooms there either when we got there. So they moved us to yet another hotel--again, nowhere near equal quality. We were told that we could check in to the Renaissance the next day at 4pm. So in addition to not being close to the parks we were visiting, and the inconvenience of two different hotels, we were out of a hotel for the afternoon--we had to check out of one hotel by 11 or 12, and we couldn't check in to the Renaissance until 4pm.

Dont plan on eating inside the hotel like you can in Disney World for a reasonable price. We went out to eat every day we were there, places to eat are pretty close by. Starbucks sign said thery closed at 6pm but they were closed everyday by 3pm? Rooms dont have microwaves for those of you who have small children and you have to request a refrigerator because the ones already in the rooms dont work. Also having to pay for parking ($12 a day) is in my mind crazy. Also having to take a shuttle to other parks except Sea World you had to make reservations 90 min in advance and the pickup times are preset so you have to pick from the times avaliable.

The muffin was smaller than the ones you can bake at home. If I had known how it was a mini muffin, I certainly would not have ordered it. When I asked the server about it, she just smiled and said \"I know\", but did nothing else. She didn't seem to have a strong comprehension of the english language. There are no restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. I didn't have a rental car, so I took the I-trolley twice to go shopping and to eat out. It was convenient and economical.

We had requested a slightly early check-in which we were offered although also offered a room upgrade if we waited. Balcony rooms are nice and worth the wait if you can upgrade. Location is excellent for SeaWorld - just across the car park although be aware that the hotel charge guests 12USD per day for parking (which is a bit cheeky considering the hotel is only accessible by car, therefore 4 stars awarded not 5) so it's not like you'll save money. BUT it does mean that adult guests you can take advantage of the free beer in SeaWorld and just walk home! The other advantage with the location is you're right on the junction for the I-4 which means you can get to Disney in 10-15 mins without having to go anywhere near the highly congested International Drive (aka I-Drive). Whilst I-Drive is nearby it's not walkable so you'd still need to drive if you want to go out to the bars, restaurants, shops and mini golf that are located further north (and you would over a longer stay as the hotel restaurants are a bit limited and pricey) or I suppose you could get that elusive green trolley bus that stops outside although I wouldn't want to use that regularly as they are very slow and not frequent. Hotel itself is a massive venue, geared up for meetings, incentives, conferences, events which isn't necessarily a bad thing (rooms are large and well appointed catering for business guests) but it's certainly not cosy. Pool area is nice and spacious and a good area to relax in between themeparks. Overall would definitely recommend if you want quick access to SeaWorld and Disney (and Busch), probably not if the Universal parks and the lively I-Drive scene is more your thing. P.S.

We only dined once at the hotel while we were there, when we had room service on our last night, and the food was great! The room was spacious, with a very comfortable bed and beautiful bathroom. All of the decor in the hotel's lobby area was stunning. I have stayed in 5-star hotels that were not as nice as this one. If you are looking for a beautiful hotel and great service at a reasonable price, I highly recommend the Renaissance Resort. You will not be dissappointed!

I live in Florida so I have visited Orlando my entire life for quick weekend getaways. Stayed at numerous Disney properties including Contemporary, and Grand Floridian. Also have stayed at the Peabody, Omni & Ritz and JW Marriott nearby and none of them can compare to the overall quality and service of this hotel. Firstly, for the price this hotel is the best value for money compared to some of the others like the Peabody or JW who charge random crazy rates depeding on what convention is going on (although you can get off-season priceline rates to the Peabody for around $60/night). I was at the Renaissance for business and the location can't be beat. It is one light from I-4 West and 2 lights from I-4 East bound. To get to the convention center you don't even have to go on any main roadways, and even if you do it is only the extremely quiet end of I-Drive. Also, I liked that I could get to the Premium Outlets mall via the back of I-Drive quicker than if I took the highway. The hotel itself had great service from the moment you valet. At check-in they offer you a complimentary glass of Moet champagne and your room elevators are literally 15 feet away from the reception desk so you don't have to carry your bags far. The hotel has a great recently remodeled atrium lobby along with remodled rooms. The rooms have raised unique ceilings that are unlike any hotel I have stayed at. Also, the rooms are extra large so there's plenty of room for your luggage as well as a sitting area to relax. If you can, get a room with an interior balcony. I would reccomend that over an exterior balcony if you are there for business. The bathrooms and tv stand are all granite The hotel also has a full service FedEx Kinkos in the lobby. The sports bar has mediocre food but the furnishing is top notch as well as all the HD tv's they had. None of that basic Vizio brand here, only LG and Sony. The sushi bar in the center of the hotel had great food as well as extremely nice furnishings. It would be used much more if it wasn't in the middle of the lobby. They have no music playing anywhere in the restaurant so the ambiance is pretty dull. The hotel also had a great pool area with a pool bar and full size tennis, basketball, and I'm pretty sure volleyball court. The fitness center was also great with nice gym quality machines and fresh towels and headphones placed on every machine. All the treadmills have built-in tvs and there is complimentary fruit and larger towels for when you are done.

We HAVE to say that service was excellent from BEFORE we arrived. Booking the hotel twelve months in advance meant we had time to obtain information prior to our trip and the hotel responded promptly to all emails and even sent us an information pack about the hotel, local transport and the surrounding area. This staff service carried on right through our holiday. They were always happy to help and very cheerful and chatty. We didn\u2019t have a car so were dropped off right outside the door and therefore saved on the daily parking charges others have mentioned. Check-in was a breeze and wife and I were given a glass of champagne. Kids made a dive to the iced water machine located in the lobby entrance (a machine which was to become a regular stop every day of our stay). Initial reaction to the central atrium was very nice following its recent renovation. Our room was excellent. Eventhough it was a standard room, there was plenty of space and had the benefit of facing SeaWorld. We unpacked and this is where we found the only fault in our two week stay. Storage space in the room can very easily get filled up when you have two weeks worth of clothing, especially when three of the four people are female, but this was a MINOR complaint. Once unpacked, we took kids down to the pool for a quick dip. This was interrupted by a thunderstorm and hotel staff were quick to evacuate pool for safety reasons. Kids are catered for in the pool with a selection of inflatables and also table tennis and table football. The energetic can have a game of tennis or basketball and at night a screen is setup showing films for the kids, even including the popcorn. Next morning we suffered the usual Europe to US side-effect of early morning wake up and this is when we discover one of the hotels little gems. During darkness the whole of the central atrium is well lit and it is at this time that this area actually looks it best. The hotel has a number of food outlets. Firstly is the Starbucks branch for those how fancy a coffee and muffin in the morning. The hotel also has a restaurant. We didn\u2019t eat here until our last morning, partially as it appeared a bit pricey but mainly as we didn\u2019t have the chance. We had breakfast here on the last morning and couldn\u2019t fault it. Kids eat free at the restaurant and this even extended to our 15 year old daughter (if only we\u2019d realised before). For those wanting something to eat during the day, or simply crashing by the pool the best location is the pool bar. Meals are about $7to$15 approx but you can easily share one between two (as we found out from the leftovers from our first order). The pool staff take your order from your lounger, deliver to your lounger and you just charge straight to your room (or you can pay). At this stage it might be worth mentioning that any UK guests who are also member of Virgin Holidays FVC should ensure they get a voucher from reception which gives them 10% of all food in hotel. Food is also served at Sports bar (steaks and burgers) and Sushi bar but we can\u2019t comment on these. Eating out around this hotel is a bit of a problem if you have no car. The I-Ride and Links buses to I Drive stop outside the hotel but the nearest restaurants/sops are located about a 15 minute walk from the hotel. Although this isn\u2019t far a good proportion of the walk has to be done along grass verges, albeit well worn grass verges to the corner of International Drive and Westward Boulevard. Here are Chinese, pizza, Italian, steakhouse and even a Subway. Not having a car meant that we had to take advantage of the shuttles services. The hotel runs shuttles using Mears to Universal, Aquatica etc free of charge. To book shuttle visit the Expedia desk located near Starbucks. Hi to Paul and Janette there who were excellent during our stay arranging bookings and rebookings when members of our party changed there minds, and even just having a quick chat. Three shuttles run in the morning (8.25, 9.25 and 10.25) to the parks and you can either book your shuttle back or leave it open for you to ring later. In addition to the free shuttles they can also arrange for shuttles to Disney. These are charged for unless you are staying with Virgin Holidays (you need to get a pass from the concierge desk). Tickets are also available from here. Although we didn\u2019t need any as we already had ours, talking to them indicated they were not the usual excessively charged tickets you might expect from hotels. To be honest for those going to Aquatica I\u2019d say walk across the road (literally!) to SeaWorld and take their shuttle. It runs all day and gives you the freedom to come when you want and go when you want. For Discovery Cove simply go out to the valet desk and they bring the hotels own car around to drive you across and they will collect you when DC ring them to advise you are coming back. All-in-all we had an excellent stay at the Renaissance. Would we go back? Well if my wife and children had there way we\u2019d be back there next week. The hotel is ideal for visiting SeaWorld and its related parties.

The location is convenient to all the major Orlando attractions. You can walk across the street to Sea World, or take a short drive, about 5 miles, to Epcot, Magic Kingdom, and other Disney parks. Cocoa Beach is about 55 miles away, but an easy drive. Everything went well upon our arrival. Valet parking is $16 per day, or you can self park for $12. We chose valet parking and they were very prompt with bringing our car around every time. We would call about 2 or 3 minutes before leaving our room and our car would be waiting. Check-in was fast and friendly and they offer a welcome glass of champagne. Our room was a standard King room without a view, which was fine for us, but you would have to request a view of Sea World if you want that. The bed was a little soft for both me and my husband, but we slept OK overall. Nice bathroom with double sinks and plenty of complimentary toiletries, and even a little Shamu bath toy! We did have an issue the first 2 nights with noise from the room next door. The first night we didn't call the desk and they were at it until 4a.m. The second night we called the desk and they sent security right up. The next morning my husband asked what will happen if they continue the behavior and was told they would be asked once to quiet down and failure to comply would result in eviction. We were pleased with how this problem was handled. Housekeeping did a good job. The carpet seemed like it needs a good deep cleaning, however. The hotel has a sushi restaurant, Mist, which was surprisingly yummy. The menu wasn't extensive, but the sushi was fresh and there were some innovative choices. One roll, I think it was called Tara's Volcano Roll, was so good we wanted a second! The pool area was lovely. There were lots of lounge chairs, although it did fill up on the weekend. There is a nice poolside bar and grill that has tasty food (sandwiches, salads and appetizers), cold drinks, and a friendly staff. The pool is large and clean and surrounding grounds are well maintained. The spa, Neu Lotus, is small but good. I had a facial and massage and was very pleased with the facility and services. Overall, we were very pleased with our stay. We'd recommend this hotel to our friends and family.", "Date": "May 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cGreat for business travelers!\u201d", "Author": "clarely", "ReviewID": "UR15815562", "Content": "Stayed here for two weeks on business, as my company's satellite office is within walking distance. First and foremost, the staff is RIDICULOUSLY friendly (someone has trained them well!) and helpful. Every single member of staff was personable with me, particularly the housekeeping and room service staff, which just enhanced my experience. Also, the rooms are HUGE. I wanted to do cartwheels down the middle, it was that big. If you are traveling alone or with only one other person, you will have ample space (even with kids, there's room for everyone to stretch out). The rooms are also clean, warm and cozy -- the color scheme is vibrant greens and rich blues (the scheme for the entire hotel is \"Under the Sea\"-like, in fitting with their proximity to Sea World). The food and general social atmosphere at the restaurants are excellent. Mist Sushi bar is PERFECT for business travelers/young professionals, as they have a fun mixed drinks menu the sushi itself is DELICIOUS. I tried sushi for the first time there, and found the fish to be fresh and flavorful, though I have to say the \"wussie\" sushi was my favorite -- the chicken teriyaki rolls are perfect for the raw fish phobic -- it's basically a chicken wrap, yum. All the food in the hotel, including room service, is done out of the Tradewinds kitchen, and that is a very good thing! All food at Tradewinds is fresh, seasonal and organic. Beware some pricey dishes, but the *quality* of the food for the price is unsurpassed. The fare in Tradewinds proper is healthy/fine dining, whereas you have to go to the Bar and Grill to get things like mini burgers, chicken wings and pina coladas... but just note there are duplicate items across all the restaurant menus, and everything on the room service menu, you can go down to Tradewinds and order. (that said, the service fee on room service is roughly $5 an order, but the delivery is prompt, food hot and fresh and the staff very nice) I highly recommend the Tradewinds salads! Oh, if you do the breakfast service, they are very prompt about delivering your food at the time you request! Transportation can be tricky, especially if you're not renting a car. The I-Ride shuttle is easily accessible for going to attractions on International Drive, and only $1 a trip, but if you are staying here and intend to visit parks other than Sea World, rent a car, or stay somewhere more Disney-centric. But for Sea World? Ideal location, best hotel you can get. Other amenities: gym is fantastic (and free!), with a variety of machines, weight lifting equipment and a daily yoga class. Several of the machines have TVs attached, with all the channel selections you get from the rooms. Speaking of TVs -- the giant, widescreen plasma HD TVs in the room are ACE. (randomly, also, the desk chairs in the room are ergonomic and so comfortable). I didn't use the pool, but the pool area is gorgeous, and I heard only good things about it. The Starbucks closes at 3 p.m., so no late afternoon coffees, but it's great having it there in the morning. Oh! And there are coffee makers in the guest rooms. The coffee quality isn't the best, but for instant in the room, it's pretty good! Also, the elevators are speedy, so you're never waiting around long for them, which is a plus (I waited AGES at the Peabody). CONS: probably the biggest drawback for a business customer (or just an internet obsessed person such as myself), is both the cost of the internet and the lack of wireless. \"High speed\" internet is $14.95 a night. I have high speed in quotations, given I don't find a 50KB transfer rate very high speed. I spent one night at the Peabody on I-Drive and their high speed was going at 300KB a second. BIG difference. Fine for checking email and doing general things, but streaming video was VERY touch and go. There is no wireless connectivity in any of the rooms -- so you have to use an ethernet cable, which means if you didn't bring your own 25 foot cord, you are bound to the desk. I'm someone who likes to surf in bed, so that was right out. There is wireless in the lobby area, however, so those doing conference stuff or just those who like to laze about in Starbucks will be able to connect on your laptops. This hotel was in perfect proximity to work, so it was the ideal hotel for my needs. The friendliness of the staff, and especially their understanding I was on a long term stay and not getting in my way every day (they only cleaned the room when I asked, but left me extra chocolate every day! :D), plus the size of my room and quality of the Tradewinds food (which I was eating twice a day), made up for any shortcomings the hotel might have. I had a room facing away from the Atrium, and found it very quiet, which was great -- there were plenty of kids staying there, and I barely noticed. There's a good mix of business/conference people and families, which was nice. If you're going to Sea World, on a business trip or there for a conference, I highly recommend the hotel. In general, if big, clean rooms, friendly staff and good hotel food are your priorities, it's a good fit.", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "SeattleDrh", "ReviewID": "UR15289877", "Content": "My sister and I stayed 4 nites at this Hotel and had a wonderful time.

I was surprised to receive a private message regarding my comment I posted on Trip Advisor, from a manager of The Renaissance, inviting us to stay at his hotel. He said he'd be honored to have a military family stay at his hotel. My husband called, spoke to him personally, and we were given a room for Easter weekend. We immediately cancelled the reservations at the other hotel.Upon check in, my husband was informed our room was on the top floor, facing Sea World. This would be perfect to see the fireworks from Sea World at night. It was. The manager also sent us up a hand written note with some beverages and fruit, welcoming us to the hotel, and told us to contact him if we needed anything. We truly felt welcome. We only had one minor problem and that was there was no bedding on the pull out sofa. We didn't open up the bed until late at night and by that time, housekeeping had left, so we compromised and used a sheet from the bed. The next day housekeeping made up the bed, so it really wasn't a big deal. As for the room itself, it was tastefully decorated, very spacious and comfortable. My daughter and husband played tennis and swam, though the temperature of the water was cold due to the time of year. My daughter received her Shamu, which my beagle now claims as his own, and it was nice to have the bed turned down in the evening with chocolates left for us. My husband was offered a drink at check in, but politely declined. The hotel was quiet, not the typical tourist hotel where you hear all of the people outside. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants because we were basically in Orlando to visit our son who is in culinary school, so we tried to eat on a budget.

I don't think that this is a 5* hotel though, i have stayed at many 4* hotels and this hotel compares equally. The rooms are clean, modern and large. As in some earlier reports they said of the front desk staff not being very friendly, i found none of this and found them all to be friendly and helpful.One word of caution though, as with alot of US hotels this hotel is very high, 10 floors in fact, and if you don't like heights as my wife doesn't it may be worth taking this into consideration, as it has glass fronted lifts as well.This hotel also gets very busy with corporate events, i didn't think this had a negative effect on the hotel i think it brought a buzz to the place. We also saw a wedding while we were there which was really nice. The florida gators american football team were staying at the hotel and also alot of supporters which also brought a buzz to the place, i got in the lift one night and 4 of the players got in, those guys were huge, i felt about 2 foot tall. Alot of long faces though as they got beat. I agree with the last few reports about the food in the hotel. The tradewinds restaurant looked quite expensive and i think you could get the same quality meal for less elsewhere, although the meal we had in the sports bar was nice the menu was very limited especially if you have children like we do. All in all a great hotel in a great location just let down slightly by the food options. On a personal point of view , if i were to go back to florida i would stay at a private villa with its own pool. This by no means puts a black cloud over the hotel, just my own point of view. I would have liked to have gone back to the villa after a long day in the parks and enjoyed a swim with the children and a glass of wine with my wife. But the main point is that i dont think i could face another burger.steak, chicken or pizza etc. as found in vast quantities in the parks, all my daughter wanted after the first week was an egg mayo sandwich, easy if your in a villa as supermarkets are vast and found everywhere, but not so easy if your in a hotel room.

I was a little bit skeptical considering that the hotel was undergoing renovations, but I am happy to report that with the exception of fewer places to eat than you would like to have, the property is fairly complete. Check in was a breeze. The front desk staff were gracious and accomodating. We were offered glasses of champagne which was actually quite good. We were in our rooms within 5 minutes of checking in and our luggage was brought up with us. The rooms - WOW. While not as luxurious as say a Four Seasons would be, these were absolutely some of the largest standard hotel rooms I have ever seen. The beds were comfortable, the room was decorated in lovely shades of blue and green and the bathroom was just tremendous. There is a flat panel TV as well as a good deal of storage place. You could stay there for weeks and not feel claustrophobic. Food - There are only two restaurants open. We ate in the sports bar twice and it was very good. Our server went out of her way to make sure we were happy. The sushi bar did not seem to be open while we were there, but looked gorgeous. Of course there is a full Starbucks on the property which we indulged in quite a few times. Location - This hotel is located directly across from Sea World and it is less than a 5 minute walk. They also have rooms with exterior balconies that overlook Sea World. It's a quiet location, far from the bustle you feel in the Disney resorts. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel.

The rooms have everything you need from cotton buds to irons, hairdryers and coffee machine. They are cleaned daily to an excellent standard. Like most top class hotels this one is excellent for those with disabilities with very few steps in the hotel everything is accessible, they also have rooms specific for diabled guests. The staff are very friendly from Janitors to senior managers, the food is excellent (although portions are massive) the breakfast buffet is must for everyone!!. The hotel has 5 restaurants plus a starbucks and gift shop (no deli which is reported in some brochures). Unfortunately the Atlantis restaurant and the Winstons pub were closed when we were there for refurbishment which does reduce your dining options within the hotel. For some travel companies the hotel offers free shuttle bus to all the parks, all you have to do is collect a voucher from the conceirge and hand this to the shuttle desk, bookings have to be made 90mins before departure though. If you get worn out by visiting all the parks then you can relax by the pool which is never very busy, there is also a pool side bar and restaurant which serves very good food. TV INTERNET - don't use, it's very slow and you can't get access to some sites however the business centre which is open weekdays 7am-5pm have internet access at 25c per minute, I went in there most days and it never cost me more than two dollars which is cheaper than the $10 for 24hrs the hotel charges for the tv internet. TIPS - Before you go on holiday join the Marriott rewards program, when you arrive you will receive a 10% VIP card for use in the tradewinds restaurant (food only) and since this is the only restaurant to do breakfast you can usually save around 4-5 dollars per day on breakfast alone. The I-Ride trolley is a must and there is a stop right outside the entrance to the hotel (very handy!!!) costing $1 or 25c for Senior Citizens it is an inexpensive way to travel. Pick up a brochure on board the trolley and this will give you a map of all the stops and also discount vouchers - my recommendation - go to stop 43 (premium outlets) take voucher from the I-ride book into the customer desk in the food court and they will give you a book of vouchers for the outlet shops. Seaworld is a 5 min walk, yes really!!!! PARKS - a lot of parks have now introduced fingerprinting at the entrance gates accompanied by photo id - so take your passports with you. DINING OPTIONS - we went to see Dixie Stampede which was very enjoyable, lovely dinner and very reasonable for price, you get a free souvenier drinking cup as well!! Get there early as you can see the horses that will be used in the show, there is also a pre-show event which is very funny.. CIRQUE DU SOLEIL - a must!!!! absolutely fantastic!!!! BLUE MAN GROUP - very funny, indescribable, stunning visual effects!! - beware though, if you sit in Zone 1 (behind poncho section) you may still get messy!!! BUSCH GARDENS - There is free transportation from seaworld bus parking area each morning but you need to phone in advance to book but as this is a local call is doesn't cost much from the hotel room (less than a dollar). Take a change of clothes as you will get wet on the water rides!! OVERALL TIP - BUY BEFORE YOU GO, if you can, buy your park tickets on-line before you go as this will get you the cheapest price (I went through attraction tickets direct and unlike some companies i received the actual tickets before I went on holiday and not a voucher, with the exception of the Cirque du Soleil) I would recommend this hotel to everyone and would definately go back........", "Date": "September 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent UK", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Nigelfromkent", "ReviewID": "UR8711500", "Content": "We just returned from 2 weeks at the Renaissance and I really cannot fault this hotel.

I was really nervous after some of the previous reports of building works, but shouldn't have been since there is now no evidence of any work.

I guess we are really fussy and I just had this thing about wanting one of those rooms with a view of the atrium. They didn't have one ready, but said if we went to get some tea and came back in an hour they would have one ready. Sure enough it was! The room was large and had a flat panel TV with Keyboard and Internet Access. There as a safe and fridge thrown in free of charge too. The bathroom had two sinks which was really handy of a morning and was well stocked with everything including bottled water. The papers were delivered everyday. Service? Well that was good too. One day we went out and forgot to take the 'do not disturb' off the door. We came in a 10pm to find the room had not been serviced (our fault really). We phoned down and within 10 mins the was someone there doing the full works. Also on the first morning the smoke alarm in the room went off - again we reported it and it was immediately replaced. That night there was a 'sorry' note in the room with chocolates on the beds. I guess my main gripe about the rooms was that I think there was a lack of storage draws and cupboards. Bearing in mind the size of the rooms there was plenty of space it fit them it. The Starbucks was a godsend, although it does get busy in the mornings, specially if there is a conference on, which there was a few nights. We eat in Tradewinds the first night, nothing wrong with it but you can get better cheaper outside the hotel. There was a sign saying car parking was $12 a day, but we were told this was waived for Internaional Guests and sure enough it was.

As far as eating out was concerned I was recommend Outback and Bahama Breeze for dinner, although they get very busy.

Its easy to find from Orlando airport, just jump onto the 528 until exit 1, turn onto International Drive for half a mile and then turn right onto Sea Harbour Drive and a few hundred yards later there it was. All in all it was about a 15 mile drive and took about 20-25 minutes. Just a tip though have some dollars or quarters ready as there are 2 x 75 cent tolls on the way. Parking at the hotel is also ample and you can choose from valet parking or self parking Walking into the hotel and it is impressive. The renovations certainly look good, from the waterfall, to the sports bar, to the secluded areas in the atrium, to the sushi and main bar. In the evening it looks even better and after a trip around a theme park my wife and I always enjoyed a glass of wine, sitting down in one the many seating areas - the tall backed wicker chairs being the best - very comfortable and a great way to unwind and rest those weary feet. The pool was also great for unwinding. Its a great size with lots of space (watch out for the geckos) and we especially enjoyed the large and warm Jacuzzi. It never seemed to be overbusy either. The staff were also very helpful except for one or two exceptions, beware of one of the ladies in the gift shop! On our arrival we got upgraded to a room overlooking Seaworld so we could see the evening fireworks and the reception staff couldn't be more helpful. The Conceirge were also helpful though I don't think they were as knowledgeable as maybe they could have been but with so many guide books about it didn't really matter too much. I have stayed in quite of number of good hotels around the world and I don't think this quite was worth the 5 stars, more 4 if I was honest but maybe this is being picky. The cleaning of the rooms was ok and they were pretty clean but in comparison with other hotels I have stayed at such as the Bellagio in Vegas, the Marriott in Toronto and recently a hotel in Venice it did not quite match up. The room itself though was large, with big comfy beds and a good size bathroom with 2 sinks (though the baths could do with being a bit bigger). They have safes in them, along with an empty fridge to store your cold drinks and other non perishables and also an iron and a hairdryer. I think they may have to improve the transportation side as the connections provided to the Parks were a little hit and miss. Indeed one morning we turned up to get our connection with Mears and though we had been told to be there at 8.15am the driver had turned up 20 minutes earlier and then left putting us down as a no show. To be fair the lady in the Mears office did rectify this but even she admitted that the Mears / Taxi drivers did not always know what was happening and a couple of times we had to help the drivers ourselves. If you did not want to get these connections there were always taxis outside and we found these to be better, especially in the evenings (going to Downtown Disney, Universal Citywalk, meals out, etc). I also had the feeling that this hotel was more catered for the Business traveller rather than the holiday maker and during the week it did get overtaken slightly by some conferences but you're in Orlando and unlikely to stay around during the day too much and it didn't affect us at all though. From previous reviews I have seen some criticism of Tradewinds, their restaurant. Though we did not go there, there were quite a few positive recommendations to go there from other guests who had eaten there. We didn't eat there ourselves as there are so many other great places to eat in the area and in the mornings Starbucks in the Atrium was a godsend and I think we tried nearly every cake and danish they had. Location wise the hotel is very central. Seaworld is only 5 minutes away, Discovery Cove only around the corner (the hotel provides a free ride to this), Universal and Downtown Disney about 10-15 mintes drive away and the Magic Kingdom about 20-25 minutes away. I would recommend getting a hire car if you can for convenience sake but with the taxis, Mears and buses / trams its not essential. As for tips on what to do, everyone is different but we really enjoyed Orlando. We felt the Universal parks were the best (do the Hulk, Spiderman, MiB, Terminator and Shrek 4D especially). Get there early if posible and get the best rides done first and if you can get the fastpass in Universal. We reckon it saved us about 3-4 hours of waiting over 2 days. Citywalk is well worth an evening visit as is Downtown Disney (but book reservations at restaurants at these places if you can). Disney is Disney and always good fun and if do want to move away from the parks we really enjoyed ourselves at Kennedy Space Centre and then Cocoa Beach. The best time though was in Discovery Cove so book this if you can as it was great and a day to remember. Eating wise, there is so much! But a special mention must go to Charleys Steakhouse on i-Drive, fantastic food, House of Blues in Downtown Disney and the Hard Rock cafe in Citywalk. All in all Orlando was fantastic and the Renaissance a great, enjoyable and comfortable place to stay and explore it all from.", "Date": "August 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cWhere to begin?!\u201d", "Author": "lou_pro85", "ReviewID": "UR8378315", "Content": "My boyfriend and I have just returned from our 21 night stay at the Renaissance Orlando resort and it was a huge disappointment. We spent a huge amount of money in booking this hotel as it was a supposed to be a 5*. I have always stayed at 3-4* hotels so obviously expected this to be of some improvement. Well unfortunately, it was a shocking 2* in my opinion. On arrival, the young ladt to check us in was friendly but we were given a room opposite the elevators which were very noisy. We requested to move to a room with a balcony, but they could not accommodate this request and so, we stayed in room 5001 for 2 weeks of our stay until they finally had a balcony room. The front staff were useless, they clearly chose to help guests in suits rather than the holiday makers which was frustrating when we were obviously struggling with shopping or our luggage. We had complimentary transport to the parks with our stay but this was a total joke. It was a company called Mears. The ticket office is located in the hotel and we had to book via them every time we wanted to go to disney. There was a young man called Sylvester who was very nice, but on other days, they had a dragon by the name of Barbara who was awful! No tact with guests, no knowledge of the parks, and extremely rude (we began having to dread booking out trips with her). When we actually booked out transportation, it was then a matter of Mears actually turning up and collecting us. on the first 5 days we were collected late on 3 of our trips. One of which was at magic kingdom, where we were left for 45minutes at 11.30pm. When discussed with the 'manager', they just said it had nothing to do with them and to speak to mears. Of course, when we spoke to mears, they advised us to speak to the hotel as they are providing the payment for our taxis! It was very much blame the other person in this hotel. We were often woken up at 12am, 1am, 2am by noisy guests which staff were not interested to hear about. My boyfriend and I do not regularly complain and we certainly wanted to avoid it on holiday but it was a matter of everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. I ordered a sandwich from the tradewinds restaurant and requested no tomato because I am extremely allergic, and of course, it came with tomato. No apologies at all from the staff. The food was expensive for what it was, and twice the bread tasted stale. (we only ate there twice!) Breakfast was $20 for 1 bacon, 1 sausage, 1 egg, orange juice and a coffee! Renovations are still happening which we weren't told of (see pictures). One evening we left our room at 10pm, and when we did, we found a squashed piece of pizza next to our door. On the way out of the hotel I asked for it to be removed. We returned to out room after 12am to find the same piece of pizza. Again, we complained (not what you expect from a 5*). When I opened the door at 7am to collect my paper I was not exactly happy to see the same smelly piece of pizza by the door. In the end I just removed it because it was disgusting. Things like this I would not expect to happen in any hotel, especially an expensive one. The feeling I got was that they have recently finished major renovations and not hired enough staff to return to full capacity. You saw plenty of staff by the front desk, but none cleaning on the 10 floors or anywhere being vacuumed or tidied. All staff were about 20. On the 1st evening we arrived I got mascara on my pillow and by the 10th day it was still there. I had asked for the pillow case to be changed on the 5th day as it was getting beyond a joke. On the 8th day I rang front desk and asked for it to be changed straight away. At this point, one of the front desk staff shouted down the phone that the sheets are changed every 3 days and that I was lying it had been there that long. As you can imagine, I was furious and on the 10th day, the pillow case was still dirty, so I had to complain to the manager before it was changed! All of this was running alongside our holiday which was really taking it's strain. I went on holiday to have a good time, not to have to chase up the hotel because they could not complete any simple task. I recommend that you do not stay at this place for over 2 nights as you begin to pick up on all the things they are incapable of. No staff became friendly with us, even after being their 21 days and speaking to some of them on a daily basis. There are loads of other things that occursed but I do not have time to list them all.

It's sort of like booking an inside cabin on a cruise ship. I didn't like it, but some people might think it's cool for people watching. There's also no sense of day or night in the room which could be desirable for some. We had the breakfast buffet at Tradewinds ($19 adults, includes coffe, tea and juice). The fresh fruit and omelets were good. The coffee and pancakes were not! In fact, I could not even drink the coffee! It tasted like the kind of coffee you get from a vending machine. Luckily there's a Starbucks on site, so you can grab a quick breakfast there as an alternative. I think young singles and couples would love this hotel.

They are at the tale end of renovating the place and it really isn\u2019t too shabby. There is a huge part of the lobby that seems bare that looks really weird; when I asked about it I was told that they were going to leave it that way because they used that area for the convention crowd. This part of the lobby did not offend my hubby, so it could just be my high aesthetic senses kicking in; it just seemed odd that they put two obviously cool and new restaurants so close together and left a huge area bare. There was a dance competition here during our stay but we did not find the many kids that were in the hotel obtrusive. They were everywhere, even the bars, but they just seemed to go on about their business. Over all, I\u2019d give the hotel a B-; the only way that I would go back is if we were just going to Sea World again, otherwise there are much nicer hotels in the area. Room Notes We found that room was a decent size and that the d\u00e9cor of the room was lovely. It had a nice sofa and chair in sea green and royal blue tones that was pretty to look at and extremely hard to sit on. There is a refrigerator but it was only for non-perishable food (I know, what\u2019s the point??) The bed was relatively soft. The television was a LCD television with high definition channels (I never understand why hotels will put a high definition television in a room yet most of the channels are blurry\u2026.). The bathroom was typical and the tub was small (or I my butt is getting fatter). The shower had nice water pressure and a nice shower head on it. We had a room with a door out to the lobby area which was nice in concept, but not in reality; it was nice to be able to look down at the lobby but it was pretty noisy with the door open. I give the room a B+. Restaurant Notes Mist is their version of a hip and modern booze and sushi bar in their lobby area that just opened two weeks ago. Nice atmosphere and giant LCD wall that played a fish tank dvd all the time. We went down there both nights that we were there and found the staff really nice and they made some of the best martinis that I have ever had. We had a really good time there both nights. We liked the waitress and the service she gave us. I\u2019d give it a B. Boardwalk is a sports bar right next to Mist with a lot of cheap modern furniture and lots of LCD televisions. Again, I question why they put these two obviously new restaurant/bars so close together when there is so much space in the room that is bare. Oh well\u2026 Anyhoo, we also hit this place both nights because we liked the atmosphere and found the food to be good both nights, drinks were inconsistent and the service was always bad. I\u2019d give this place a B- because the great grub was cancelled out by the crappy service. Tradewinds \u2013 On the advice of our crappy waitress at the Boardwalk we decided to hit their breakfast buffet for $19 per person. Everything except for the service was okay; my hubby had an omelet and he thought it was delicious. I had the mini waffles and they were waffles. (How can you screw waffles up?) The bacon and sausages was typical buffet fare and some of the fruit was ripe and some of it wasn\u2019t. They had some interesting things that I am not daring enough to try like hash browns with cheddar cheese, corn beef hash and cheese blintz. If I had a choice between this place and sitting in line at IHOP for an hour (which we did the second morning), I\u2019d be torn; I don\u2019t mind paying $20 per person for breakfast, but it has to be more than a C+. (BTW \u2013 the IHOP breakfast was twice as good and cost half as much.) They had what appeared to be a nicer steak restaurant which wasn\u2019t open while we were here so I can\u2019t comment on it. I was told that it would be opening in the next month or so. They also had a Starbucks that opened last week. We didn\u2019t go to the gym and only walked through the pool area which seemed busy even later in the evening. They had carpeted tennis courts which I really wanted to try but just didn\u2019t have the time to do so. Over all I thought that the hotel was pretty average in a city of some spectacular hotels.

We were checked in as soon as we stepped through the doors and offered a glass of champagne and asked which kind of room we would like - we picked one with a king size bed and a view over seaworld which was nice to see the fireworks every night! I asked if we had a fridge in the room and was told that we did not but that one would be sent up right away - one arrived within 10 minutes. The guest relations staff were helpful during our stay along with the guys outside the hotel who are always ready to get you a cab or welcome you back after a day at a park.

A cab to the I-hop or Dennys around the corner for breakfast cost us about $5. Breakfast at the hotel was nice, if a little more expensive than going out but the buffet has a good choice. There is a mears desk at the hotel where you can book tickets and transfers. We had transfers included in our package with Virgin and that was invaluable - most days we had a taxi rather than a shuttle take us to the parks as it was only us going.

From the moment we arrived I felt that all the staff were there to make sure my stay was enjoyable as possible. Check-in was effortless and I was told to address any further enquiries to guest services. Guest services couldn't do enough for you. I asked about i-ride trolley tickets and received complimentary ones for the first week of my stay. I asked lots of questions about where to eat, drink and enjoy myself and always received good advice. We were in two rooms on the 4th floor, the room allocated to my daughters was large, my wife and I were allocated a suite just down the corridor which was massive to say the least. Both rooms faced Seaworld and we enjoyed the firework display most evenings. The guys out the front of the hotel would do anything for you. If you wanted a cab they would whistle and one would appear from the car park. If you were using Mears transport to go to theme parks etc, they would make sure you got in the right shuttle bus! The only two negative comments I would make are that to eat and drink in the hotel was fairly expensive and wasn't really for a family budget. Also, if a function was taking place in the center of the hotel the noise echoed around the interior and could be heard in your hotel room. We love Seaworld, so staying across the road was a great advantage. Disney is about 15 mins from the hotel and Universal is about 10mins.

Since my husband was at work, I stayed by myself at the hotel all day. Since the lobby was undergoing construction, it was not a pleasant place to hang out. Also, the temperatures were extremely cold and I found myself shivering every time I left the room. For me, the workout room was the best part of the hotel. There were several cardio machines (treadmills, lifesteppers, recumbent bikes) with built in TVs -- just bring your headphones and you can access all the satellite TV channels as you work out. They also had extensive free weights and nautilus type machines so you could work out virtually every muscle. They had a separate mirrored room for stretching, complete with yoga mats and medicine balls. The exercise room was extremely clean and comfortable -- better than my gym at home. The pool was nice. There is an outdoor bar to order drinks (around $5-7) and sandwiches/salads (around $9-10). My only complaint about the pool is there are these really annoying small black insects all over the place. I don't know what they're called, but they're annoying like gnats, only bigger, and they travel in pairs, as if they are constantly mating. They seem to be pretty common in the Orlando area, and for some reason, loved to hang out at the pool. The room was very comfortable. I slept well on the beds, it was quiet, and very clean.

Being a regular stayer at Renaissance , I was pleased to have booked this place. However, this is not what you would expect as a deluxe hotel the niecities are few and far between . They are really not ready for guests here. They claim to be \"almost through\" the $20m renovation but its hard to prove. Where did they spend the money.? More than a few times , I had to call down and ask them why construction noises were waking me up at 4am or 6am and not the times they stated for construction noise of 8am to 6pm. The hotel is a bit of a barn with its huge atrium the restaurants and bars ( the ones that are actually open) seem quite vacant . More vacant of course is the service . They keep the temps quite cold in the hotel so expect to freeze in the public areas. Dont expect fining dining here. While many major Orlando hotels sport an upscale restaurant, this does not. You are greeted by many young men and women at the front desk when you check in ( they are all wearing trendy black outfits with ear pieces)giving you the sense that you might be in for great service. However ,In most cases count on having to call guest services at least twice for everything you need. The housekeeping is dreadful. Imagine a week there and they never ran a vacumm cleaner once. Room service is a bit of a joke as they are severly understaffed ( their claim). Families will like the empyty unstocked mini fridge though you will have to go shopping elsewhere for anything for that fridge as the hotel gift shop has very little to offer on the \"snacks\" side. The rooms as the advertising claims, are quite large though the decor is quite cheezy . I imagine they thought the lime coloured sofa blended well with the electric blue carpeting and yello painted walls. Duh ! The pool itself is not bad but don't count on good food or service at the grill restaurant. By the way, for those who think its walking distance to Sea World next door think again.

I was very very worried about the building work going on, but the hotel was absolutely lovely. The Atlantis and Tradewinds restaurants and bar are open as normal and at the moment they are just working on the bar right in the middle of the atrium. This building work is hidden behind in the lifts as you go in so we didn't even notice it apart from when we were walking along the hallways to get to our room. I did specifically request a room overlooking Seaworld and I have to say that if anybody is going here during the building works then this is a must. Some rooms look outwards onto Seaworld or the pool, while other rooms only look out into the atrium of the hotel. We didn't hear any of the work going on from our room but as soon as we stepped outside it was fairly loud. So you are well sheltered from it if you have a room looking outside, but I can imagine the rooms over the atrium could maybe be quite noisy. I would recommend going to this hotel once all the work is finished because it looks like its going to be even better. Staff were first class, despite some other reviewers comments, and always very helpful - especially the valet guys outside. We didn't take a car and I'm glad we didn't. We had free shuttles to all the parks so it didn't cost us a penny. When we went to Disney, the shuttle took us to the specific park we wanted rather than dropping us all off at a central point. Quite often we had a taxi as it was just the two of us! There is an I-ride and Lynx bus stop right outside the hotel so it was very easy to get to International Drive for shopping and eating too. The pool area was lovely and completely spotless. We didn't try any of the restaurants inside the hotel so I can't comment on those. Our room was absolutely wonderful. It was massive with a King size bed, sofa, chair and stool, dressing table etc. Double sinks in the bathroom and all the toilettries you could need! A bonus for me too was that they gave us bottled water everyday which saved me having to buy a load! All in all this hotel was wonderful.

On booking this holiday we were informed by the travel company that there was ongoing rennovations. On checking there website at booking it stated all work shall be finished 31st December. As we were arriving on the 27th December we felt that work would be almost completed. On arrival we were under no illusion that work would not be completed for a long time. I had read a ladies comment on Trip Advisor about this hotel in December and not to come here. I contacted the hotel who reassured me there was still ongoing work but it would cause minimal disruption and they booked us into a room on the 10th floor away from the minimal amount of noise made. On arrival to room 1057 the room was beautiful and we could see DisneyWorld from the room, all good. Then we discovered we were under the elevator motor which kept us awake most of the night. We requested to be moved which they could not do until New Year's day. With 2 adults and 2 small children moving was not a small task. We were moved to the 5th floor,(5007) the door did'nt seal properly and thus fore we could hear the noise from the lobby (Waterfall at night but not the end of the world). We didn't want to move again due to the hassle this would cause so we just got on with it. Then during the day the real noise began. There was jack hammering going on most of the day. You could not stay in your room during the day, the noise was UNBEARABLE!! There is no were to sit in the lobby and relax during the day so we spent our complete holiday whilst in the hotel in our room. This hotel that we booked in September was due to have work completed in December 31st and paid alot of money for as a 4Star hotel. When we spoke to Duty Manager Brenda Lasaari about constuction work beginning at 07.30 - 18.00 she very firmly told us that our tour operator knew about the work and it was there responsibilty to inform us. Fair enough, she looked up our package and told us we should not have been paying for parking so she wiped the parking bill. I went back to Brenda to try and get a contact number for our tour operator and she then asked why we had left it to the end of holiday to complain, I explained about the inconvience of moving rooms again with 2 children. She then informed me that I got a cheap holiday as the price was on the form I gave her. The holiday cost \u00a34,000 I aked her if she considered $8,000 a cheap holiday and she said yes and that if thier hotel was up and running we would never have been able to stay for this price. She then gave us 2 days vouchers for breakfast. This experience really ruined my holiday and I am really dissappointed with the Marriott group. This hotel is running on a 14% occupancy and was the only hotel in Orlando with empty rooms over the Christmas, New Year period. There is a very good reason for this. Do not go here until work is completed in April 2007. Don't do as I done and ignore these realistic facts.

We booked the holiday nearly a year ago even though there was work being done in the lobby we are glad we stayed at the hotel. Hotel The hotel is HUGE!!! At the moment due to work being done $21 million re vamp so there is only one resturant open - Atlantis. We didnt eat at resturant but there always seemed to be people in there all the time. There is also a small shop where you can buy drinks... Mountain Dew!!! crisps newspapers etc. Also a shop(DeLI) that sold Starbucks, muffins and cakes. Hotel Room The room was recently re furbished,massive especially for just the two of us. We were on the 7th Floor over looking Seaworld!!! We had a KING size bed (really comfy!!!!) with lots of pillows!! A 38inc flat screen TV with the american channels on ABC, Disney, ESPN etc. We had a sofa bed, table and chairs and also an internet connection in the room. The bathroom was really big and so clean we had two sinks!!!! and a large bath with a shower. We got lots of shampoo and soaps each day aswell as clean towels. We also got a little free shamu in the bathroom which was really cute. Pool The pool was massive with lots of sunloungers and a pool side bar the drinks were a little expensive however u always find this if u eat and drink in the hotel. Transport We came to Florida with Airtours as a package deal included was transfers to and from all the Disney parks and Universal with Meers.There is a desk near the hotel reception where you arrange transport with them. We noticed it would have costed approx $50 dollars a day to go to disney in a cab so I would recommend either take the free transfers if it was included or just go in the car and pay $10 parking at disney. Universal would cost about $20 in a cab. Itrolley is a good cheap way getting around IDrive costs $1 adults, free for kids under 12 and 25 cent for over 60's. We were so happy we stayed at the calmer end of IDrive as the main part of IDrive gets so busy and you cant even cross the roads!!! You can get a Free 1 day pass for ITrolley at Guest Relationations in the hotel they will also give you the time tables for the trolley which runs about every 10 mins from 8.30 in the morning to 10.30pm. Trips We went to the Seaworld Makahiki Luau. We purchased and pre booked the tickets with Attraction Tickes Direct on the internet.The show itself was fantastic however the food wasnt up to much especially for me being veggie!! There was spicy pork and ribs, fried rice with chicken and mixed veg. As u can see it was a plate of veg for me!! The desert was penut butter cake again wasnt really what I liked. Soft drinks were free all nite Coke Sprite Dr pepper etc. Dolly Parton Dixie Stampeed was another show we did which was fab!!! The show celebrated Christmas there was pig racing ostrich racing ice skating, dancing and of course horses... it even snowed!!! The food the show everything was brilliant. For those meat eaters you get a whole chicken to eat with your hands!!! u also get veg soup which is really nice loads of veg and an apple pie for desert. Also drinks are free in the main show including wine and budlite!! The pre show you have to pay or drinnks which were pricey $4 dollars for soft drinnk so we only had the one. Overall as you can see we had a brilliant holiday!!!! If you have any questions pls just email me jen4hatton@hotmail.com Oh ..... dont listen to the negative reviews - we were hardley in the hotel we were there from 10pm til 8am and the work men didnt start work til 8am to 5.

It was very convenient to walk back and forth to Seaworld and easy to get to other attractions and airport. I was worried about the construction but found the work being done at this time minimal. The only work I saw visible was tiling for the lobby floor and some drywall installation, none of which had an effect on my stay. There was no noticable noise or disturbances. I was alittle disappointed in the dining arrangements but saw that the hotel had set up a table in the lobby with drinks, coffee, danish and snacks. I wound up eating dinner at Seaworld Shark Grill every night as a result. The hotel was very clean, the grounds were well cared for, pool was very inviting, staff were friendly and accomodating. Thought the rooms were VERY nice - am accustomed to deluxe rooms as Disney and found the rooms to be comparable with Disney's Yacht Club. Double sinks, very comfortable beds, linen were high thread count and really enjoyed the soaps/shampoos (as the airport was limiting carry on containers). I would definetly stay at this hotel again. Decor was simple, nothing eye catching but comfortable. Check out was easy - on T.V. gift shop had plenty of necessities and souveniers as well as snacks. Submitting quite a few photos - really liked the hotel and would recommend and stay again. Gave it a rating of above average - though it is average for the type of hotels I book when staying in Orlando, I found based on the renovations being advertised, I felt the stay was better than expected so I rated it above average.

Just got back from a fortnight at the Renaissance Orlando resort at Seaworld. Thought the place was just magnificent. We booked through Virgin Holidays and had requested a high level room. They gave us one on the 3rd floor! The lowest floor for guests. This is my one and only complaint. The hotel has around 700 rooms centred around a huge 14 storey double atrium. Rooms can have either an external view or atrium view. All atrium view rooms have bacolnies. We had an external view room, overlooking Seaworld. No balcony though. The rooms were huge. Apparently the largest in any Orlando hotel. We had two Queen size beds, 2 Armchairs with a coffee table and footrest, a desk and associated chair and the usual TV and cabinet etc. Rooms have safes, fridges, irons, coffee makers etc. Beds were very comfortable. Rooms were clean and kept clean by the house staff. Ground floor of the atrium has an atrium, a koi pond, a couple of bars and restaurants. There is a playroom with video games and a huge, clean pool with bar (and shade!). There are also a couple of tennis courts. We had free transportation to the parks via Mears. They had a desk in the lobby. ou just requested a time for pick up and waited outside the hotel. In the event that not too many are travelling from the hotel, rather than send a shuttle bus for you, they send a taxi instead. All included. Appox. 5 min. walk across the car park to Seaworld entrance. A bit longer to Discovery Cove though the hotel will take you anyway, free of charge. The Trolley, stop number 38 is right outside the hotel and day tickets for this are alos provided by the hotel. Breakfast buffet was huge, though compared ro Ponderosa ect, maybe a tad expensive at $12.00pp. We ordered room service one night and was informed it would be 20-25 minutes. After 40 minutes it hadn't arrived. So rang down and within 2 minutes it arrived, free of charge! As can probably be seen, thoroughly enjoyed this hotel and cannot fault it. Highly recommended.

The I-Ride and Lynx Bus service are available outside the hotel on the main road with services running to all Disney Parks and Universal Parks as well as along International Drive. It is away from the hustle and bustle of I-Drive and is a calm, serene hotel. However, if you prefer to be located within walking distance of amenities such as shops and restaurants then this is probably not the ideal hotel for you. I would once more like to comment on the staff at the Renaissance from the bell-hops, guest services staff, shop staff, housekeeping and security. They were all so very polite and helpful during our stay. The only downsides to our stay was our first and only trip to the Tradewinds Restaurant. We arrived in the evening after a nine hour flight and an hour transfer from Sanford Airport. After settling into our rooms we decided to visit the Tradewinds. We were shown to our seats and then ignored for approximately 20 minutes after which we decided to leave. During this time waiters were clearing empty tables and attending other guests. Other a long journey we were all feeling very tired and this was not ideal. The price of food on this menu (which is also the menu for room service) was expensive. Overall a wonderful hotel with exceptionally high standards, wonderful staff and beautiful surroundings in a relaxing and tranquil environment.", "Date": "June 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boca Raton", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Travelinsider", "ReviewID": "UR5312821", "Content": "Nice hotel, great service, very good food.

Our room was not very clean nor was our bed completely made each night. It was like they stopped half way into cleaning the room. I found the food over priced, service at the pool bar area extremely slow and also a woman behind the counter was extremely rude. I found the grounds were not kept up and that the tennis courts needed repair. While walking across the court to retrieve a ball for my son I slipped on a section of worn out astro-turf and fell and broke my ankle in two places. Although the hotel states that medical assistance is available and there is a first aide sign posted, I could not get any help and had to WALK on my broken ankle through the pool area into the lobby toward the business center. At the business center I saw a hotel employee and I explained what happened and aksed for first aide. She said that they did not have first aide. I then saw FIVE additional employees NONE of which offered to help me. I walked/hopped from the business center to the elevator then to my room. I almost passed out from the pain. Once at my room I called the front desk and was told that all they could do was call security if I wanted. I didn't understand why I needed security so I asked about a hopital and location. My husband was not with me and when he returned he went to the front desk and they gave him a wheelchair with the foot rests broken off and direction to the hospital. I went to the hospital and found out that I had broken my ankle in two places. When I got back to the hotel I had a message from Security. I called and they sent a gentlemen to our room. He had no idea why he had been sent. I explained what happened and he took an accident report. He was the ONLY employee that showed any concern whatsoever. He was very polite. The rest of my trip was ruined because I could not leave the room. I couldn't go to the parks with my family nor leave my room. Only once did the hotel management call to ask if I needed anything. I missed the call because I was asleep. I called and asked if I could have a late checkout because it would take me longer to pack the day we were scheduled to leave and was told I could only have one extra hour!! Upon checking out the employees at the front desk were extremely impolite and at times rude. I never once complained about the dirty room, unkept grounds and tennis court, or the food prices. I then had to drive two days back home to Michigan. Now I'm home and have found that I have to undergo surgery to repair the damage. I received a phone call from a representative of the hotel and returned his call, he never called me back. Not very good customer service. The part that made the experience okay instead of terrible was that lobby was beautiful and the one security guard that came to the room was professional and helpful.

Imagine our disappointment when the rooms and pool did not match our expectations. The rooms were large and comfortable but quite shabby. Our major disappointment was the pool. It was dirty and the tiles were covered in grime. We immediately reported this to the front desk who said they would deal with it. They didn't. The pool was only cleaned properly after a chance meeting with a member of the management in the hot tub (also dirty!) when we had a conversation about the cleanliness of the pool before we realised who he was. He agreed the hot tub was filthy and went to check the pool. He assured us something would be done and it was. The sunbeds and tables were old, broken and dirty, not what you expect from a recently renovated pool at a five star hotel. The breakfast was fine when the waffle and pancake lady was present but no better than Ponderosas $3.99 breakfast when she wasn't but it was still $15. The bagels and doughnuts in the deli were surrounded by flies. The sunday champagne brunch is a must though. The staff were friendly and helpful and willingly made reservations for us at our chosen restaurants. Room service was efficient and the food was hot and very nice.

Upon mentioning the balcony room, I was quickly told that there was not one available. When I tried to explain, I was interrupted and told there was not one available and that balcony rooms were not guaranteed anyway. Of course, we were not told that when we made the reservation or the request. I accepted the rude woman's answer and just decided that it was not going to bother me. When we arrived at our room, we opened the door to find double beds. I told the bellman that there had been a mistake that we requested a king size bed. I called down to the desk and of course the same woman answered the phone. I explained that I thought there had been a mistake. I was told that there had not been a mistake. That since we needed an adjoining room for the kids that they could not also give us a king size bed. By now I am upset and we have only been in Orlando thirty minutes and I am ready to go home! I went down to the front desk to speak with the woman again to express our unhappiness. She did not seem to care at all. When I asked to speak to the manager, she told me that she was the manager. I then asked for a customer service number for the hotel. She gave me the number and I called from our room. The customer service rep. was appalled at how I had been treated and told me she would be calling the hotel. To make a long story short, the resident manager Chris (nice guy) tried to make amends as best he could. We were treated to breakfast twice and had cookies etc. waiting on us when we returned to the room the following night. I only wish he had been at the front desk the day we arrived and our vacation could have started off better. I will never stay at this resort again mainly because our satisfaction did not matter!

I only have 2 complaints about this hotel, firstly, eating in the restaurants is expensive, although the Atlanis restaurant gets a really good name. Breakfast was really overpriced in comparision to other 4* hotels in Orlando so we didn't eat there. They do have a little cafe area though which serves toast, bagels, filled rolls etc which is very reasonably priced. My other complaint is that they have no guest coin laundry - although I do not use this much, it is useful to be able to wash jeans etc. They do have a laundry service but it is $8 to wash and dry a pair of jeans (you would be better buying a new pair!) On the whole, it was a lovely hotel, very clean and convenient for sea world (5 mins walking to main entrance).

Who is this hotel perfect for? If Seaworld is the focus of your Orlando Florida then you will not do better in terms of the location than the Renaissance. They have the perfect location and once you've parked your car there (and yes, there is a daily charge) you can then walk across the street to Seaworld. If other parts of Orlando are your focus then this hotel will still serve you well although obviously you've got to drive to the attractions. If you're traveling on business and have a convention or meeting at this hotel you will not be unsatisfied either. This hotel is as good as it gets in terms of handling large business meetings or events. What makes this hotel special? For one thing the rooms were top notch. If you stay frequently at Renaissance you're full-service Marriotts you know what to expect. But this hotel seemed even better that others I've stayed at. There's a spectacular koi pond in the big atrium of the hotel. There's also a neat little aviary right in the middle. I got upgraded to the Concierge floor which perhaps favorably taints this review but that was an excellent bonus with a complimentary continental breakfast and afternoon snacks. There's a small playground for kids, a pool for infants and then a wonderful pool for grownups. I believe the big pool is heated. I saw plenty of people using it during an unusually cold December spell (Brits or Canadians, perhaps!) and no one seemed to complain about the cold. Checkin and checkout were extraordinarily efficient. Maybe it was the holiday season but they were offering glasses of champagne or apple juice to people as they arrived. All in all a great experience at this hotel. Savvy travelers can book this place with complete confidence. And if you're planning a visit from Europe or the U.K. you'll be delighted with this place. One more benefit. They have a tours desk at the hotel where we got amazing deal on on Seaworld tickets. (We paid approximately $42.50 for a day ticket which was good afternoon noon and then allowed you to come back next day!) Only complaint was the relatively pricey restaurants which were fine but no bargain (unless you're visiting from Europe in which case it'll seem like a bargain.
