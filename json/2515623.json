As others have written, the building has interesting features from its origin as a bank. Right next to the Vault Room is a fine fitness area with plenty of cardio equipment, a multi-function weight system, and free-weights. From this location it was easy to walk to shopping at the Horton Mall, to great restaurants along Fifth Ave, or down Broadway to the harbor and the Coronado Ferry. Each time we entered the hotel to return to our room, all the staff at the front desk welcomed us as friends. Put a smile on my wife's face. (You guys know how much that is worth.)

I agree with other reviewers that the staff was amazing. Friendly, helpful, and accommodating. The hotel is in an old converted bank that has more character than 99% of hotels. The room doors are even the originals and the meeting rooms are converted vaults. The location is convenient to most downtown places, but its a decent walk to the convention center or baseball stadium. We have a trade show in SD in 2013 and I hope to be at the same hotel. Rooms: nice and big, very comfortable beds, flat screen TVs, free wired internet (no WiFi that I noticed, but I was always working at the desk). My room was on the 12th floor and had giant windows with a view of the area. Value was very good for the area. Bathroom: nothing remarkable, but clean and perfectly fine. Service: From the minute I got there, everyone was friendly and did everything they could to meet my requests. I never felt like a distraction or ignored in any way. I felt like a valued customer. Location: about 1 mile from the convention center or Petco Park (Padres), tons of restaurants in walking. I didn't have a car (walked everywhere and loved it), but I think parking is somewhat of a hassle and expensive. Probably not much different than any other downtown hotel, I just very rarely stay in downtown hotels. Only bad comment on the location is that its sort of the dirtier end of the Gaslamp area and you should be prepared to be confronted by many homeless people. Some of the stores and restaurants in the immediate area are a bit on the seedy side (pawn shops, dirty little restaurants). If you walk a few blocks more, it gets better. None of this really bothered me, but it may not be what some people expect. Exercise room: I'd give it 4 stars. Far better than a typical Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn Express closet with some crappy 10 year old treadmill, but I've seen better. The machines were good (maybe 3 treadmills, 1 bike, all with internal TV, weights, etc) but the room was fairly warm even after I asked them to make it cooler.

The building is quite interesting because it is an historic building - previously it was a bank. They kept a lot of the architecture and it is beautiful. The rooms are well appointed and the hallways are memorable because of the architecture. The sub basement where the workout facility is was previously the location for the bank's vault and safe deposit boxes. The different areas were turned into meeting rooms - awesome!

The hotel really is great...lots of old character. Something you don't run into in your everyday hotels. First off, location is great, about a 15-20 ride from the airport. If you're interested, there is a bus stop that runs to the airport that is about 1 block away and it's cheap...$2.50. That will save you over a $15 cab ride. There are tons of great restaurants within walking distance. The only negative I would say is the hotel is located right next to some type of concert place. Each night walking back to the hotel, there were long lines of young kids and most of them appeared intoxicated and even witnessed one girl vomiting on the sidewalk. I was alone so I didn't care, but with the wife and kids I would have been a little apprehensive. Check-in was a breeze and finding my room was easy. Elevators were quick and there were several of them so I didn't have to wait too long for one to stop at my floor. The room was nice, but the view unfortunately was of the backside of the hotel so all I really saw were rooms across the way and the top of a lower level roof. Bathroom was spacious and appeared updated. Overall, I was impressed with the room. Business side of travel was also well done. First off, the hotel does have wireless internet so be sure to get the password from the front desk as it changed daily. They also offer wired internet for free in the rooms so I was able to do all my business work at night. The meeting rooms in the basement were nice, but the wireless signals were terrible. Everyone was pretty much relegated to checking emails in the lobby during breaks because it was extremely difficult to get a signal. Makes me wonder why many of the hotels I travel to seem to neglect wireless signals in their meeting rooms to their business clients. Overall, I was pleased with the hotel.

We first got assigned to 301, a mini-suite with the bedroom sharing a wall with the elevator shaft, and the living room a few feet above the noisy A/C units in the dark air shaft. We went back to the front desk, and got put in a room on the 10th floor. When we walked in, the lampshade from the lamp on the desk was sitting on the far side of the desk, as opposed to on the lamp. Doesn't housekeeping check a room before it is assigned to make sure it is all together? When I walked into the bathroom, it smelled like it had recently been used --- not pleasant, but by that time it was after midnight and we just wanted to sleep. The room was big but the old wooden furniture and the old wooden door were all a tad depressing. There is an eight-step starcase from the check-in desk to the room elevator, so not so good if you do not want to climb and descend stars with yourr luggage. We bailed before the $15 buffet breakfast,figuring that San Diego is such a beautiful, light and airy city, why stay longer in a dark place.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "bethesda, md", "Title": "\u201cWe'd stay here again!\u201d", "Author": "tikidream", "ReviewID": "UR123562249", "Content": "Earlier in the week, I was staying at another hotel for work for about three times what I paid a night at this gem of a hotel.

Nicholas in particular has an above and beyond personality! He made us feel comfortable with his sense humor and knowledge. Two other associates Ashley and Brandon were extremely friendly and helpful with my requests prior to and during our stay. The location is truly one of a kind. This building was formerly the historical bank, San Diego Trust and Savings. This Courtyard by Marriott has done a fabulous job by keeping the structural design in tact and actually embracing it. This is what makes this hotel such a one of kind. My father owns and operates a commercial and residential construction and development company. I couldn't have taken him a better hotel as he in particular took to the beautiful and unique architecture. I stay at many different brands of hotels. This is an example of why my first choice is to stay at Marriott. It is not just because I can stay on a more than reasonable rate, but because the service and environment are consistently amazing.

The rooms are large, clean and comfortable and from a higher floor have a pretty good view. As another reviewer mentioned, there is a lack of wireless but free LAN, which I am assuming is due to the thickness of the walls making it impossible! The staff at this hotel are phenomenal and this sets it apart from good to great. On check-in I asked if there was any pub where I could watch a rugby match which only started at 1230AM that night. The staff (sorry, don't recall the names) immediately called several bars and came up blank. However, when I returned to the hotel after dinner, I was called over to be told they had kept calling around and had also left a message in my room that there was indeed an Irish bar showing the match.

After being unable to make it stop I was given the room next door and told my friend could move over whenever they woke up and we could move our stuff in the morning. This was not the case - maintenance let themselves in before 8 in the morning and then the front desk told me I had to get up and move my stuff immediately or I would be charged for 2 rooms.

But we called that afternoon and they said a late check-in was no problem. The building, as others have written, really is quite interesting. It's an old bank, and they more or less left the ornate lobby unchanged -- ie, the front desk staff sits where the tellers would have been. Very cool. Also, the hallways on the guest floors look more like what you'd find in an office than a normal hotel. We enjoyed the vibe. The rooms themselves are fine. We had a decent view looking north, and while the hotel is in a busy area, there was no street noise. Standard double-beds, decent TV, fine bathroom, etc. Totally solid. The location is the major selling point. The hotel sits on the northen edge of San Diego's Gaslamp Quarter, which is absolutely loaded with lively bars and restaurants. Sure, some of the scene is a little fratboy-ish, but it's also fun and some of the side streers are very cool. The Courtyard doesn't sit right in the middle of it, like the standard Marriott, but it's also $100 or so cheaper. Seemed like a good trade-off to us. Good spot, good value, fun/funky vibe.

From the moment the valet supervisor (Stephen) greeted me to the front desk staff, they were all warm, welcoming, and professional. I have to commend them for their hospitality and upbeat energy. This CBM is not like others in the chain. It was a former bank and many of the architectual details have been woven into the hotel. The front desk uses some of the old marble teller windows and the hotel restaurant uses the high arched lobby as its setting. The vintage oak doors to the bank offices have been retained for use as the hotel room doors - definitely a nice distinctive touch. The elevators have classic brass doors, too. One little detail: from the reception desk to the elevators, there is a small staircase of 4-5 stairs. No way around it and it makes for an odd bit of ergonomics. Too many to fling your bag down but too few to stow the rolling wheel feature to carry. Being at the edge of the Gaslamp Quarter provides a good buffer from the noise of the nightclubs yet allows easy access to the nightlife. Valet parking is the only option - at $24 per day, it is not the cheapest but you have unlimited in-and-out privileges. Give the guys about a 15 minute lead to fetch your car and you'll be fine.

The hotel offers room service (which I didn't order) and does offers breakfast and dinner in the main lobby/bar area. I had drinks and dinner at the bar and the bartender was engaging and efficient. The bell staff was helpful. They have to be given that you have take a short flight of stairs down to the elevator. For those with early morning flights (mine was at 6 a.m.), be sure to book your cab the night before. When I'm in San Diego again, I'll definitely consider this hotel.", "Date": "April 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cLoved this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "SillySallyNewJersey", "ReviewID": "UR14484298", "Content": "My husband and I chose to stay here based on the location, we were very happy with our decision!

My wife had a conference in San Diego Convention center and she booked the hotel through her conference website. We did not have much expectation from this provided our past experience with another Marriott (at Biscayne Bay, Miami). We arrived a little earlier than normal check-in time (around 2 pm) but the lady at the front desk let us check in without any question. She also later helped us redeem a Marriott Gift card (for some reason it was not activated by the issuer). The room was clean, large and nice with free internet and TV. Our remote was not working but one phone call was enough to get it replaced. We didn't order any room service, but the maid-service was excellent. They took extra care to make stuffs organized. The parking option in Gaslamp Quarters was limited so we had to go with valet parking (a whopping $24/day). The hotel itself didn't have any parking lot, my guess is they park the cars a few blocks north of the hotel. Anyhow, the price will seem reasonable once you stay in that area. Most hotels charge similar. As others have already mentioned, even if you're not staying in this hotel, just peek inside to see its interior decoration in the lobby. You won't be disappointed. The hotel was originally a bank and they have kept the original tellers and original roof intact. The hotel is conveniently located near many restaurants (some of them are best in San Diego), trolley station ( one block north at 5th Ave) and convention center (20 minutes stroll due South). We were tired on the day we arrived and decided to eat at the restaurant at the lobby. To our surprise the food was really good (or it could be that we were really hungry :)). The price was very reasonable, although the service was a little slow. The breakfast was not as good and you can have better breakfast elsewhere. I felt this was the only shortcomings of this hotel. However, there are so many good restaurant nearby one might not want to stay inside the hotel for long. I suspect this was the only reason they don't advertise their food so much. One reviewer mentioned about safety issues near the hotel. We did not have any problem during our stay. The area is well lit and we walked in and out of the hotel late at night without any fear. So if you don't want to book a car, that's absolutely fine. The MTS and trolley systems are pretty good in San Diego. Yes, there is an adult store just one block south of the hotel, and yes 6th street has less buzz than the 5th but its not scary at all! There are many restaurants in the nearby area but I will just mention a few very close to the hotel. For breakfast try Sixth Avenue Bistro. They make the best French Toast in my opinion. It is located just two block north of the hotel and right next to it there is Mama Gucci, which is voted the best Italian restaurant for lunch. A few block south on 6th avenue there is Chopahn, an Afghan restaurant, known for its kabobs. In general you'll be very happy with the City of San Diego itself, the hotel is just a part of it.", "Date": "January 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, TN", "Title": "\u201cNice surprise...\u201d", "Author": "Southern_girl012", "ReviewID": "UR10841115", "Content": "The first thing I noticed when I walked into the Courtyard was the architecture of the building.

I went on Orbitz, Expedia, and Priceline and the average price was $379 this was high in my eyes but I figured I would venture away from the Starwood hotels that I normally stay in when I\u2019m in SD, so I called the hotel and tried to work out a lower price. Eventually I did.. I was able to get the room for under $200 and thought I was getting a STEAL for a SUPER luxuries hotel. Well.. I was wrong. As soon as we arrived at the hotel we walked over to HOB to ask the security guards how early we needed to be in line the following day so that we could get front row seats to our concert.. while talking to him we ran into some fans of the band that were spending the night in line to ensure they would get front row seats.. we overheard a conversation where the police were telling the crowds that the street behind them was the MOST DANGEROUS street in San Diego and that it WASN\u2019T safe for them to be out there overnight. We started looking around and noticed that there were prostitutes and druggies all around.. that area by the trolley is VERY bad at night and not so great even during the day. Apart from the surrounding areas I was also very unpleased with the hotel itself. The lobby area is nice and the fact that it use to be a bank is interesting but the rooms are AWFUL\u2026 I have never been in a Motel 6 but I assume that the furniture would be similar to what we found in our room. We had what was supposed to be two Queen beds but in reality they were 2 twin and a half beds.. 2 adults could fit snugly in them but not very comfortably and they were as hard as a rock.. I was REALLY missing the comforts of the \u201cheavenly beds\u201d that the Starwood hotels provide. When we checked in we tried to confirm the 3pm check out that was promised to us over the phone but a not so nice women informed us that she could not guarantee the late check out until the next day and that we would have to call in the morning\u2026 but on a positive note we only had rudeness on arrival.. during the remainder of our stay the rest of the staff was cordial. Valet is $25 which is average for the area, if for some reason you decide to stay here PAY IT.. you don\u2019t want to be walking around this hotel as a lost tourist. If you are young and looking to party I would recommend either The W or The Ivy.. if you are looking for a nice clean comfortable room in a GOOD area near Gaslamp and all other SD attractions I would definitely go with The Westin at Horton Plaza.", "Date": "November 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sun City, CA", "Title": "\u201cperfect location\u201d", "Author": "steph92586", "ReviewID": "UR10088366", "Content": "Spent Saturday night, October 13th, at the Courtyard Marriott in downtown San Diego, at the corner of Broadway and 6th, at the edge of the Gaslamp.

Everything went fine upon arrival. Parked right in front of hotel, valet was there, and so was a bell hop to take our luggage. Check in was quick and effortless. We were taken right to our room. Just had a basic room, with a AAA discount $189.00. We asked for the lowest floor possible and were put on the second floor. We didn't make any view requests. We had a view of the street and a few of the buildings across the way. The room was clean (and I'm really creeped out by cheap rooms, cheap bedding etc.) It was nice, bed was very comfortable, pillows and bedding were fine. Bathroom was clean, shower area was clean .....room was very comfortable. Also, the gym/workout room is very spacious, well equipped,,,,a definite plus As many people have mentioned, this is a great building. It was a bank in 1898 ( in that time frame) really nicely redone and preserved. Great atmosphere in the lobby, and tons of interesting features to look at, like the bank vault, the beautiful wood in the elevators, walls, everywhere. Really a nice experience just to be there. . As far as the area being \"seedy\", well, I agree with a previous reviewer.....you are in a big city. It's a typical big city. There are plenty of people out and about. We ate at the YardHouse, just a couple of blocks away. Definitely go there. Great Happy Hour, Great Food and Beers/Wines. The hotel is a one minute walk to the HOB. Really easy and fun. I would rather pay $24.00 to valet park, than drive around a busy city looking for parking. We didn't use our car the entire time. Everything is within walking distance. I would definitely stay again and would reccommend to other travelers if you plan on being out and about in the city.
