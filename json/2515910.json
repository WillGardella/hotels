Excellent service from every staff member and they all made us feel welcomed. The room was very spacious, clean, beds were very comfortable. The pillows (firm and soft) were a nice touch. Fridge (no freezer) can fit big container of milk and other food products, small microwave was an added bonus. Small coffee maker (1 cup) did not get to use it, hotel provides the coffee (special pouch) for it. Small safe in closet. Pool is clean and heated as well as hot tub was nice after an exhaustive day in the parks. Washrooms at the pool area are kept very clean. Some pool toys left by other guests were available. We were on the 6th floor (room 636) with balcony (chairs & table) with view of the pool and could see the fireworks at night and a random falcon on a balcony on the opposite tower. Had dinner at the Palms Breeze restaurant one night and it was very good with excellent service. Small Disney store on site with some toiletry items available. Exit hotel and turn left to Downtown Disney, it is a 7 min. walk with a very nice path with trees and flowers along the way. I have a daughter with a disability and this was no big deal for her to walk. Turn right when exiting hotel for a 10 min. walk to a shopping plaza with restaurants (Chevy\u2019s, Uno pizzeria and some fast food), grocery store (expensive but convenient) and for those from Ontario there is alcohol (wine and beer) in this grocery store, hard liquor is in the store next door. Had dinner at Chevy's for an excellent Mexican meal. Inquire at hotel concierge as they had 20% discount cards on meal. Also ate at Uno pizza which was good as well. There is a free shuttle that takes you to Downtown Disney and runs starting at 6 p.m. only and pick up is in front of the Pleasure Island sign. Free shuttle to all Disney parks is convenient. No shuttle to Universal so we took a cab to get there that cost $30 one way. There is a shuttle that goes to the Outlet mall at 10:30 and 1:30 but you must inform front desk to have it come by. We went to the Florida Mall for shopping, very expensive cab ride to go there (not worth it). This was our first visit to Orlando and we were very impressed by the friendliness of everyone we encountered on our vacation.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSuprisingly good\u201d", "Author": "Londonandrew007", "ReviewID": "UR129274109", "Content": "The Holidayinn is actually a suprisingly good hotel. Let's face it, if you're not staying in a Disney property, you won't have extra magic hours, and transport will usually be a problem. Not with this hotel (and indeed the others in Lake Buena Vista). They have a dedicated resort bus which makes trips to Magic Kingdom, Downtown Disney and Epcot / Animal Kingdom. The buses go by every half an hour or so, so you're not too disadvantaged by not having a Disney bus. If you want to use the Disney transportation system (useful during the morning / late night when the bus is really full) Downtown Disney is a 10 minute walk away, and from here you can get connecting buses to all the resorts (but not to the parks). But most of the resorts are pretty close to the parks: To go to Magic Kingdom take the bus to: Grand Floridian, Contemporary or Polynesian To go to Epcot take the bus to: The Yacht and Beach To go to Animal Kingdom: Animal Kingdom lodge. The rooms are very comfortable with a fridge, microwave and tv. The room size is bigger than some Disney resort rooms. Plus there is a good supply of towels and cosmetics in the bathroom. Coffee is provided. The Swimming pool has a great character and there's a good area to lounge in. You can also have your Disney park purchases delivered direct to the hotel for free. The concierge desk provides cheap-priced park tickets. So I suggest you check the prices before you commit! Now the downside... The fitness centre is really disappointing; it has several running machines and a dumbell rack and that's it. So if you want to excercise, I suggest enquiring at the Hilton (next door) to see if you can use their gym. Also, late night food is a problem. I was back at the hotel by 12.15 one evening and they told me they couldn't make any food after 12. This is a problem because there are no restaurants open later than 12 ish in the area. The nearest restaurant is a good 20 minute (and several complicated crossings) away in the area known as the Crossroads. It would be really helpful if they offered some form of late night menu. There is a small shop on site, but it was prohibitively expensive. A pint of milk cost us $2.40. Arguably the most expensive milk we've ever bought! Overall the staff are friendly and very knowledgeable about the local area.

The pool is wonderful for children as I never saw it empty, always were friends to be made for the little one. The rooms, halls, bathrooms were very clean, well taken care of. I liked that it was located IN Disney, but is a bit away from all of the hustle and bustle of the parks such as Epcot, Magic Kingdom etc. I like to be around the amusement park action during the day, but I also like to relax at night and step a bit outside of it all. MONEY SAVER TIP: Right up the street (where you came in at the light) There is a supermarket (Goodlngs) straight ahead where we bought bottled water, a styro-foam cooler for the car, milk, cereal, plastic bowls and spoons for breakfast. We would fill a bag with ice each morning on the way out to the car and put it in the cooler with a few bottles of water for each day.

We are typically a Disney World family but this time my husband really wanted to see the new Harry Potter attraction at Universal Hollywood Studios and I also wanted to spend a day relaxing at the ocean. So we flew into Tampa (cheaper than Orlando, especially during school vacation week) and spent a few days in Tampa and a few days in Orlando. To get my Disney \"fix\" I booked a hotel on Disney property but not one of the Disney themed resorts. The Holiday Inn at Lake Buena Vista turned out to be a very short walk to Downtown Disney, allowing us to walk over at night and browse the shops. The Staff: All the staff we encountered at this hotel were extremely nice. We were pleased with the level of service we received here. The atmosphere: The atmosphere was very average at this resort. According to the website the hotel had recently been renovated but we saw no signs of that. It wasn't in bad shape but, again, nothing really stood out to me as new or different; it was all quite average. The room: We had a standard room with two double beds, one bathroom. The beds were fine...after a long day at the park I don't typically have a problem sleeping at night. The bathroom was very disappointing. There was NO storage. The sink had an open bottom that was filled with clean towels and there was very little counter space. We stored most of our toiletries outside of the bathroom and had nowhere to put our clothes to get dressed after our showers. The worst part was NO towel racks other than the one where a bunch of clean towels were hung. There was lots of empty wall space so plenty of places to put towel racks but none were there. As a result our room was cluttered with drying towels. Extremely, extremely annoying! Amenities: There was a basic fitness room, a large outdoor pool and a hot tub. The pool and hot tub were clean and we spent a nice afternoon lounging in the sun. It was quiet, as not many people were staying there (as far as we could tell). There was onsite parking but the cost to park was $10 per day ($16 per day for valet). Charging to park at a hotel does not impress me one bit so that was a huge turn-off. The hotel also has an onsite Disney store and they sell park tickets. I believe there is also a free shuttle to and from all the Disney parks but we were not going there so did not use it. Dining: Breakfast was not included in the room rate (another thing I was not impressed with....at least include a continental breakfast!). There is a restaurant (called Palm Breezes, I believe) and they serve breakfast, lunch and supper. They also have an indoor bar area for a quick bite and a store with snacks. The buffet breakfast is $14.95pp and the continental is $9.95pp. The food was all right, nothing special. The gentleman cooking up the omelets was very nice. Overall this hotel was quite average.

There are a few supermarkets close by, within walking distance, Winn Dixie being the one with the biggest range of goods and most reasonable price. Walgreens pharmacy is close by too for all medicines and toiletries, they also have a small range of foods. For those of you with a car there is a Super Walmart a 5 mins drive away up Turkey Lake Rd. It is an expensive taxi ride and cost approx $20 each way in May 2011. Saving Tip - if planning to shop at Winn Dixie, when you go to the store register for a saver card, this entitles you to money off certain items and 2 for 1 etc on items. Definately worth using and it doesnt cost anything. The Holiday Inn is close to the I4 making it easy to find from Orlando International Airport, also very easy from Sanford.

Rooms had sliding doors onto balcony which alot of hotels in Orlando don't have. For me a bonus as i love to open these in the morning and get fresh air.

It does have a zero entry section too. Towels are provided. The toilets around the pool are nice and clean. Kids eat free in the main restaurant with an adult, however not in the bar or room service. It is the same menu regardless of where you eat so it is a bit of a strange rule. Good food at a decent price, good breakfast buffet options.

All the staff was so pleasant and accommodating but our biggest bouquet MUST go to Manney, Chief Chef and his crew. They were outstanding. Every morning we were greeted with such hospitality that it made the start of each day great. Manney never failed to take a few minutes of his very busy day to come out and chat to find out our plans and wish us well. As an added bonus kids under twelve eat free with their parents. On Saturday night when the Hotel was completely booked the restaurant staff ran their legs off trying to accommodate everyone and did a great job considering they were short staffed. The quality of the food was in no way compromised even under these stressful circumstances. My grandson left his DS case in the restaurant and it was taken to security and locked up until we finally realized it was missing. Everyone at this Hotel was so professional and caring right from Valet to the staff in the Gift Shop. They even sell Disney Theme Park tickets, same price but you can avoid the long lineups at the parks. The Housekeeping Supervisor, Josue and his staff were incredible and we \"THANK YOU Josue\" for going the extra mile on the Saturday night when our adjoining room needed extra attention.

The Disney Theme Park buses arrive every half hour at the Hotel and are always on schedule, Our biggest joy was finding the rooms so spacious and CLEAN with a fridge, microwave and safe so you don't have to carry all your valuables with you.

The cleaning staff were always friendly...in fact, everyone at the hotel was very friendly. The only reason I did not give a rating of 5 was because I found the buffet waitresses to be lacking in service. We ate there every morning so this began to irritate me. Once the hostess seats you, a waitress brings you one beverage then you never see her again. No refills, no plates cleared.So what would I be tipping on? As I said, this occurred every day. Every day I would ask for a refill on orange juice. If they remembered to bring it, it would come 10-15 min later. Perhaps the Holiday Inn could look at a self service juice area to avoid this issue. Otherwise, a fantastic stay. I would highly recommend it. Pros: Service of everyone except wait staff in restaurant was fantastic Friendly, pleasant rooms and hotel are clean, no wait times for elevators pool is just a basic no frills pool but my 7 yr old loved it Cons: limited menu in restaurant--look at eating out Laundry-aweful...try to avoid. $4.50 for wash, $3.00 for dry.

We did eat breakfast at the restaurant 2 days and got a to-go breakfast at the take and go area. They offered yogurt, cereal etc. It was perfect.

If you take the bus to the Magic kingdom it will take about 41min, thats b/c of the amount of stops and the bus drops you off at the monorail/boat dock to go from there. I guess this would be the same for any hotel shuttle, if you don't wan't to wait I would take a cab.

First of all, before we even arrived, Holiday Inn staff e-mailed me back regarding questions I had and I was a bit indecisive which view I wanted - whether I wanted the tower with DD view with balcony or a pool view was sufficient but also wanted to be nearby my sister who wanted the DD view in the tower - eventually Kelly helped me to book a 7 night breakfast rate for $139-149 rate/night with DD view with balcony during the busy President's week while my sister unfortunately who was not staying for 7 days paid a slightly higher rate per night with her AAA deal for same type of room. We were placed on the 9th floor and we had a view of the pool below us as well as the DD view. What's nice about being in the tower instead of the wing is that when you are on the inside, you can look down to the restaurant below. The staff is very friendly, always saying hello as you pass through, lobby is very bright and smells good. Check in was quick as no one else was there in front of us. Check out was easy too and they were able to make corrections as they accidentally charged us self parking fee when we had no car. I also was able to do late checkout by 2 PM b/c I was a priority club member. Guest services also helped arranged car service pickup to the airport. Cost of car service was $65 plus tip and able to use credit card for such. My sister used taxi that was metered and her trip back to airport cost $48 plus tip. Room/amenities: nice comfortable beds, refrigerator and microwave available, Bath and Body works shampoo/conditioner/body lotion provided, along with citrus mint bar soap and mint mouthwash. Rainforest alliance coffee and coffeemaker (not used). Rooms are clean. Bathroom shelf convenient - would have liked another towel bar besides the one towel bar and the hook provided. Nice flat screen TV. In-room safe a plus. Daily newspaper. Can hardly hear any noise from the other rooms. In room electronic thermostat - not noisy when A/C or heat is on. Used the pool one afternoon - it is moderately sized and heated - would have preferred that the spraying sprinklers were off on that windy day b/c it's cold to have water sprayed in your face - it's zero entry and goes as deep as about 4 feet 5 inches in the center. Also there is hot tub (not used). Towels are provided. It was never crowded. Also has fitness center and gift shop and grab and go food outlet and business center that we did not use. Food: buffet bkft was great - they make omelettes and Mickey mouse shaped pancakes to order, also the usual hot items: pancakes, toast, hash browns, bacon, sausage, corned beef hash, various cereals and pastries - I didn't always sit down for buffet but also can take items to go - they gave us 2 vouchers/day for bkft since I had the 7 day bkft rate and so only paid tip. We've also eaten dinner at the Palms Breeze restaurant for late night at 9 PM and the food was actually very good and reasonably priced, esp since the kids 12 and under eat free. We've also eaten lunch as well but had to sit in the bar b/c at the time we arrived, it was not busy so service in the bar to eat lunch was a bit slower but still reasonable b/c there was not the entire wait staff available. By the time we were done, we noticed that they did eventually open the main restaurant area for other to have lunch. Food choices are pretty good. Great option when we're too lazy to walk to Downtown Disney or when DD is very crowded. Definitely try the T-Rex (make advanced reservations), Earl of Sandwich and Wolfgang Puck Express. Shuttles: shuttles come about every 1/2 hour - supposed to come on the hour and half hour but hard to predict b/c sometimes they arrive 5 minutes after or even later. we are the 2nd stop with Hilton being picked up first and then followed by Royal Plaza and Doubletree suites. we are on Bus A. There is another Bus B that picks up 3 other hotels on the other side of Hotel Plaza Blvd. Most of the times, the shuttle buses does 2 drop offs to the theme parks: usually it's MK then DHS and the other bus goes to Epcot than AK. When dropping off to MK, it's really the TTC (transportation & ticket center) location which then you have to take either Monorail or ferry boat to actually get to MK. Other times, I've seen the buses only go to one park so it does vary. One time, Bus B also picked us up from theme park to go back to the Bus A hotels too. It seems that the buses are most crowded around the 9 and 9:30 AM times that sometimes it has to skip picking up at the other 2 last hotels so I think they have other back up plans for that. Pickup times at the theme parks are announced usually and pretty accurate. At times, I've seen the shuttles come to Epcot and then pick up from DHS before heading back to the hotels and not to AK so it seems which two parks they drop and pick up vary. Downtown Disney - the marketplace is about 8 minute walk with Hilton being the closest hotel to DD. They also have shuttle buses that go to DD starting at 6 PM but we've never taken such. At times, when we are already in Downtown Disney, we take the Disney transport buses to one of the Disney hotels and then take the monorail or buses to one of the theme parks so we don't have to walk back to our hotel to catch the shuttle. Plus the white Disney transport buses come more often at evey 20 minutes. Our buses are blue with a yellow oval that says Downtown Disney Resort Area so they are easy to spot from a distance. Overall, we loved our stay at this hotel and these Tripadvisor reviews did help me pick this hotel and I'm glad I did. I've stayed at Disney resort hotels twice in the past and in comparing cost/convenience - I think staying at the Holiday Inn was a better deal and experience - it's a moderate sized hotel so it has a cozy feel without feeling the crowd.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincoln, Nebraska, United States", "Title": "\u201cHoliday Inn = Excellent Stay\u201d", "Author": "Lucas_2020", "ReviewID": "UR125146080", "Content": "Had a wonderful experience at this Holiday Inn Hotel.

We reserved an ECV from Scoot Orlando for my father and the hotel front desk brought it to us immediately upon check-in which was quick and easy.

Overall, I rate this property 4 out of 5. Included in our room were the standards; mini fridge, coffee maker, microwave, nice flat-screen T.V., mini safe, desk and chair. A hi-speed wireless network was available, however we were unable to connect at any point during our stay. The WIRED hi-speed worked like a champ, however. THE GOOD... Customer Service - OUTSTANDING (5/5) I arrived late (after 10pm) yet front desk staff were pleasant to speak with and worked quickly to get me checked in. I was offered the 'package deal' for Disney/timeshare which I declined and did not feel pressured to accept. There was a mix-up with regards to parking ($10 per night/self and $16 per night/valet) as the Priceline.com website which I booked through listed parking as 'free'. While it raised a few eyebrows when I brought the error to their attention, the hotel honored the mistake and waived the parking fees for not only myself, but my daughter (who joined me 2 days later), saving us a total of $100 +tax in parking fees (Woohoo!) Super Comfy Bed! - 5/5. I love a softer bed, so a soft yet supportive pillow top mattress was a pleasant surprise. The bedding was comfortable and I liked having a choice between firm and soft pillow. The A/C in the room was a bit tricky to master, but very efficient (very cold to very warm in only minutes). Adequate Water Pressure - 4/5. Both my daughter and I have long, thick hair, so this is a big issue for us. Water pressure on the 10th floor was sufficient for washing our hair without too much fuss. Bathroom Storage - 5/5. I'd read reviews stating limited shelf/counter space in the bathroom, however I found the wall shelves behind the door more than adequate for my plethora of haircare items! There is only one hook, so I ended up using clipper-hangars to hang my towels to dry (or leave them on the floor and housekeeping will replace daily). Interior Atrium - 5/5. Very nice! The glass elevators made for a stunning ride up and down from our 10th floor room. We were located quite near the elevators, yet never heard any noise. Exterior Noise - 4/5. While I-4 was just outside our window, the noise was minimal. Both of us are light sleepers and it was not loud enough to prevent us from falling asleep or wake us up. It is noticeable, but not a nuisance. Easy Access - 5/5. There are MANY hotels on Hotel Plaza Blvd and not all of them are easy to access. Holiday Inn is located at a LIGHT, which makes entry/exit a breeze. Fun/Functional clock radio - 5/5. Has a nightlight (which can be turned OFF) and a plug for MP3 devices. Little things, but I thought they were nice touches. THE BAD... Balcony - 3/5. We had a lovely balcony with a table and 2 chairs, perfect for a cup of coffee in the morning or enjoying the night air in the evening...too bad it faced I-4. The road is busy (read NOISY) 24/7, so while the balcony looked inviting, it was never used our entire stay. Access to Hotel Plaza Blvd - 2/5. While not Holiday Inn's fault, access to HPB is a nightmare if going in blind. TIP - If coming from I-4 Westbound (North), use the INSIDE of the two exit lanes to make that right turn. The left turn onto HPB is about 100 yards down. Without exception, each time I traversed this section of road, there were at least 8-10 cars attempting to cross 3 lanes of traffic to get into the left turn lane onto HPB. Shuttle Service to the parks - 3/5. Free is free and while I can't really argue the quality of a free service, I will anyway. Route A picks up Hilton, Holiday Inn, Royal ??? and DoubleTree (in that order). We were always able to get on the bus, however seating was unavailable all but two times (and we are only the 2nd pick-up). Coming home in the evening was even more chaotic with large groups of people jockying for a spot on the bus. They do seem to have additional buses in the evening, to offset the high demand as it was only about a 25 minute time lapse between the first, second and third bus. This is off-season and it was still a headache. I would be wary of depending on shuttle service during peak season (summer months). THE DISAPPOINTING... Holiday Inn is ON Walt Disney World property, however IT IS NOT A WDW RESORT. This may not be a big deal for some, but for us, we were really looking forward to utilizing the Extra Magic Hours (extended park operating hours available only to resort guests). The Magic Kingdom was open an additional 3 hours our first night, however we were unable to take advantage because I didn't know Holiday Inn wasn't included until it was too late. The Hilton (next door) IS a WDW Resort and DOES get passes/access to EMH if that is something you are looking for.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Moody,B.C.", "Title": "\u201cAwesome staff and very clean hotel\u201d", "Author": "Marguerite D", "ReviewID": "UR121871602", "Content": "All the staff are very friendly and Spencer went above and beyond to help us get 3 rooms together on very short notice.

Had the freedom from fees package which included no fees for parking and 2 free breakfasts a day or 8 coupons to use your way. Breakfast was an all you can eat breakfast bar which included a made to order omelet station and mickey waffles. Breakfast was delicious. My only complaint was on Sunday that they only had one server at the omelet bar and there was a line of 7 people all staring at the poor server as she tried to prepare each omelet and waffles as timely as she could. They need will need to provide at least 2 servers for the weekend crowd. Many customers were giving the woman a hard time and I get bad for her.

The shuttle can get crowded especially with the strollers, but they were on time and beats paying $14.00 a day to park at the parks.

We arrived to find our A/C not working properly and within a matter of minutes we were given an upgrade (free of course) to a Downtown Disney view on the 11th floor. That was very nice of them. (I had purchased the pool view on the 6th floor.) The view was nice and watching the fireworks was nice (but every night?)... too me not worth the extra money every night...go with the cheaper room but not the rooms facing I-4! The pool view would have been fine. There is traffic noise from I-4 with the upper floors but not when the door is closed. The room was decent and the beds very comfortable. Fridge was nice to have for leftovers and drinks. Nice too have balconies too to dry off clothes! Purchased package to get breakfast buffet every morning. It was worth it. The buffet had eggs, bacon, french toast, pancakes, home fries, grits, hash, cereal, toast, muffins, oatmeal, and fresh fruit!!! Plus an omelette and waffle station. What else more could you want every morning? The food was good...not great. The dinner food was good...not great. However...the prices were decent and kids eat free was nice. My kids tend to only eat chicken nuggets, hamburgs, grilled cheese and mac/cheese anyways! Do not get me wrong the dinner food was good...I liked the burger, chicken parm, turkey club, and pizza. My steak was very good but it took awhile to get it cooked right. The manager immediately told me that my meal was free because it took so long! My wife wished they would change the menu up because there is only a set list to choose from. The staff are all very nice and are there to help. The bell/valet's set me up with a taxi to get to Universal...expect about $30 one way. The pool was a very nice feature and my kids were in it every night! Very warm and relaxing. You can purchase Disney tickets right there in their store. The give you a paper every moring at your door for free. The buses were very easy to use and were there on time. You just need to make sure it says \"A\" and it has the Holiday Inn sign on it. You do not need the bus to Downtown Disney because it is less than 10 minute walk! Also there is a grocery store about a 20 min walk where we got food for our lunches for Disney. The bar had good drinks and there are two computers to use for checking stuff online or printing out tickets (airlines/parks.)

An additional \"bonus\" for our first night was a planned electrical shut-off at 1:00 AM that lasted several hours and further complicated that fact that there was no air conditioning. Also, if you choose to stay here (I don't know why anyone would with so many other options), be aware that when you reserve a room with two queen-size beds, the beds are in no way \"queen size\". This was one of the reasons we chose this property instead of a Disney value-property which was the same price per night, but only offered double-beds. Hot water is hard to come by as well. If your family is going to shower in the morning, get up and showered early if you want everyone to have a chance for lukewarm water. This is truly the first time that reviews on Trip Advisor has led me astray. I have used the reviews for restaurants, hotels, and sight-seeing reviews all over the world and have always found the reviews to be helpful and honest assessments of a property or tourist site. I seriously question the authenticity of the reviews for this property making it the #10 hotel in Orlando. The staff seems very skilled in telling customers that they are \"sorry\" for any guest issue that arises. They don't have the desire or skills necessary to resolve issues in a positive manner. Their smile and apology seems very disingenuous. The fact that no one even asked how our stay was at check out leads me to believe that they would prefer not to hear about it. To end on a positive note, I will say that the housekeeper for our room did an outstanding job.

For the latter I would say this was definitely true - you will pay a fraction of the cost of other hotels actually on the resort site. The reason is because you get in effect what you pay for - and you get a 3* facility despite the impression given by several of the over-enthusiastic reviewers. For the former, I am still at a loss as to where the astronomical sums of refurbishment money went. The lobby is functional but uninspiring, rooms are standard fare and not spacious, eg our room was a double queen and could not even accommodate a 2-seater couch, moreover we were forever tripping over our 4 suitcases. There is just one suite on the property. The bathrooms are clean and the granite countertops make them a pleasure to use. However, I have long since come to expect fluffy robes and slippers as a standard offering of the higher class of hotel. Neither was available here. This is disappointing (as robes are far too bulky to carry around with you). Hotel amenities are relatively sparse - however the games room and pool will keep the kids occupied if (heaven forbid) it is raining. No complaints re breakfast. Having said all that though, if the purpose of your hotel stay is solely functional as you will be spending almost all of your waking hours (and $$) at Disney and you are looking for a no-frills but comfortable place to rest your weary head, then this IS good value for money. We were hoping for more hotel ambience to add the extra special touch to our first time trip - and if this is you too - try elsewhere!

If you want to go from any of the parks to Disney Downtown, take the same shuttle bus and get off at Hilton, I think this is faster than what Disney recommends is to take a bus to a nearby Disney resort and then another bus to Disney Downtown, since there are no buses from any of the theme parks to Disney Downtown directly. Back to the hotel, the room is spacious and clean, the free Internet is bonus. We tried the breakfast, although the buffet is more value for money, ala carte is better quality. If you can get a rate under $100, this is a great hotel compared to any of the Disney resorts. Even the budget hotels can not compare with this price. I don't think Magic hours provided by other Disney hotels is very useful for people staying multiple days, because you get enough after 5-7 hours in the parks everyday. I recommend getting a Disney gift card to use in the park, for 4 days, we did not use any cash. We only needed cash to pay for cab rides to Premium Outlet, which the fare is $12 including tips.

The restaurant is open and kind of feels like your eating in the Lobby. Another reason no 5* from me. Also we went the Labor Day Weekend and once the crowd left it was great. The pool was practically all ours. Pay a couple bucks more and get pool view, it's worth it.

We made sure that we told the front desk as I didn't want them to think our children did it. The next day we left for the park and came back at 3:30 pm. The room was not made up. I called down to the front desk and they apologized and said they would send someone right away. We went for a swim and came back and it was done. The next day we got back to our room at 4pm and it was not made up again. We called again to the front desk and they apologized again and said they would send someone right away. We went for a swim came back and it was still not made up. The manager apologized and offered us dinner at their restuarant. We already had plans for dinner so he offered to reduce our room rate for 1 night. When we got back from dinner the room was made up but the maid didn't dust or clear used glasses in the room. The hotel was not busy so we couldn't understand why this was so lack. The hotel staff was good at handling it but there was obviously a problem with housekeeping. We moved to another resort for the rest of our stay in Orlando. Orange Lake Resort Holiday Inn. I will leave another review there. I am happy with our choice of hotel even with the house keeping mishap. It was close to downtown disney which was great. I agonized over the right hotel for our 1st trip to Disney.

Here the price included all the \"extras.\" The location in my opinion was the best of all worlds. A short drive down a scenic road to the Disney parks and quick drive to Downtown Disney. In my opinion, \"staying in the park\" is all hype and from what I saw those resorts were far away from Disney but at the same time totally isolated. And of course very expensive! As for the Holiday Inn, the hotel was very nice. The pool amazing, and much more impressive than the pictures. The restaurant was very pleasant for breakfast, although the food was not great in the evening. Note: We did not find any great meals in Orlando. The hotel structure itself is old and has been remodeled. The rooms were nice and the elevators efficient. My only gripe was that the bathrooms were so small it was hard to access any of your toiletries. Also there were no hooks to hang anything. Beds were also on the soft side. The Downtown Disney hotel area was a pleasant surprise. I had assumed it would be an urban area, but actually it is a very nice grassy boulevard. The hotels are all in a row on both sides of this road. Our parking lot was back to back with the Hilton, which would have been much more expensive with all the fees.

I was definitely not disappointed when I got to the hotel. Firstly, the location is absolutely ideal. It is only a 10 minute walk to Downtown Disney and there are other hotels nearby that are great for dinner and a supermarket a short walk in the opposite direction. The hotel also runs free shuttle buses to the disney parks and these are really convenient and much better than the overcrowded disney buses. Universal is a 15 minute ride away in a taxi which only costs about $30 to get there. Secondly the staff in the hotel are fantastic. The man who checked us in was very friendly and when I asked for later check out this was not a problem. The staff in the bar and the restaurant were also extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them. Finally, the hotel itself is also fantastic. The room we had was on the 14th floor and was amazing with extra room and two large king size beds. The view from our room was of the pool (also great and never overly busy) and also Downtown Disney. We also saw the fireworks from Epcot if we were in the room at around 9pm. The restaurant and bar serve really tasty food and there is a small self serve section where you can buy drinks, pastries etc most of the day. My only criticism and this shouldn't take away from my positive comments above is that some days the room was serviced late in the afternoon and twice it wasn't cleaned at all. However, as soon as I contacted the Front Desk they sent someone up asap. All in all a fantastic hotel, in a great location with very friendly staff. :-)", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Myers, Florida", "Title": "\u201cClose To Disney Parks -- Less Expensive Than Most \"Inside The Park\" Disney Hotels\u201d", "Author": "rockdrums", "ReviewID": "UR116173639", "Content": "Hotel is located just outside of the actual Disney Parks, but is extremely close.

We stayed at the hotel based on the reviews and all walked away feeling underwhelmed.

First, while we had originally planned to take advantage of the shuttles we decided at the last moment to rent a car to make it easier to get four adults and three children back and forth in a timely fashion. The hotel charges $10 a day to park your car - not valet, just the right to park your car in a lot that seemed to have plenty of open spaces. Second, the hotel seems to market itself as a Disney member and while we weren't expecting the levels of amenities one gets from an official Disney hotel, I do think we were disappointed at the level of service. There is a desk in the lobby to provide info on Disney World. Great, right? Except that EVERY question we poised got a curt, confused, or befuddled response. Do you have info on the attractions at Animal Kingdom? Nope (delivered in a bored, please go away manner). Which parking lot would be best for eating at the T-Rex restaurant in Downtown Disney? I don't know, I think I have a map. (seriously confused young woman, who while pleasant seemed as knowledgeable as my 6 year-old). Third, walking distance to Downtown Disney??? Really??? Are all you people writing this coming from Manhattan??? It's summer, it's hot, three tired and whiny kids. No I don't think that's a walk I'd advise every night. Do-able, but I don't think it's a selling point for real. In summary, there's nothing wrong with the hotel but I think that people are better off viewing it as a run-of-the-mill Holiday Inn. We all agreed on our way to the airport this morning that all things being equal we'd have probably got the same service at a hotel in Kissimmee.

While I did miss the novelty of AKL, this hotel was perfectly adequate if you want a clean, safe place to sleep at night that's not too far from attractions. The rooms were nicely updated and clean. We did come back to the room one afternoon to find that all the toilet paper had been taken by housekeeping. Not sure what that was about, but they brought 2 more rolls soon after I placed a call to the front desk. We had a pool view room with balcony which was a nice, large balcony with a small table and chairs. It felt kind of weird looking at the other balconies across the pool with people sitting on them looking right back at you. The buildings were a little too close, IMO to have them facing each other. I wasn't crazy about our room location either because we were in the wing building in the room at the very end. It was quite the trek at the end of the day. Luckily, we had laundry facilities on our floor, although you have to go the 4th floor to get detergent. I think it would be pretty easy to put detergent machines in each laundry room. We ate at the buffet each morning, and I thought it was decent. Would've been better if free, but that ain't gonna happen in the Disney area. I loved that the kids ate free though! That was a big money saver, especially since I have to force mine to eat anything in the morning. The walk to Downtown Disney was easy and convenient. We ate at Fulton's Crab House the first night, which I found to be extremely overpriced with limited selection and bland food. Wish I'd just gone to Capt. Jack's instead. We only used the shuttle buses on one day, since we went to Universal the rest of the time. The ride there was fine, although a bit crowded with standing room only by the time it left our hotel. The bus to go back to the hotel at the end of the day was 20 minutes late with no explanation or apology from the driver. We'd already gotten there 25 minutes before the bus was scheduled to arrive, so we waited 45 minutes for the, once again, standing room only bus to arrive. The only other gripe I have is that we asked valet to call us a cab to take us back to the airport on our last day. He called a shuttle, which I really don't know if there's a difference, but it was $65 one way to the airport. I didn't expect it to be that much, and am not sure if a cab, which I'd requested, would've been cheaper. All in all, the hotel is clean, convenient, and very reasonably priced.

We are both mid to late twenties. We stayed on the top floor and in room 1401. I initially looked for us to stay here because I had previously stayed here prior to the building being closed due to hurricane Katrina. The hotel is based on Hotel Plaza Boulevard; it is a 10 minute walk (maximum) to Downtown Disney and in the opposite direct 15 minutes to the Crossroads complex. DTD has lots of restaurants and Disney themed stores. DTD can get pretty busy for eating, it\u2019s probably best to go relatively early or then wait for the rush to decline to minimise wait times. The crossroads has a 24 hour supermarket, crazy golf (great fun) and many very reasonable restaurants. We booked to stay here via Florida4less and felt we got a good deal. On arrival we were impressed with the reception areas modern decor and the friendliness of the front desk staff. Check in was quick and hassle free. Our room was very spacious. We were facing the I4 and initially concerned the road noise would keep us awake. Fortunately it did not however, a lighter sleeper may struggle. The road noise was prominent in the background but did not cause us any problems. The room had 2 queen beds, HD TV, mini fridge, desk and an armchair. We felt the storage for clothes could have been a fraction bigger. The bathroom was spacious and had a very convenient cubby hole behind the door to store wash bags etc. The hair dryer was excellent and I\u2019d recommend you leave yours at home to save the luggage weight. I didn\u2019t use mine once! The only very minor point worth making is that we felt the cleaning standard / regime seemed questionable at times. There was some dust and marks on surfaces etc and upon our final room check before leaving we found a receipt under the bed from 3 May (5 days before we arrived!!). The beds were made / changed and clean towels so we weren\u2019t overly fussed and didn\u2019t see it as a huge problem but think it\u2019s worth mentioning. The pool is very nice and large. There are plenty of loungers and towels available but limited parasols for people who like shade. A plus is the pool fountain to drain out any road noise. The pool is open late too. The front desk staff are excellent and very helpful. The day before our departure we planned to check in our flight on line but the business centre was down. They allowed me to use their front desk computers free of charge to check in without a hint of inconvenience. There is a complimentary bus to all Disney parks that runs every 30 minutes. Getting to the park it\u2019s great but can seem to take a longer period of time to get home. Tip - the water park bus only collects you at 4 and 5 so if you want to leave earlier you can catch the Disney transportation to Saratoga Springs. If you get off the stop titled Congress park it is a short walk to DTD and the hotel. Quite frequently the Saratoga Springs bus does also stop off a DTD so always worth checking with the driver. There is a bus stop 5 minutes away from the hotel where you can catch the 55 to Seaworld (20 minutes) or 111 to the airport (50 minutes) for $2 pp. The hotel is a 20 minute cab ride to Universal (about $25 each way) - tip order a Mears cab and do not use Star that have slots outside the hotel. Our single journey with Star was not enjoyable (poor control of bodily functions and appalling driving!). Overall we had an amazing holiday in Orlando and great stay in the Holiday Inn.

However, I just wanted to give folks the heads up that if you pay extra for a balcony room with view (of pool or Downtown Disney), they also consider a ground-level patio to be a \"balcony.\" So if you truly want a \"view,\" you must talk to someone before you get there to ensure that you are getting what you want. They did change our room, after putting us in a room with a patio, but first tried to convince me that it was the balcony that I had paid extra for.

The view of the pool was beautiful, the room was quiet to extraneous noises, the bed was extremely comfortable and the in-room coffee and coffee maker were among the best I've ever had period. Oh, and let me not forget the wide-screen HDTV - a real treat for those of us still tied to the tube. Our one visit to the dining room was fabulous, although pricey at $40 for breakfast buffet for two, juice and coffee. The waiter was politely pleasant, and the omelette, prepared on the spot for you by a world-class omelette-maker made it quite worth the price. The bartender, with a quite empty bar, was attentive and quick to recommend an alternative wine when the ordered wine was not in stock. Where the hotel fell short was in the housekeeping department -- and it's those little things in that department that can make or break a guest's perception of a hotel. First night - no extra roll of toilet paper or extra box of tissues. A gasping moment for a person suffering from intense allergies. The toilet seat was unfastened on one side, making utilization of the throne not only an endeavour in paper conservation, but a physical balancing act as well. Chalked it up to, \"oh well, maybe they're running low, and will discover the missing seat fastener when they clean tomorrow and will promptly fix it.\" Yeah. No such luck. The seat never was fixed during our stay. No, I didn't call to complain about it because I believe things like this should be taken care of without guest intervention. Housekeeping should have alerted necessary staff to the problem and it should have been fixed without us having to call about it. Not that calling would have gotten us anywhere -- as eveidenced by the call we DID make to the desk about the toilet paper situation. \"We'll be right there,\" said the voice on the other end of the phone. No toilet paper ever came, necessitationg a trip to the public restroom -- outside -- on the other side of the pool deck -- where we swiped a roll of toilet paper to replace the empty roll in our room. You know what? A call about a lack of toilet paper would be considered an emergency if hotel staff suffered from a bladder infection. Third night -- the extra roll of toilet paper and extra box of tisses (over which we celebrated jubilantly) was quickly tempered by the lint explosion left behind on our bodies, clothes, hair and eveything else in the room after using the towels after a shower. Seriously. Like sand. Everywhere. Again, I wish to chalk up these little disappointments to an overwhemled staff or a fully packed house or a very busy week or whatever.

Had to wait 30 minutes to get a drink in the bar. Although they mention they are a Disney partner hotel the service is not to Disney standards and they don't have Character breakfasts as advertised, and the Disney shop closed, so not great for the children. If you like swimming just a point if you have children no lifeguards at all here, and parts of the pool are deep. Overall depends on what you want but this is by far the worse service I have had in any hotel in any country and would recommend you stay somewhere else where you can easily get same or better room and hotel quality but with good service as you don't want little bits of bad service when on holiday.

This hotel is also on a shuttle route with Downtown Disney which picks up every 30 minutes which was nice. Upon arrival, the front desk staff was very inviting and you are presented with a nicely decorated modern lobby, which leads into the bar/restaurant downstairs. The hotel has a very clean modern look to it, and the recent renovations definitely shine. We opted for a balcony with view of Downtown Disney, which was gorgeous at night but not a necessity (especially not for the extra 25 or so dollars). My only suggestion is to request a room above the 7th floor or so, as the noise from the restaurant tends to travel upwards in the morning. Overall, a very clean hotel with just the right amount of amenities in a perfect location.

There is a decision to be made on whether a disney property is what you want (extra park hrs, theme, etc)... but we found this to be a very comfortable, convenient alternative that allowed us to get a lot of park time in yet come home to a very civilized hotel.

We spent the first week of January 2011, 6 nights total at this hotel. I'll just go ahead and enumerate the pros and cons; Pros: The pool, it's big and very warm. We spent a few hours each day in the pool and really enjoyed it. The hotel has been completely renovated and it looks great inside and out, very contemporary in style. The rooms are very nice. The beds are comfortable, our room had an lcd tv with good quality tv (no picture noise). There's a safe which I used to fit a laptop, ipad, and the usual passports etc while we were away. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I forgot my toothbrush and they got me one right away, with complementary toothpaste. Daily housekeeping was very good too, the room was always kept clean. I also had a billing issue related to the parking pass (see further below) and the front desk resolved it at my satisfaction which I think is exceptional. The location is very convenient. It's a 10 minute walk to Downtown Disney. There are also free shuttles from the hotel to each Disney park running every 30 minutes all day long. The service is reliable, and did I say FREE. The shuttles are also a direct connection to any Disney Park so no need to transfer buses on the way there which is nice and better than some of the other Disney resorts. There are two shuttle buses and each bus covers two parks. Buses are operated by Mears. It takes the shuttle between 30 and 45 minutes to get to the park. The buses were not very crowded either when we were there so it's a comfortable ride. The on-site restaurant serves very good burgers and food was very good overall, as was the service. The bar service is also top notch. We got to enjoy a glass of red wine every night and the selection was good. Kids eat free at all times at the restaurant which is a nice touch too. Wifi internet was free and very fast too which was a nice touch. Cons: Well there's nothing really that would prevent me from recommending this hotel. We did find the bed pillows a bit on the thick side so we'll bring ours next time around. We were there on December 31st so of course people were partying out later than usual and on that night we found the room walls' noise insulation insufficient as we could hear our neighbors shouting and having fun. But the remaining 5 nights were perfectly quiet so no big deal. When checking in I was presented with some papers to sign and I mistakenly signed the parking pass form. This resulted in a 10$ per day fee being added to my bill even though I didn't have a car all week (we flew to FL and took a limo to the hotel). I had to dispute the charge at the end of my stay and the front desk resolved the situation to my satisfaction. I guess the con here would be that they should present the parking pass as being an extra and not an item included in the price of the room - which I thought was the case and is why I just signed it and whatnot. So just be aware that you'll need to specifically opt out of the parking if you don't want to incur these charges. The breakfast buffet is only on weekends, and is never free unlike some other Holiday Inn Express hotels. But kids always eat free and the food is very good.

Everything is NEW on the inside and beautifully & tastefully done. Lobby is smallish, but in marble with several areas to sit/wait for your car, etc. Parking costs per night, valet service extra. Once your car is parked, you never have to move it again. Front desk was VERY accommodating and curteous. Hotel has a bar and menu selections into the wee hours. A lovely restaurant fills an inner area with a ceiling that soars upward to the 13th floor area. Staff is very pleasant and the menu sports just about anything you might want. We opted for the \"breakfast package\" and could order ANYTHING from the menu, including the $12.95 steak and eggs. Saturday and Sunday morning was a buffet with made-to-order waffles and omlets. You are responsible for the breakfast vouchers presented upon arrival and must give these to your waitress. Three elevators available to take you to your floor. All new carpeting in the halls/paper and paint fresh. Rooms were beautiful with big bathrooms, marble floors & sink tops, fluffy towels, minty soaps, etc. Water HOT and plentiful. We had a balcony on the ninth floor (well worth the small extra cost) which overlooked Disney Village. At 9:30 pm we could watch the fireworks in Epcot. Balcony has two chairs and table. Ask for one with the open iron grill-work so you can watch the sunset, etc. and still sit in a chair. New bedding with soft mattresses, four pillows, feather comforters, CLEAN-new carpeting, thermostat heating/cooling, well lit, computer locking safe, refrigerator. (no microwave). Staff wonderful! Heated swimming pool open late and shaped like an hour-glass. Hot-tub offered outside. Water sprays add soothing sound. Shuttle service every 30 minutes takes you from the hotel to any Disney site you want to go. One con here, though, and that is the Hilton Hotel which is the first pick-up stop on the route. At 8:00 AM, seating on the bus is no problem, but at 8:30 or 9:00 Hilton people fill every seat and then some. Usually, standing room only when it gets to the Holiday Inn! But, on the flip side, the shuttles run like clock-work with destination schedules clearly marked on the outside of the A & B bus. Loading and unloading docks everywhere were marked on the pavement & included attendants to guide you. Bus drivers know everything...ask them when in doubt. One day we took a shuttle to Animal Kingdom, from there a shuttle to the Boardwalk, then a boat to Epcot, then a boat back to the Boardwalk, then a shuttle to Disney Village and from there the \"A\" bus back to the Holiday Inn. Scheduled every 5 and 35 minutes, we never waited any longer than 10 minutes for any one conveyance. I only mention this because you should not let the thought of traveling by shuttle in anyway influence your decision to stay at the hotel. We are country-folk and were rarely at a loss to get to and from the Holiday Inn during our five day stay. The cost of $179.00 per night (which included the breakfast package for four adults) and the brand-new-ness of the place was short of miraculous.

I think its not good to use the buses in the vacations because they probably will be very full and you'll have to be standing up. Im sure you won't find anything better in this price range (if you doesnt use the internet). My big complaint about this hotel is the internet. You can use it free in your room, if you bring a nettbook with you because the room only have a RJ45 connect. There's no wi-fi. I had to use the internet near the lobbly. It's a safe and closed room that you can open with your room card. If I remember, its 1 dollar for each 4 minutes, but the system doesnt work correct. When you remove and insert your card or log in or out you loose 0,25 cents. The real thing is you'll spend about 1 dollar for 2 minutes.

As with any Holiday Inn, it is not some type of luxurious hotel but the rooms are incredibly comfortable and SPOTLESS. As mentioned by previous reviewers, the hotel has recently gone through a major renovation and it really shows (the elevators seem like they were not updated for some reason though). The bath products were nice. The bed was comfortable. Our room, 301 (and it looked like all of them), had a balcony. Unfortunately the balcony face a parking lot and highway (which could be a bit noisy when standing outside). But as soon as you closed the door to the balcony the sound was completely gone. The sound-proofing on those doors/windows was great. Frankly, I would have loved a room on the other side with a view of downtown Disney, but I'm a realist. . .I paid about $90 a night for the room. . I can't have it all. The pool area is very nice. Also, clean and modern. I was determined to get some time in the pool but started becoming reluctant when it seemed a bit chilly outside. However, the pool was heated to a perfect temperature and the hot tub was a great touch for spending some time in the later afternoon breeze. The bartender in the lounge area (Jon I believe. . ??) was very friendly, talkative, asked about our stay, etc. Plus he made good drinks that were perfect to relax with for a bit after a long day at the parks. Little things like that make the stay much more enjoyable. The breakfast buffet was a bit over-priced, but no more so than any other dining option in the disney area. The only thing I was not too fond about was after leaving the room one morning (9:00 AM) to go to the Animal Kingdom and returning at 5:00 PM for what was supposed to be a rest, I was surprised to find that the room had not been serviced. After we walked in, someone knocked on the door to take care of it. So we had to go sit in the lobby for a bit. However, I just considered this an isolated insident (maybe a lack of staff that day or something). This didn't happen any other day. The shuttle buses to the parks were very efficient and the walk to downtown disney is less than 10 minutes. There really is no need to rent a car whiel staying here if you intend to spend all of your time in Disney World. (Helpful tip: a taxi from the airport will cost about $60. There is a public bus (lynx 111) with an stop directly across from downtown disney that will get you to the airport in less than an hour for $2.00. It certainly is not as efficient but it does spent several parts of the journey on the highway and only makes a few stops along the way). You are going to be spending a LOT of money while in Disney. So why not save where you can.) Overall, this has to be the best hotel value in downtown disney.

Was were able to get our 2 bed room for $99 a night. The price was right but the room was not very clean. You could see dust on all the surfaces throughout the room. But the worst, was the bathroom. The shower curtain smelled of humidity. So much so that we had to close the bathroom door at night to be able to sleep without the nasty odor. We would have called and complained, but by the time we got into our room (pass 11:00 PM), I doubt that they would have changed the shower curtain for us. The only other disappointing thing about the hotel was the $10 per night/per car parking fee that we were charged.

On the 5th floor, it opened out to the pool area with a small but nice enough balcony (two chairs and a very small round table). Smoking was NOT allowed in the rooms (or anywhere, it seemed) except out on said balcony. We did smoke a cigar out there but were told to keep the door to the room firmly shut or else risk a cleaning fee. No problem, we completely understood. No, my only issue with the hotel was, when I'd looked into booking about a week before we arrived, the rate was $79 + taxes but it had to be prepaid. Since I wasn't 100% sure we'd be able to go to Orlando (in FL visiting family), I didn't want to risk that. When I booked it the night before, the exact same room for the same dates had shot up to $117 taxes. So, less than a week later, a $38 dollar increase/48% increase.

The reason we chose this hotel was that we wanted to make our trip first trip to Disney World and Universal as economical as possible. Staying at Disney World itself (where the theme parks are located) made the trip too expensive so after much searching on the Internet we chose this hotel (which is a Disney hotel) near the Downtown Disney area and we were not disappointed. The hotel is about a 10 minute leisurely walk to Downtown Disney (which are full of shops and places to eat) and approximately a 15 minute (sometimes a little more) bus ride to the various Disney theme parks. We weren't sure how we would find the free bus rides to the theme parks but these were just fine. The buses always arrived on time and came regularly throughout the day and evening. Due to the age of our children, 9 and 10, we would catch the 9.00am bus to the theme parks and return anywhere between 5.00pm and 8.00pm in the evening. The hotel rooms were well appointed (they even had a bar fridge) and were extremely clean. The housekeeping was done daily and to a very high standard. There was a soda vending machine and ice machine in the hallway to our hotel room which was very convenient. Our children loved the pool area (and so did we). What also really impressed us about the hotel was that children who are 12 and younger are able to eat at the hotel for free. This made a huge difference to our holiday budget. Breakfast was always well catered for and very fresh. Every morning we started our day with the buffet breakfast which was just lovely (the omelettes were delicious). We also chose to dine in the restaurant each evening rather than queuing at the various Downtown Disney restaurants and paying the high prices there. Although the choice of meals in the evening were slightly limited the food was cooked to a very high standard. The restaurant staff were always extremely friendly and accommodating and nothing was ever too much trouble. We regularly asked if a fresh salad or a bowl of fruit could be prepared to go with our children's meals and this was always made possible. Our children were always made to feel very welcome at the restaurant. During our stay at the hotel we also spent a day at Universal's Island of Adventure and this was about a 20 minute taxi ride, from the hotel, which the hotel staff organized for us. The taxi driver charged us a round trip fare of $50 for this and we arranged a time and place to meet him after our day at Universal and this worked out very well (The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is a must see for any fans of the movies). Also for those of who are interested when we arrived at Orlando International Airport we went to the taxi area where a fee of $52 was confirmed for the drive to the hotel from the person organizing cabs. At the end of our stay we needed a hire car and very conveniently across the road and a 4 minute walk from the Holiday Inn, there was a hire car counter for Dollar Rent a Car at the Regal Sun Resort Hotel so we were able to conveniently collect a hire car for our drive out to NASA. We would definitely consider staying at Holiday Inn when visiting Disney World at a future date due to the value, cleanliness, location and welcoming staff.", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Disney Location\u201d", "Author": "mbmb81", "ReviewID": "UR84158707", "Content": "Got a great discounted rate on this hotel.

First day, I didn't get charged for tea with the buffet, 2nd day I got charged which I thought was unusual (even asked the waiter about it), saw the manager that night and he gave me credit on my bill for the tea, and the 3rd day I was charged again - spoke with a different manager & it was taken off. Everyone seems to blame it on the new help so hopefully the servers will get trained on what is included. I've never had an all you can get buffet breakfast where tea was charged extra & coffee wasn't - normally the waiters are always asking if you want more. Plus, for the price there should be no question that it should be included. So they need to be consistent in what they do. If you eat breakfast there --- make sure you ask for waitress \"Que\" --- she is a wonderful server. Everyone I spoke with wanted to correct the situation --- they are trying hard.

I read other reviews on Trip Advisor prior to staying so I was expecting good things. The hotel and its staff did not let us down. We had an excellent experience. Check in was a breeze. The room was immaculate and comfortable. It had a nice size fridge which is not mentioned on their website, but was a nice amenity. The hotel has only been open for 6 months and everything is brand new. The beds were very comfortable. The room was very quiet, as we could hear no other hotel guests when in the room. Granted, the hotel was relatively empty because of the time of year, but it still seems as if it would be quiet during more crowded times. Being a Holiday Inn, children eat free with a paying adult. This meant for all meals - breakfast, lunch and dinner. I actually felt bad sitting down to a meal and not having to pay for anything but my meal. The service in the restaurant was great. The food was also excellent. My children loved all of the menu selections. There were nice options of substituting veggies or fruit salad as a side instead of always having fries. The adult fare was just as good. It was nice to be in a place like Orlando, where you expect to be eating a lot of burgers and greasy park food, to sit down and have healthy and delicious food. The restaurant is in the main lobby which is open to the interior of the hotel. You look up 14 floors to the glass pyramid at the top. You can also see the two glass enclosed elevators making their way up and down. The hotel has great facilities. There was a grab-n-go snack area which had basic quick selections like yogurt, muffins and pre-made sandwiches, in addition to a coffee station and other drinks. There was what looked like a very nice bar that was open any time we passed by it, but I didn't get to utilize it being with three children. There was also a Disney gift shop. However, it was undergoing renovations while we were there and was closed the entire time. I would have liked to see its contents, but then felt like it was a blessing in disguise because I didn't have my children walking by it each day asking to look around. The pool facility was excellent and very relaxing. I saw another post saying it was too small. I cannot see anyone calling this pool too small. It is a great size. Landscaping is beautiful and there is ample seating around the pool. Music was playing at all times which I enjoyed. It was never too loud and I loved whatever selections were played. There is also a hot tub next to the pool - very relaxing. The one negative thing I have to comment on is the mandatory $10 per day parking fee. I knew about the fee prior to checking in, but it still seemed like a rip off. The parking lot was empty, but they had the bulk of the spots near the main entrance coned off for valet parking which comes at a $16 per day price tag. I just factored the daily parking fee into the price of the room for the night, and I felt the hotel was still a very good value for the price I paid. All in all, we all loved this hotel. My children said it was the best hotel they have stayed at. I have already told several people about our stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good value in Orlando. I know it doesn't come with the perk of Extra Magic Hours, but it did have free shuttles to all Disney parks. We did not use them as we tried out Universal Studios on this trip. Even though the rides at Universal are excellent, we definitely missed the \"Disney magic\".

From the time we checked in (9 pm) until the time we checked out 2 days later (late check out of 2:00 p.m.) our stay was perfect. Rooms were fantastic, staff was courteous and the view of downtown Disney from our outside balcony was fantastic! We are platinum priority club members and this is the only downfall of our stay. Even though we were given a complimentary upgrade from poolview room to a Downtown Disney view room NOTHING else was offered to us even with our status. We still had to pay for parking, we received no \"treats\" when we checked in and received NO complimentary breakfast for any of us on any day we stayed which we have NEVER experienced in any of our Holiday Inn stays. When we returned home from our vacation we received a call from the hotel asking us how our stay was and I did explain to the manager my concerns over not receiving any perks as a priority club members with platinum status. He assured me that they are in fact working on those issues and hope to institute them sometime in the near future! I was happy to hear that! We ate in the restaurant both mornings (buffet) and found the food to be fresh and well prepared. Also, we enjoyed the outdoor pool before checking out (did receive a late checkout because of priority club!) and found the pool to be quite lovely and in great working condition.

The hotel is definitely a good value and probably, in my opinion, the best place to stay in the Downtown Disney area of seven hotels. I've had some trouble (particularly with mold) with the other hotels. Because this hotel was gutted to its core and rebuilt (can't really say the hotel was renovated as that would not do the hotel justice), it is clean, comfortable, and a good value. I attached a picture from the panel on the back of the door to show the room layouts. Note this is for the tower (the wing is a bit different). Basically, rooms 01-04 are at the back of the hotel and have balconies and face I-4. Rooms 05-09 have balconies and face the Downtown Disney area and the Hilton next door. Rooms 10-13 also have balconies and face Hotel Plaza Blvd and the Epcot area (can probably see Disney fireworks from these rooms). Rooms 14-18 do NOT have balconies (except on the 14th floor) and face the Royal Plaza next door and I-4. As you can see, it looks like room 18 has a smaller living area as the service elevator is in that area also. The windows and sliding glass doors are of a strong glass so you don't hear the traffic from the road. The common areas of the hotel are well-maintained, modern, and clean. The restaurant is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Lunch and dinner feature an asian-inspired menu. The bar serves the restaurant menu as well as its own small bar menu with bar-type foods. The bar also has a small outside area beside the pool that is good for eating, drinking, or hanging out. The food is very good, and a decent value compared to what one would pay at the parks. The Disney gift shop remains under construction. The Grab 'N Go selection is limited, and better options can be found at the neighboring hotels. The Royal Plaza next door has a better Grab 'N Go area with fruit, sandwiches, salads, etc., and the Hilton next door also has a decent selection of prepared sandwiches for quick meals. Also, the Doubletree hotel two hotels down offers a limited Pizza Hut menu. The Holiday Inn also offers a small fitness room and business center on-site. As for the rooms, they are roomy and the housekeepers do a good job keeping them clean. The LCD TV offers a generous selection of channels (35 or so), although I don't think they were in HD. There is no LodgeNet-esque service so there is no pay-per-view or video game option. The rooms offer free wired high-speed Internet, a nice work desk, plenty of lighting, an in-room safe, and an in-room refrigerator. Some rooms have a stand-up shower stall whereas others offer a traditional tub/shower combination. The beds are comfortable and the triple-sheeting is a nice touch. The maintenance staff members were extremely outgoing and friendly. The housekeeping staff was a little too persistent about getting into the room to clean. The front desk staff were generally helpful and friendly. Overall, since this hotel was rebuilt it is going to offer the best rooms and amenities. You can most likely find cheaper options at some of the other hotels in the area on the popular hotel price finding web sites, but it's worth paying a couple more dollars to stay here for the quality and service. My only suggestion for improvement would be to enhance the Grab 'N Go area to be comparable to what other hotels in the area offer -- you don't want your guests to have to go next door to get a snack.", "Date": "August 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, VA", "Title": "\u201cCan't beat this place for the price\u201d", "Author": "Andrew B", "ReviewID": "UR74063973", "Content": "I was a little upset when I first checked in, since my room wasn't ready until exactly 4.

They have an omlet/waffle bar or a cold cereal, yogurt and pastry bar for $9.95 which includes the coffee (omlets and waffles were great but pastries were dry). I found this to be a great value and time saver. BUT we found each morning that the waitress tried to give us the $14.95 breakfast which was both sides with juice. REALLY - who could eat all that! So when they ask if you want juice when you sit down say no until they explain the buffett prices to you. The last morning my daughter noticed that the waitress charge my husband for the $14.95 buffett and she did change it to the $9.95. You can also order off the menu which some did and the food looked great. Downtown Disney is only about two blocks from the hotel. Very convenient to walk to at night. The bus to Magic Kingdom, Epcot, etc. is right outside the front door and runs every half hour. It was great not to have to drive and pay for the parking (of course we paid parking at the hotel).

Third, I understand this place is designed to inconvenience customers, so we can spent more money on amenities, but amenities should be convenient and accessible, such as a washer and dryer. I did not expect to spend so much on washing clothes, and to have to deal with only \"3 washers and dryers\" for the whole entire building. Not good for a customer that has an extended stay. Fourth and Fifth, no where in the website does it say about parking fees, not sure why you would charge a customer parking fees, when your already having to spent money on everything else. And lastly, it would have been nice if there was a microwave in the room, since we had to rearrange our eating expenses. Unfortunately, this Holiday Inn did not meet my expectations, and believe me we have stayed in many holiday inns.

The minor annoyances, perhaps more puzzling than annoying, included a \"king-size\" bed, which was actually a mid-king, part way between king and queen size, and more significantly, a very small bathroom. The bathroom measured only 5x8 feet, yet crowded a full size tub, toilet, and vanity, along with a full complement of toiletries and many towels into this tiny space. There was no available wall space for even a towel rack, and the one wall hook was located awkwardly above a piece of framed art.

Folks may not know that this is probably the largest attended group event in Orlando every year. This Holiday Inn was full with mostly gay men, who can be the most discerning (fussiest?) travelers on the planet. Well, we only heard very good things all around. The pool area is nice, the food in the restaurant was good, and the staff very nice. The new renovation is very good. Rooms are more basic and big than posh, but who hangs in their rooms with the theme parks outside anyway? The only hitch may have been slow elevators, but remember the hotel was packed and the pool was busy with parties from morning til late night - boys were traveling the elevators constantly. So there was a lot of activity that the new staff handled very well. We paid $8 a day for parking, no big deal, but that may have only been for our event - check with the hotel ahead. It's only a few minutes walk to Lake Buena Vista so location is perfect for Disney. Highly recommended and we hope the Holiday Inn is a host location for this event next year.

Great view of the pool and Downtown Disney and not much noise from the nearby road. Staff were all friendly and efficient and this hotel really felt like a home from home for us. ALL staff were always friendly and courteous and made us feel very welcome. Lovely pool with great restaurant and bar - Matt is the best bar tender an Orlando ! Easy walk to Downtown Disney and also Crossroads in the other direction - didnt really need the car at all. We had a problem with noise one night from the next door room which kept us awake but when we cpmplained to the manager he was very apologetic and gave us $60 vouchers for the restaurant and credit our Priority Club with 25,000 points - how good is that ? Thank you Edward Lopez !! Overall this was a fantastic stay - do not mistake this hotel for any of the other Holiday Inns in this area as this one is by far the best.
