We chose well. What a beautiful hotel this is. The layout and accommodation is absolutely stunning and right slap bang in the middle of working rice fields gives the place a feel of being part of Bali rather than just visiting which is what we were looking for: Extreme luxury, but deeply embedded in the land. The shuttle takes just over 5 mins to get to the centre of Ubud and a bit longer to get back as Ubud is a one way circle in the centre and runs on the hour. During those 5 mins on the shuttle you pass the entrance to the Monkey Forest in case you want to stop off and take a wander there which is well worthwhile. We never walked into Ubud from the hotel, but I reckon it would take 20-25 mins for an average speed walker to get to the central drop off point (the sister hotel) if you follow the route of the shuttle. If on the other hand when you exit the hotel you turn right and right again you can walk into the Monkey Forest from the back gate in about 10 minutes and a further 5 mins to the centre. There is also much less traffic on this back route. We had already booked this hotel before the review of the 24th August about the lax security. Sadly it concerned us and I wonder if we would have booked the hotel having read that report. We were so glad we had already booked the hotel as it turned out and feel saddened how one persons review can so easily damage an up and coming beautiful hotel such as this one. The reviewers complaint about the view from his villa isn\u9225\u6a9b reasonable in my opinion. Yes that part of the rice field is small, but its stepped and fully visible from the terrace with a view that I sincerely believe most people would have loved. In fact if I were ranking the view from that villa I would say it had the second best view of rice field in the hotel. Other than the entrance with tight security we didn\u9225\u6a9b see much evidence of patrolling, but its clear there were plenty of staff around the hotel and in my opinion you should see for yourself what a wonderful place the hotel is. Moving on. We had the top of the range pool villa which was truly magnificent. Every amenity in a deluxe environment and beautifully clean and classy. Lots of storage space\u9225?My wife was able to hang up all her clothes which is highly unusual!The villa also had two little ponds separated by the outside tub. Both ponds full of small fish which was a major bonus. Feeding them with bits of bread from breakfast\u9225?.They spend half their time biting your fingers, but it feels like tickling. The inside shower had a floor to ceiling window looking out on the outside shower and one of the little ponds. Likewise the separate toilet had a glass wall looking on the other pond. Really quite gorgeous and restful. The restaurant has a sophisticated look downstairs and a more casual feel upstairs on the balcony \u9225?which has absolutely fantastic views of rice fields. A clever part of the design of the resort is having a couple of rice fields in the central area of the hotel for everyone to admire. A stroll round the entire grounds takes about half an hour if you investigate every nook and cranny\u9225\ue6ddhich we did. Beautiful walkways with lovely planting and clever architecture. There was a library, table tennis, pool and a large (and cold!) swimming pool, plus an area for afternoon tea. We used the spa a couple of times and thoroughly enjoyed that too. Breakfast was nothing special, but the outlook over the rice fields was amazing. We lingered long over breakfast just enjoying the serenity and magnificent views inside and outside the hotel. Lunch and dinner could be served in the more sophisticated section downstairs and was accompanied by live local music which we also enjoyed. The staff throughout the hotel were really nice and helpful. Maybe not as clone trained as many top resorts, but because they were such beautiful people their natural niceness shone through. This is one of the best hotels you could ever wish to relax in. Go try it out.", "Date": "Oct 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR370352948", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "melwood"}, {"Content": "Best hotel we stayed at in Bali! At first, I was a bit hesitant booking a hotel that was 15 minutes away from the main area of Ubud. But my husband and I were on our honeymoon and wanted to splurge on a private villa, with a pool and outdoor tub and shower. And for under $200/night, it was definitely a steal!When we arrived at our villa, we were very very impressed. The room was surrounded by windows, with a pond that wrapped around the villa. Our bedroom overlooked the pool area that had a small cabana area and just behind the bedroom was the outdoor tub. The tub was definitely bliss and relaxing. Unfortunately, I had broke the ceramic bottle of bath foam and had to pay $10. =( Outside of the villa was very nicely landscaped with huge lotus flowers ponds and fountains. Breakfast brunch had an amazing view of the rice paddies. Really beautiful morning to wake up to! Some of the other great qualities about this hotel: Staff is extremely friendly and very accommodating. They have convenient shuttle vans that go to and from Ubud Resort to Hotel on Monkey Forest Road every hour between 9am to 9pm (except 1pm). They can drop you off at your destination if it's around the main Ubud area and pick you up at the Ubud Hotel. They can also arrange drivers to take you around the area. For 350,000 rupiahs (roughly $40 USD), we had a private 3.5 hour tour guide. We also paid this amount to take us back to DPS airport. Because Ubud Resort is slightly farther away, you may have to pay about 40,000 to 50,000 rupiahs to get back to the resort if not using the shuttle. However, anything can be bargained in Ubud and was able to go as low as 30,000 rup. Other than that, I don't think there is anything negative I can say about this hotel. I would 100% recommend this hotel.", "Date": "Sep 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR261005294", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Michelle530"}, {"Content": "Good value rooms but poor security \u9225?while we were asleep our room was burgled Obviously having our room burgled while we slept negatively affected our experience . To give a balanced review let me share our thoughts both before and after our unlucky time. It\u9225\u6a9a a long review \u9225?if you don\u9225\u6a9b have time to get the whole picture jump to the last couple of paragraphs.Before the robbery: Our first impressions of the resort were that it is secluded and peaceful and the rooms, without question, are beautiful and great value for money. We were on our honeymoon and were looking for two things: a touch of luxury and the \u9225\u6df0iew Directly To Swaying Rice Field Of Ubud And Landscaped Garden\u9225?as promised in the description on Expedia. When we arrived we were told we had been upgraded which obviously sounds great and when we saw the room we had mixed feelings \u9225?it was truly magnificent accommodation with outdoor shower, bath, private pool, loungers etc. \u9225?but there was no view as it was surrounded on all sides by wall or hedge. Obviously a bit of a dilemma \u9225?on the one hand you feel lucky and on the other you\u9225\u6a99e left wondering what the view might have been like. So we asked to see some other rooms \u9225?just to see if we\u9225\u6a87 prefer the view from them. That was no problem and we saw another villa that was indeed next to a small rice paddy but it was not what we had in mind as it was not a \u9225\u6e27iew\u9225?in the \u9225\u6e27ista\u9225?sense of the word i.e. a view that you\u9225\u6a87 like to look at for a little while with a drink; and it really was a very small rice paddy and at the time was unplanted \u9225?so it was more of a muddy pond. So we stuck with our upgraded bit of bling and felt like life could indeed have been much worse. We asked the management if it would be OK if we decided to check out early if we changed our minds and they said it would be no problem. The next morning we had breakfast and it became clear that the resort does have a lovely view that you\u9225\u6a87 like to enjoy over a drink \u9225?but that the only place to really savour this view is from the restaurant. We really enjoyed our peaceful breakfast and decided that we\u9225\u6a87 probably stick with the place \u9225?why not?After the robbery: When we woke up on the morning of our second night we realised that during the night that someone had come into our room and stolen some of our things. It was one of those horrible moments when you realise that things just are not quite right\u9225? Our day packs had been taken from the room and some of our possessions had been left in the outdoor shower area and on top of the external wall between the outdoor shower and the pathway beside the villa. The items discarded by the burglar in the shower area included my wife\u9225\u6a9a glasses (left on the bedside table following watching a movie before falling asleep). It was clear that the burglar had quietly gone through our room \u9225?careful not to wake us up - and picked up items a bit at random in the dark. They then sorted through the things whilst sitting on the top of the wall and left what was not of interest. In this case they took our cameras, camera equipment and a few other items in our daypacks. Luckily our passports and credit cards were in the safe. We normally put cameras in the safe too but it doesn\u9225\u6a9b necessarily occur to you that someone would come in the room while you\u9225\u6a99e in it. So you can imagine we\u9225\u6a99e feeling a little bit \u9225\u6e1fhaken\u9225?\u9225?someone has been in the room while you slept and taken things from your bedside table. Not a great feeling. On reflection, I guess burglary can happen at any hotel but the thing that really helps you understand the philosophy of a place is their reaction when there is a problem. I went to reception and explained what had happened and asked them to call the Police and the manager of the hotel. I asked numerous times but they absolutely would not call the Police until a manager had arrived. The deputy manager arrived after about 30 mins and then called the police and the General Manager. A contingent of Police arrive and take a look at the villa. They see our possessions in the shower area and on top of the wall (wet from rain during the night) and they see marks on the outside of the wall where someone had climbed over into our villa. A layer of dust had settled on the wall so it was very easy to see the marks showing where the burglar had climbed up. Then the General Manager finally arrives. I meet him in reception and ask him if he wants to see the room. He says \u9225\u6e18o need\u9225?as the Police have already seen it and have everything they need for their report. We\u9225\u6a87 expected the junior staff to be a little bit indifferent \u9225?I mean what can they do about anything \u9225?but I had expected the General Manager to take the issue seriously and be concerned not only for our welfare but about the state of security at the hotel. Not only was he completely indifferent but he was also pretty sceptical that we\u9225\u6a87 been burgled. He kept on saying \u9225\u6e0bf you have been burgled\u9225?and \u9225\u6e28e have to wait for the result of the Police investigation\u9225?to find out what happened. We really were astounded. We were on our honeymoon in a $470 night place and the General Manager basically thinks we\u9225\u6a99e making it all up. And he can\u9225\u6a9b even be bothered to come see the room. The approach was much more like \u9225\u6e0bndifferent landlord\u9225?vs \u9225\u6e09otel manager\u9225? His point was he was not going to do a thing until the Police had \u9225\u6e07inished their inquiries\u9225? Which of course would take days/weeks/whatever. I said we\u9225\u6a87 talk to him later. We went to the Police station (for 3 hours) and filed the report. They were clearly satisfied it was a burglary and gave us the report we would need for the insurance. When we came back I had another conversation with the General Manager. We wanted to know what he was going to do about the situation. $3000 worth of camera equipment had been stolen and the only thing he kept on mentioning was that he was \u9225\u6e0bn a difficult situation about the security certificate\u9225? I asked him what he proposes. Answer: nothing. I ask him if he expects us to pay for the night\u9225\u6a9a stay during which we were burgled \u9225?he says \u9225\u6e19f course\u9225? Well maybe he\u9225\u6a9a technically in the right but the way he says all these things is with complete indifference. Fundamentally the hotel has an issue - it does not run itself like it's a hotel but more a collection of villas. When we stayed at the Oberoi (amazing by the way) the place is surrounded by security guards stopping non-guests from entering the grounds. The Ubud Village Resort, in contrast, felt deserted. The resort accepted zero responsibility for what happened and were not gracious in the slightest. Not the behaviour you expect from a top end place. My advice to you if you choose to stay: Lock every one of your doors and hope for the best as this not a place equipped to deal with problems. Check out the other less positive reviews on TripAdvisor, especially one from August of 2007. I wish i had before we came! On a positive note... there are some beautiful things to see in Ubud... we had a lovely trek in the Sayung valley (and the 4 Seasons in that valley really did look special). But if you have the time while you are in Indonesia check out the Tana Toraja region of Sulawesi.... that is a truly beautiful and culturally interesting experience.
