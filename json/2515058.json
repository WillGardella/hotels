I only waited about ten minutes for the van. Check-in went quickly and smoothly. I stayed in a third floor room. It was small but had every comfort I needed. Fridge, microwave, coffee maker, wireless, etc. I didn't have time to use any of the facilities. I did enjoy \"Happy hour\" at Jimmy's, the bar/restaurant that co-joins the hotel. They have a regular happy hour and an evening one. The happy hour menu is rather varied with decent prices. If you sit at the bar and look out onto Broadway, the view is disorienting in a fun way.

Bathroom is a bit on the small side, but nothing to complain about. Free breakfast included, area very crowded, but we were there for college football game at CenturyLink, so very busy weekend. Breakfast choices were adequate. Pool is open 24 hours which was great for the kids and the pool area is well taken care of.

Although the hotel was completely full, we got the room we had asked for: quiet, away from elevators/drink machines, and close to fire exit. We received a top floor (7th floor) room which was nice, bit of a view. The room was spacious and clean. We had a semi-corner room with a fireplace; not sure if they all have one. Fridge and microwave too. Aveda shampoo/conditioner. Bed was fine. Aside from a bit of pipe noise, the room was as quiet as we had hoped. There was a large flat-screen wall-mounted TV.

However, we did not have to wait for either food or a table, just look around -- somewhat impressive considering the hotel was full. It helped that the weather was decent and people could sit outside. The hotel has lots of nice extras, starting with the free parking which we didn't really expect. We used the free shuttle to downtown, and tipped generously as the driver took us right to Benaroya Hall (I particularly appreciated not having to start the evening with a 5-block walk in high heels). Free coffee/tea in the lobby all day, including a decent-tasting decaf. The little store in the lobby has fairly reasonable prices. Free wifi throughout was easy to access. Finally, they have pre-printed instructions at the front desk about how to get to I-5 from the hotel and how to return, very clear and easy to follow.

Location was good for the Space Needle and the Experience Music Project as well as most everything else. Situated just over the street from Lake Union the hotel was nicely situated, nice to just stroll around the local area with yachts, restaurants and the lake and shore. We were glad of this as although it might have been handier to have been staying more centrally we did appreciated the quieter, prettier, area the Silver Cloud is located in. The free hotel shuttle to various downtown locations (most of the major tourist hotspots) was a boon and we give a special shout out to Paul the driver who went out of was for us. Also big thanks to the other shuttle driver, I'm sorry Sir we forgot your name too, who drove us door to door for a meeting when it was tipping with rain.

The mini fridge and microwave were very useful for storing snacks for the kids. The room was quiet and restful even for afternoon naps for the young one. The complimentary breakfast was wonderful.

Is there also a written or unwrotten rule in the hotel industry that states all hotel beds must be stiff as a [---] board? This hotel is no exception. Hide-a-bed. Typical bar-in-your-back variety. Refrigerator. The fridge in the room was barely cold at all. Environment. It is mid March.. The temperature outside dips in to the 40's at night. So will someone please tell me why the hell I have to run the NOISY air conditioning at full tilt to keep the temperature DOWN in the room?? And while we're at it, can someone please explain the mysterious invisible barrier that prevents the cool air from passing from the living area into the bed area? Living area is colder than the refrigerator, while the bed area is roasting. WTH??? Needless to say we literally got no sleep tonight (I'm posting in real time from the room on 3/22/10). We were supposed to stay here for two nights but there's no way I'm going through this uncomfortable nightmare again.

The shuttle is free and we had no problem getting on a shuttle at the last minute...never had to pre-reserve. Be sure to ask the driver for a map of sites. Parking is free which awesome since hourly parking even near the hotel runs about $2/hr. We never had a problem finding parking even at 10pm.

My family came to Seattle to meet friends from Oregon to spend the weekend to watch 2 nights of baseball at Safeco Field. Our friends arrived before us, they called the front desk to find out if we had checked-in, as they booked reservations on the shuttle to take us to the baseball game, and would cancel the shuttle as a courtesy for other guests to use if we had not arrived, they were told by front desk we had not checked-in, so based on that, they released the shuttle reservations. Meanwhile we were already checked-in as we saw our friends in the lobby within minutes of their conversation with the front desk, interestingly it was the same staff member who checked us in that advised them we had not. When we went to inquire with the reservation desk to see if there was any chance to still get on the shuttle, we were told reservations were already given to someone else and the shuttle was full. However, when we asked the shuttle driver, we found out the shuttle was not full and there was indeed enough seats for our party. The shuttle does not take you to the downtown area of Seattle where the department stores and shopping is located, so we took the street car about a block and 1/2 away. We discovered the street car ourselves, as the staff at the hotel didn't advise us of this, we were told to walk 3 blocks for a city bus. I really felt any time we asked the front desk a question, we were putting them out, of course we asked the same staff member every time we had a question. We were really kind and gentle in our delivery when speaking with this particular front desk employee and in no way came across demanding, and yet her mannerisms and facial expressions let us know we were a bother. Room size decent, but not large like some reviews mentioned. You better get into the free continental breakfast at least 15 minutes before closing, as they are packing up right in front and around you, even seeing there is still a stream of people waiting in line for toast and the waffle maker, however if you miss it, no great lost, as it's marginal at best.

Traveling to Seattle from Hawaii and arriving at the hotel at midnight was an adventure-we drove from the SeaTac airport with all of the construction barriers along the I-5 made our drive to the hotel a very \"hairy experience\". Luck was on our side and once we spotted the Seattle downtown highrise lights, we knew we were on the right direction. Our check in was a breeze so after our long flight and finally finding our hotel, we had a very comfortable sleep on soft beds. The secure hotel parking was free so it's a big plus in a town that usually charge for parking and the hotel provides a pretty good continential breakfast which we enjoyed every morning. Our room was clean and comfortable and it had all of the comforts of home- a microwave oven, a mini-refrig, a bar sink, free internent access, a 40\" flat screen tv and a free washer/dryer unit on every floor. There is an exercise workout room & a heated swimming pool for the workout folks and the hotel provides a free shuttle bus ride to downtown. There is a computer room which provides free internet and there are even printers to run your print outs. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. The only drawbacks are that there is no hotel restaurant on site so the guests will have to patronize the neighboring restaurants which were a bit pricy for us-most of our lunches & dinners were elsewhere. The other drawback, if you're the type who is use to in taking the hotel elevator on the lobby floor is that this hotel is designed for the guests to go out throught a door next to the front desk, pass the hotel parking driveway and enter through a secure door to the hotel elevators which I thought was pretty weird. Check out was fast & simple and if you like to stay in a small local hotel which is located in a very quiet neighborhood (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center is next door) and has many good hotel amenities right the the mid-point of downtown Seattle and the University of Washington campus, the Silver Cloud Inn @ Lake Union is highly recommended from this Hawaiian couple.", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Longmont, CO", "Title": "\u201cOrdinary hotel, weird mattresses\u201d", "Author": "TravelingMom02", "ReviewID": "UR32749033", "Content": "Our family of 4 stayed here for 2 nights, and we actually booked the stay based on the positive reviews from TripAdvisor.

This hotel was recommended to me by my sister who lives in Seattle and it was absolutely perfect for our needs. One of the main benefits was the free parking - I hadn't been to Seattle in a long time but found the parking in the centre to be quite expensive and a bit of a hassle; the hotel shuttle service was absolutely fantastic. They dropped us off exactly where we wanted to go and with a phone call back to the hotel they would pick us up pretty much wherever we were. The shuttle drivers were also great as ad hoc tour guides! The room was excellent -- large, comfortable and absolutely pristine in terms of cleanliness. They did not tend to replace the toiletries unless I asked (we stayed for nearly a week so we had used them up well before the end of our stay) but when asked they would supply whatever you asked, no hassle. The view of Lake Union was great - at first when you get there it seems a bit odd, the place looks like a soulless anodyne apartment block and you are just looking onto some yacht repair yard over the road but in fact the view at night is fantastic, and during the day seeing the seaplanes take off and land is quite something. I would recommend booking a 'view' room to that end. There are a few nice restaurants over the road, a sushi place which I did not try, and a bit further down a couple of really nice seafood places. I think we went to Chandlers Quay or something like that? It was very nice. Also, rather bizarrely, a Hooters, which I did not try, thought I had an interesting time explaining the whole concept of said establishment to my son. The breakfast was just OK, I did notice that the fresh fruit seemed to go early on (I was jet-lagged the whole time so saw the very early shift as well as later on) without being replenished, and you were left with the usual carb-heavy choices of make-your-own waffles, english muffins, toast, etc as well as cereals. The juice was good. Coffee and tea available all the time and the use of the pool and fitness suite was very good. There is a business centre so you can use the internet freely and this includes use of a printer which was handy for printing directions, airline boarding cards, etc. I think this may be fairly standard in American hotels but coming from Europe this seemed very civilized indeed! All in all, this is a great place to stay which is away from the centre of Seattle but still near enough to be handy for all the sights you would want to see, particularly with the use of the free shuttle service. Anyone with kids should go to the REI store a few minutes drive away for the fantastic climbing wall, they do taster climbs for very little money and the staff are so friendly and enthusiastic.

For $1.75 (or $.50 for seniors, children or the disabled), you can ride the streetcar into downtown Seattle and a single ticket is valid for 2 hours. The inn makes up for its non-central location by offering guests free breakfast (a delightful assortment of goodies), a free evening reception (including wine, beer or non-alcoholic beverages), complimentary laundry facilities, a pool, and FREE parking in the hotel garage! To top it off, the facility is clean and the staff is helpful and attentive -- and great rates are to be had. So, if you're up for a little Seattle exploration by foot, then the Silver Cloud Inn is a definite find! By comparison, I've stayed at several Seattle area hotels and each has their appeal. Unlike some of my other favorite places to stay (listed below), the Silver Cloud Inn - Lake Union has them beat in overall value. If you want a place that's nice, but not hoity-toity, where you can stretch your dollar without losing amenties, the Silver Cloud Inn - Lake Union can't be beat. [Other area hotels I might recommend: Hotel Max = Rock n' roll style modern hotel within walking distance of The Paramount, Pacific Place and other downtown shopping/sights. Relatively inexpensive, but being in an old building has definite drawbacks -- pay to park, noisy on lower floors, and tight quarters, especially. Inn at the Market = Elegant botique hotel situated at Pike Place Market, within walking distance of the Seattle Art Museum, the Showbox and downtown shopping.

We had a hide-a-bed couch and coffee table, huge flat screen tv with a good selection of channels, two sink areas and very nice amenities (Aveda bath products, Tully's coffee, and a GOOD blow dryer!) Towels were large and fluffy and plentiful. We were given a copy of the Seattle Times in the morning, which was a nice alternative to the usual USA Today! Everything was spotless and the beds were very comfortable. My only complaint would be the heating/air system. It didn't seem to have a thermostat, (I could be wrong about this, as it was late when we went to bed, and I didn't spend a whole lot of time examining it--just turned it to a cooler temp) so it was just on or off and it was hard to get a comfortable sleeping temperature going. The fan wasn't overly loud, but it was a constant hum. It was nice to have free underground parking (particularly when I saw plenty of ice-covered cars on the road in the morning!) and free internet service.

We made a lot of use of the shuttle service to and from downtown. The stops are convenient, the service very friendly and they even had a carseat for our little one to sit in. The breakfast buffet was more than enough to fill us up for the morning and we enjoyed the all-day hot drinks service in the lobby. The 24-hour pool was great in the middle of the night when we were awake due to jet-lag.

We brought our own detergent but I think the gift shop might sell single packets of powder for those in need. One negative of the hotel is its location; there's really not much in the area. Okay there are a few restaurants but not really for families or casual dining and not enough to keep you going for a whole week. There are really no other shops or cafes in the immediate vicinity. A supermarket or convenience store could be found within a 20-min walk but not closer than that. It's not a bad or dangerous neighborhood by any means, just kind of devoid of commerce. Oh, and hardly any restaurants even deliver to that neighborhood. It's just outside of the delivery range of most downtown restaurants and the few that do deliver in that area aren't very good. We were advised against some of them (reputation for yucky food) and the others that we did try were pretty awful all the same (cardboard pizza, overly-greasy stir-fry that caused bellypains).

Parking is secure and if you have a van or SUV you can park it on the upper level where the parking spaces are larger and actually designed for these larger vehicles. If you have stayed at a Silver Cloud hotel before you will know that they have a very good breakfast each morning that is included in the cost of your room. The breakfast area is very family friendly as is the whole hotel. Great place for families with kids. This is a 100% smoke free hotel which we appreciate. Also, it has been two years since we stayed at the Silver Cloud Lake Union and the biggest improvement I noticed was to the fitness area. They moved it from a tiny little room on the first floor to an outstanding room on the 3rd floor. It has lots of first-class equipment and three TV screens to watch while you are working out. My only complaint was that the mats in the fitness area were very thin and not very useful. I guess you could use two or three at once when you're doing your stretching. Aside from the mat issue though this was probably the best hotel fitness area I have seen in a long time. The hotel is also in a good area for runners or walkers and I noticed quite a few runners out by themselves which is always a good sign from a safety perspective. The shuttle service is also included in the cost of your room and will take you to downtown Seattle. We are a family of four and the shuttle service (a 10 or 12 passenger van) took us to Seattle Center, then picked us up later when we phoned for it. I'd suggest tipping the driver a couple of dollars as they do save you a lot of hassle by navigating the Seattle traffic on your behalf and save you having to pay taxi fare.

The driver was very nice, they had a car-seat for our toddler, and they left the hotel every half-hour (this has obviously changed from the once-an-hour departures of last December). We were excited by the big-screen tv in our room, as we were hoping to watch a movie on it - the only problem was, the movie I was dying to see wasn't working properly (the desk attendant said it had been watched too many times). The best part of our stay was definitely the continental breakfast - had yummy self-made waffles with strawberry sauce and yogurt, the coffee was decent (we liked that they offered free coffee in the lobby - wasn't always hot, but better than having to make it in our room), and it was a bright and spacious room. We also liked that the hotel had it's own tiny convenient store.

The negatives: The rooms are average to say the least- a little worn and small in size. My room had not been thorougly cleaned before my arrival- trash cans had not been emptied. The hotel is not near the center of the city- you need to take a public bus or use the shuttle van to go downtown, a definite negative for tourists.

The Hotel is very clean and the room was more than enough space for the three of us. Husband, wife and 14 year old daughter.

There were many items to choose from on the breakfast buffet and it was complimentary. My husband and I used the free shuttle service that the hotel offers. We took it into town for the Pioneer Village underground tour. That was so much fun. The tour guides are full of fun stories and goofy jokes. They kept the tour moving right along and you learn a bit of Seattle history. History teachers should be this amuzing. At the end of the day, you call the hotel and the shuttle bus comes to get you!

We saw a lot of families having a nice time. I wish I could say the same, but I cannot. I still feel angry about our experience here--not because a mistake in booking was made, but because the management was so rude about it. The story-- After reading a lot of good reviews, I booked this hotel for 3 adults, requesting a suite on the main floor and a disabled bathroom. (We were traveling with my elderly and disabled mother, who was in a wheelchair.) I did a lot of online research and made several phone calls to verify these points. I was really looking forward to the hotel--the reviews were good and I thought my mom would be really happy. Yet when we arrived, exhausted from a day of air travel and driving, we were informed that our room wasn't a suite, had no disabled bathroom, and wasn't on the main floor. So I asked for the manager--and waited. The manager eventually appeared. He didn't quite suggest we get lost--at least not directly --but he might as well have. His manner and words made it clear that we were a pain and a problem and it was a take-it-or-leave-it situation. I've backpacked in Europe, and roughed it in Mexico and China --- I've never been treated so dismissively. I had the clear impression he was trying to get us to leave. They eventually booked us into another room which supposedly had a disabled bathroom. Did anyone come up with us to see to it that the room was okay? No. Was it okay? No. There was no disabled bathroom AND it was next to the venting outlets AND it smelled unclean. So we went downstairs to complain again--to no avail. We would certainly have gone elsewhere but there was nothing available--believe me, I called a bunch of hotels!!. A few days later they moved us (at our strenous request) to a cleaner room. We were in town for family business, so we put the best face on it and stayed. I felt embarrassed--I had worked hard to find a place where our stay would be pleasant. My mother was also embarrassed--she went a week without a shower and thought the manager didn't want us because she was disabled. I was so angry I later wrote a long letter of complaint to the manager of public relations for the hotel chain. I stated my feeling that errors do happen (good people make mistakes), but in such situations it is appropriate to take responsibility and do what can be done to make your guests feel at home, rather than treating them like something the cat dragged in. The response? A one-sentence \"sorry there was a problem with your reservation\" from the management. Hands down, the worst travel experience ever.

We live in the Seattle area so we seldom stay at local hotels, but my husband's office Christmas party was scheduled for December 19 at the Space Needle, and we did not want to bother taking the ferry back home after the party. On the night of December 14, a massive windstorm tore through the region, toppling thousands of Douglas firs into power lines and leaving over a million people without electricity. By the morning of the 19th, we were exhausted from listening all night to our neighbors' clattering generator. My breath condensed in the 47-degree air inside our home as I packed my high heels and little black dress into a suitcase while my husband held the flashlight. \"At this point,\" I said, pulling the hood up on my parka, \"I don't care what the hotel is like as long as it has light and heat.\" We arrived to find a fairly nondescript midrise building tucked in among the office parks that line the technology corridor on the east side of Lake Union. As advertised, the hotel had free parking in a covered garage secured by an electronic gate. One of the reasons we had chosen this hotel was its free shuttle service to various Seattle attractions, including the Space Needle. The desk clerk told us the van departed every half hour, so we made reservations for 6:30 to get to the party by 7:00. The other clerk was continually fielding phone calls that were clearly from local people looking to escape their dark, frigid homes. I was pleased that the hotel had honored a request for a room on a high floor. We had to negotiate a confusing warren of poorly marked corridors to find our way from the elevators to our room, but everything was spotless, fairly new, and quiet. The room itself was a wonderful surprise. I had deliberately avoided booking a view room because I had not wanted to spend the extra money, but nevertheless our window overlooked part of Lake Union. Strangely, there was a second window that looked directly across a small recess in the building into a nearby (occupied) room a few feet away. We quickly pulled the curtain on that view. Our room was small but not uncomfortably so for two adults. There was a desk with high-speed Internet access, two overstuffed chairs, a coffee maker and and iron and ironing board, which we immediately put to use after packing in the dark. The bed was firm with lots of pillows and beautiful high-end linens. The bathroom was large and new and immaculate if not the last word in luxury. Best of all though, was the gas fireplace, which we immediately turned on to rid ourselves of the last remnants of hypothermia. We showed up in the lobby at the appointed hour to catch the shuttle, and found ourselves waiting along with a large family who were all dressed to the nines. I overheard them grumbling that they were still waiting for the 6:00 shuttle and had restaurant reservations that they were concerned about missing. Finally the patriarch went to the desk clerk and asked her to call the restaurant to say they would be delayed. The clerk did so, ignoring a teenaged member of the family's shouts to \"tell them why we're late!\" Next to her, the other clerk was answering phone calls every 15 seconds, endlessly repeating, \"I'm sorry, we're fully booked. No, I don't know of any other hotels in the area that have rooms available.\" Finally, at 6:45, the shuttle van showed up and we all piled in, but moments later the driver came around and asked everyone who wasn't going to the restaurant to please leave so they could take the family directly there. Another van showed up about five minutes later and took us to the Space Needle. After the party, my husband called the number on the card the van driver had given us. We stood shivering outside the Needle for about twenty minutes and saw no one, so we called again. It turned out that the driver had gone to a different entrance than the one at which we had been dropped off, and had been waiting for us the entire time. He came around to our side in a few minutes and brought us back to the hotel. The next morning we found a free Sunday newspaper outside our room door. After a couple of cups of coffee by the fire, we headed down to the hotel's breakfast room. Again, signage to the area was confusing, but we followed the smell of coffee and pancakes. Inside the breakfast room was an amazing scene: Dozens of families with children of all ages were crowded around the pastry trays, coffee urns and fruit bowls. Kids in pajamas and bunny slippers were making pancakes in the automated machine while their parents lounged in the easy chairs and watched football on the TVs. In the attached solarium overlooking Lake Union, the grandparents were drinking coffee and orange juice and reading the Sunday paper. It was obvious that the storm had turned what is basically a business hotel into a family room for local refugees. The hotel staff, though clearly overwhelmed during what is usually low season, handled all of it with aplomb, keeping the coffee flowing and the cereal bins filled. We obviously did not experience the Silver Cloud Inn under anything like normal circumstances, but we were impressed with its excellent value and the grace with which the staff handled the unexpected onslaught of storm-weary guests. I would definitely recommend it to the business travelers for whom it is clearly intended. As other reviewers have noted, it is not within easy walking distance to the usual Seattle tourist attractions like the waterfront and Pike Place Market, and the shuttle van service still has a few kinks to work out, but it is clean, quiet (we had absolutely no idea it was jammed with kids until we went to the breakfast room) and an excellent value in an expensive city.

I was really expecting something wonderful but really the hotel is just ok. It\u2019s nothing special. Breakfast is waffles, bagels, bread and cereal - nothing to get particularly excited about there. The free coffee is handy enough but really who gets that bothered about spending a couple of dollars on coffee during their holidays. As we discovered Seattle is not one of those cities that is nice to walk around. The hotel actually looks quite near to the Space Needle but when we tried to walk there the route really looks like some sort of demilitarised zone, with no other pedestrians, four lane highways, pavements with weeds growing out of the cracks and rundown businesses. My visions of a nice stroll to downtown Seattle sadly came to nothing. If you don\u2019t have a car don\u2019t stay here, stay downtown. I spent extra on an upgrade for a view of the lake but the lake is really not that stunning so it\u2019s really not worth spending any extra on that. The shuttle is handy but it\u2019s recommended that you book in advance and if you are downtown you have to wait for them to pick you up. As we preferred to do things on the spur of the moment we ended up getting taxis most of the time (there is a regular city bus service which runs past the hotel but I would definitely not recommend this after dark). Basically this is just a regular 3 star hotel in a not very nice location. The free internet was handy (especially when we tried to rearrange our flights to see if we could leave Seattle early). The rooms are standard 3 star rooms, absolutely nothing fancy in the way of decoration, however in our upgraded lake view room the bathroom was so small that the sink was in the bedroom and there was no wardrobe - just a space with a rail and some hangers. Reception constantly stank of disinfectant. I always spend a long time on Trip Advisor booking hotels before I go away and it\u2019s never been wrong \u2013 until now.

We had french doors that opened out on to the road, but it was frustrating that there were no privacy shades. It was pretty much either have the curtains open or closed. Since we were on the 4th floor, people could see in from across the street, so a little privacy, as opposed to no sunlight, would have been nice. There are 2 elevator areas, but the 1 elevator by our room was really slow. You could spend 2 or 3 minutes waiting, which for a building with only 7 floors was irritating. The shuttle was okay, we went to the market, and then walked to the EMP and the Space Needle. The first night we were unsure how far away we were, but it only took us about a half hour to walk, and being that it was nice out, it wasn't a problem. We took advantage of the free laundry machines, but there was only 1 washer and 1 dryer for each floor. I ran from floor to floor checking for an open machine, which was annoying. I think next time I'd just pay to have it done by dropping it at the front desk. There is wireless on the 3rd floor lounge area only, and if you want to connect in the room, you have to have your own cable. Since I'm used to wireless, I had to buy a cable in the gift shop for $5.

There was some road noise at night, not from the main road directly below, but from the free-way behind, but this didnt spoil our much needed sleep. The pool was fine, clean and towels were available in the pool area. Like others before, i agree that the lift took ages to arrive at times, which was mildly frustrating!.

First of all, it is all of maybe a mile or two from downtown. Given that they have a FREE shuttle to take you anywhere downtown or vicinity you might want to go - that's really no issue at all. Plus being outside of the downtown grid makes it more peaceful, more quiet, and much less expensive. The room was comfortable and large for this type of small hotel. The indoor pool, while I did not indulge, seemed very nice and is open 24 hours a day. There is also a free continental breakfast with, along with the usual stuff, make-your-own waffles, hard boiled eggs, and cheese. It's held in the third floor \"view\" lobby with a lovely view of the marina and lake. The \"lake view\" room is nice, but you are on the opposite side of the street from the lake. So it's not like looking out right over the water. It's over the street, and the marina, then the water. So, in my opinion, it's not really worth the extra price. The staff was uniformly excellent and helpful. The lobby is lovely with very interesting coffee table books on various places. I'd say the only \"complaint\" I had was the one main elevator was very slow. I often had to wait for a few minutes. Although, it's only 7 stories high so I did take the steps a couple of times. There is another set of elevators somewhere, but I didn't take the time to find them. If you are flying into Seattle, don't take the shuttle service offered at the airport. It was like $28 and stopped at a number of hotels. The hotel offers a town car for $35. For an extra 7 bucks I prefer the private service.

We were a family of 5 -- 2 adults and 3 teenaged boys -- so we had two rooms -- a suite and a double with 2 queen beds. They didn't connect, but they were adjoining. The shuttle runs until 11pm, which was great for our 19-year old who wanted to go off on his own in the evening. Across the street were several restaurants that worked for families: Joeys, which used to be Cucina Cucina, is an upscale restaurant with a Houston's kind of menu -- seafood/asian noodles/burgers -- with an outdoor deck and gorgeous views of Lake Union and Queen Anne's hill. Blue Water Bistro, a bit closer to the hotel, has a similar menu and view. Decent wine lists at both. Very pleasant for dinner to watch the sun go down and the lights on Queen Anne's come on. The Silver Cloud is a great place for families. However, don't expect to walk to the downtown area (such as Pike Place Market or the Space Needle). It's at least a mile across some busy streets and not very interesting neighborhoods. Take the shuttle. When it's time to head back, call the shuttle to pick you up. We never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a pick up. Twice, the shuttle was already where we were. Tip the drivers. Here's a sightseeing tip. Take the commuter ferry (at Pier 55) over to Elliott Bay in West Seattle. It's $3.00 to cross and you get a great view of the waterfront. The halibut and chips at the little fish and chips place at the dock were surprisingly good and cheap. You can take a free minibus shuttle to Alki beach.
