The only negative is that there is not too much nearby, especially in the way of restaurants, or interesting shops, but that isn't why people stay here. The rates are reasonable except perhaps when there is a concert. This resort is a great spot for intimate concerts and attracts many well known performers. You should check the schedule.

My only constructive comment has to do with the breakfast.

For the price I paid, I would have liked to see some additional options -- the same breakfast choices for four mornings just didn't cut it.

Both rooms we saw had been \"renovated\" but they still had an outdated feel, with cheap carpet and noisy air conditioners. The linens were of good quality and plentiful, however. The parking seems to be a big problem too. I don't think the charge for parking is unfair, but if they charge they need to provide a space. Everyone seems to be crammed together at one end. Additionally, the shuttle driver wanted to park in the spot we were in. Instead of just asking us to move (or clearly marking the space) he made up a story about it being an illegal spot so we would move. He then parked in the \"illegal\" spot 30 seconds later.

We were able to do alot of walking since we did not rent a car. We even caught the city bus very near the hotel to downtown and had no problem. The bikes were a fun addition to the hotel amenities so we took advantage and rode all along Shelter Island back and forth since the traffic was light through there. We walked to a couple different restaurants, Miguels (yummy), Red Sail Inn ( tried it twice and didn't like it much), The Living Room ( good lunch fare), Half Moon Inn Bar ( happy hour, 1/2 price drinks and off their 1st page menu). We were busy and outside most of the time, even sat by the pool and on our little lanai. We did have to get another room right after we arrived because there were ants crawling on the coffee bar and wall plus my husband took a shower and the tub would not drain. It didn't seem to be a problem to get another room and the next room was a little more updated than the first. I could still smell kind of a musty smell upon entry to the room but it was clean, no ants, and the tub worked! Everyone seemed pleasant, especially Bill, always wanting to help. I think the hotel is just really old and even with some of the room \"updates\" there are moisture problems. The landscaping is beautiful, lots of mature palms, koi pond ( the biggest Koi I have ever seen), 2 parrots, very tidy grounds. It was nice to see the marinas, the bay, and to be able to walk around and not worry about safety. The airport is close by, the noise did not bother us, as the hotel filled up towards the end of our stay it got a little noisy, maybe best to get a second floor room.

By researching deals and ratings, I found Humphreys and there was a really good 48 hour sale going on. The reviews were pretty respectable so I settled on it. Check in was really smooth, and the front desk was very helpful. They gave a map so that we could easily find our room, they gave us a menu so we could see some of the dishes that their restaurant offered (Which was good so that I could see if it was worth going there since I don't like seafood), and we heard recommendations being made as to other things we should do whilst there. After reading reviews from others at different hotels, I was relieved that I didn't have to prove that I had paid for the room or anything (although I had the paperwork all ready to go just in case). The place itself was not very far from everything, and the view of the marina was absolutely beautiful. We didn't see any of the concerts by the bay while we were there but the area was big and hopefully we'll do that next time. PARKING: We found the room, and on a Wednesday we had no problem parking near our room at all (Parking is an extra ten dollars a night). Parking did get a bit crazy by Thursday night and Friday, so that's when you'll want to get back a bit early (although the walk isn't far at all it's just less convenient when you have to check out in the morning). THE GROUNDS: The grounds are very nice, with one exception being the area Caution-stripped out but that didn't bother me. I felt really safe while I was here. We were able to walk the grounds at night and we didn't feel nervous at all. We saw other people but there were no rowdy and loud voices, suspicious activity or anything like that. The only time there was a good amount of noise was in the morning because people were waking up and whatnot. There was a small fitness center located under the Ballroom by the bay, which was perfect during the week especially when everything was quite empty. The pool was unexpectedly big and I was very happy with the effect. Make sure to walk around and find the parrots that hang out above the koi pond! ROOM: The room itself was a renovated Premier King room. The bed was comfortable, the TV was a good size and had HDMI so I could plug in my phone for my own movies. There were three lamps and each turned on differently, but they were set up in a very convenient way. There is a complimentary Nintendo Gamecube in the room that can be played 60 minutes for around 7 dollars (games can be chosen on screen), which I thought was really funny and cool. The decoration was very pretty and I enjoyed the white bedspread as opposed to the cheap looking floral you see in other places. The bathroom was nice and the fan was really quiet. The bed was wonderfully spacious, although it wasn't as comfortable as back home... Now I want a king size bed. I do wish I could have found a TV guide or something since the channels were completely different than they are in the Inland Empire so I had to go through one by one to find anything. Not a big deal, just something I thought I would mention. The little patio area was wonderful because it was covered by plants and things so that we had privacy, whereas there were others that were just completely out in the open. I was very happy and surprised to see that they had a mini fridge and a microwave in the room. They came in handy the entire stay, and the fridge wasn't bulked up with anything which meant that I didn't have to remember what was mine and what was extra. Housekeeping did an amazing job every time they were there. No old towels were left, and the first day we used pretty much all of the little shampoo and conditioner and they were replaced with twice as many bottles the next day without our asking for it. Oh, and ice being free was great! LOBBY: Check out time being at 12? Marvelous! I had plenty of time to wake up normally, get ready for my day and check out. Check out was smooth and quick, there were smiles and more tips from the woman at the front desk. I saw three people behind the desk during my stay and all were quick to offer up tips and suggestions. They seemed very knowledgeable and didn't seem like they were grinding their teeth behind their smiles. OVERALL: I had a wonderful stay at Humphreys and I definitely plan on being back here. I was honestly sad when I had to leave my room. This place was perfect for me and my boyfriend, and we congratulated ourselves on a job well done with picking this beautiful place.

The half moon was beautifully landscaped with a lush Polynesian/Hawiian/tropical feel, and the rooms were very clean and simply decorated to match the vibe. Also, the staff was both helpful and friendly. Views from right outside were amazing, day and night. We were worried about noise from the airport due to viewing google maps, however, we did not hear one plane the entire time, and could only hear military choppers when out at shoreline park, maybe once or twice. It is a very relaxing and peaceful place to be. Now the bad. Maybe we are spoiled from our bed at home, but the beds were the least comfortable we have slept on in years, and this is after driving and sightseeing since 430 am. Also, the pool and spa were relaxing, but could have and should have been cleaner, as some algae was present, but we soaked anyway, and so did several others. Conclusion: definitely not 5star luxury, but a great place to stay if you do not need to be in the fanciest hotel, but want to relax in peace.

My husband tried calling them but they would not answer their phone so he had to go stand in the long line again to get soap. The air conditioning in the room was a joke. It provided more noise than air. We would be sweating all night, then walk out in the morning to discover it was actually cool outside. The ocean winds serve as a better cooling system.

King size bed had great big fluffy pillows, extra blankets & pillows in the closet and another flat screen tv.

It is situated on Shelter Island right next to San Diego harbor with nice views of the Skyline and the south side of point loma. Pros: - Close to most attractions San Diego has to offer including Balboa park, Sea World, Torrey Pines, etc. - About 300 yards to the water. There is a small beach on the bay within walking distance as well. - Renovated rooms are very nice. We had one right next to the lobby so not the best location in the hotel but the room made up for it. It was clean with new looking furniture, appliances, and decor and the bed was very nice with wonderful sheets and pillows. - On site stage with almost weekly entertainment. While we were there, the Indigo Girls were playing. Not my cup of tea but there is a long list of entertainers that perform there. - The grounds are very immaculate with large greenery everywhere. There is also a nice sized pool and jacuzzi area with an outdoor bar that is a great place to relax. - On site restaurant has a great view of the boat harbor and was directly over the water. They frequently have sea lions swimming around under the large viewing windows. Also cool to see the big private yachts lumbering around. Cons: - Our room was on the first floor and had absolutely no view even though we were kind of facing the water. There was a small porch area but it was completely fenced in with bamboo from foot to ceiling for privacy. Most of the 2nd story rooms we saw had balconies with better views but these may be more expensive. - As a whole, the resort is somewhat small. The rooms are big enough for sleeping and general living but just not big enough to sit and have a meal or do work on the computer. - There is a daily charge for parking and no close parking that is free. They tell you about this when you make your reservation. In general, this is one of the cheaper places you can find so close to the water and is better than 3 stars. The building is older but they are renovating all the rooms and these rooms are great. Special tips from a local for those who read the whole review: - Point Loma Seafoods is a fantastic deli/fresh fishery. If you go, try the tuna fish sandwich, it is the best I have ever had. Also, get the white clam chowder on the side. You will find this place just around the corner from the hotel on Scott St. - Red Sails Inn: Even closer to the hotel is this wonderful little restaurant. You'll pass it every time you enter and exit Shelter Island. It is a great place for a romantic dinner or just relaxing at the bar. Try their shrimp salad as it is LOADED with shrimp and big enough for 2. - Miguel's mexican food: Again right around the corner from the hotel and a great sit down mexican joint.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGetting ready to head back to paradise!\u201d", "Author": "nuthatch12", "ReviewID": "UR118012542", "Content": "Finally writing a long overdue review as we get ready to return!

Our room was spacious; we chose the Grand Marina Suite for its full kitchen, room to play with our toddler, and separate bedroom to let him nap while we continued to enjoy the living areas. We really enjoyed our balcony with a beautiful view of the marina, just as you might picture a perfect San Diego view: water, sun, and boats. Peaceful and serene. Enjoyed showing our little guy the divers cleaning barnacles off the boats just below us. Had breakfast each morning in the restaurant; white tablecoths and a table at the window looking out on the marina. The servers always remembered our son's name and gave him lots of attention. We also had dinner there our first night (stayed 3 nights), and though we were nervous about taking our toddler into a fine dining restaurant in the evening, they were so welcoming that they put us and our son at ease, helped keep him content, and other guests actually came over to compliment us on our happy little guy. So glad we tried it; the food was delicious and they were extraordinarily accomodating of our modification requests due to our special diets.

Definitely give them a call before making reservations--even if you like concerts, you might not like the band that's playing.

The first room we were given was a garden view. The room was dark cave like with only the slider leading to the tiny patio for light. The patio literally had room for two small chairs only. The walkway was 2 ft. from the chairs so no privacy. You would have to keep your blinds closed all the time because of the close walkway. We were moved to a room on the second floor facing the parking lot. At least we could look across the road to the bay and be able to have our windows open and still have privacy. The traffic was loud though, especially on concert days. We had read that they have concerts but didn't realize they were 4 nights a week. The stage is only about 20 ft from one end of the pool with the rooms all around the pool so you deal with loud booming music until almost 11 p.m. most nights. One afternoon we thought we would lounge at the pool but the band was practicing. If you like loud obnoxious noise instead of peace and tranquility then this is the place. There were never enough lounge chairs by the pool either so not enough seating. They try and make the grounds tropical and they weren't bad but not Hawaii for sure. The carpet in our room was stained and there was mold around the tub by the caulking. They tried to make the place nice but it is old and it shows. Having to pay for parking was also an added cost. When checking out, we had to wait for a long time because someone charged drinks from the bar to our room. They inconvenienced us while they tried to track down what happened.

We enjoyed it thoroughly and would highly recommend it for a relaxing vacation. The atmosphere is that of the \"Tiki Culture\" so popular in the 1950s and 60s. I could see how it would not be everyone's cup of tea. But I really enjoyed this and found it to be a refreshing alternative to modern, corporate hotel compounds. Humphrey's Half Moon Inn is located on Shelter Island which is a narrow spit of land jutting into San Diego Harbor. On one side of the island is a very large boat marina. On the other side is the harbor. Although our room faced the main road, there was minimal traffic during the day and almost none at night. We could also sometimes hear airliners across the harbor at the airport and an occasional Navy helicopter during the day. But this was far from bothersome and non-existent by bed time. Near the hotel are multiple restaurants within walking distance or a very short drive. We tried the Humphrey's restaurant for dinner on our first night. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it. It was OK at best and overpriced for the food quality and quantity; and we used 25% off coupons provided by the front desk. Also, the decor is the proverbial, sterile, contemporary ensemble of gray, beige and chrome (yawn). Our table was right against a very large window which should have provided a spectacular view of the marina and lights of nearby Point Loma. Alas, the window glass is highly reflective and offers mostly muted, mirror images of the restaurant. I expect the views are quite nice during the day. In stark contrast, directly next to the restaurant is a club with nightly music. The jazz band playing there during our dinner was amazing and threw down well into the night. This place looks like a lot of fun. One of the best features of Humphrey's is the pool. It's much larger than I would have expected and sits inside the inn's lushly landscaped courtyard. Since it was built many years ago, it has a nine foot deep end. (Completely absent in modern hotel pools.) Although diving isn't technically allowed, consider yourself warned and have fun jumping into the deep end. Or, you can casually splash about in the larger shallow end. Directly next to the pool is a good-sized spa and a pool bar. Strangely, the pool bar shuts down early unless a concert is going on. I can only assume they prefer guests visit the night club or restaurant for drinks. Food is also available at the pool bar. Our room was not large, but was of adequate size and featured a good quality king bed with nice linens. The entire inn appears to be of post and beam construction with attractive wood features inside. The squeaky-clean bathroom fixtures were modern and of very high quality. Our room had no air conditioning; only a fan. We were a bit concerned about this initially, but soon learned the breezes off the bay keep Shelter Island beautifully pleasant during the day and downright cool at night; even in late July! My favorite part of our first-floor room was the small, semi-secluded patio. On one end of the room were three attractive wooden blinds stretching from floor-to-ceiling. Pushing these blinds to the side revealed a sliding glass door and an outdoor sitting area with a bamboo screen on one side and tropical plants on two sides. I thoroughly enjoyed reading on this patio in the absolutely spectacular weather of Shelter Island. Hint: if you too would like to read on the patio, bring a book light as there is no lighting in the area after dark. Every member of the Humphrey's staff we encountered was pleasant and polite. We purchased discount tickets to local attractions at the front desk which was very convenient. You can even check out a bike which is complementary for two hours. Be aware there is a $10.00 per day parking fee, but parking is quite scarce on Shelter Island.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincolnshire", "Title": "\u201cWe'll be back for sure\"\u201d", "Author": "JumbleLincolnshire", "ReviewID": "UR115983078", "Content": "Humphrey's Inn and Suites has a wonderful location on Shelter Island.

I stayed here once with my family when I was only about 10 years old and I always vowed to go back, and I did, now I am 24! It was even nicer than I remember (they recently had a refurbishment). We drove from LA airport as we had flown in from London and it was a lovely scenic drive that took around 2 hours. The hotel is based right on the harbour giving stunning views of the whole city and the boats. Prior to our trip I had contacted the hotel to book in for the champagne jazz brunch that they hold on Sundays as that was my boyfriends birthday and they were so helpful and reserved us their best table. Not only that on arrival because they knew it was his birthday, we were upgraded to a bigger more superior room and as we entered we found a bottle of champagne and a birthday card from the hotel which was a lovely personal touch to kick start our holiday. The rooms are now very modern, large, comfortable queen bed, plasma TV with a wide choice of channels and films if you want a night in. Bathrooms were superbly clean, floor to ceiling in marble, with an Hawaiin feel and every day you were stocked up with new toiletries. The room also had a dressing area with mirror, coffee machine and fridge which is really helpful if you just want to go to the supermarket and get some water etc. The room service was fantastic and you never have to ask for anything twice and the reception staff are absolutely wonderful and do all they can to help you with trips, excursions and discount vouchers for Sea World, San Diego Zoo etc. The one thing that completely stands out at this hotel for me is the restaurant, it is hands down the best breakfast I have EVER had and I have stayed in higher rated hotels before but nothing comes close to here, we ate in there every day because we couldn't miss out on it and we knew we wouldnt find any better. Another thing I would 100% recommend is the jazz brunch for $35 each you get unlimited champagne and access to their buffet brunch and wow, you have NEVER seen a brunch like this. Eggs of any kind, breads of all kind, fish of all kinds, cheese of all kind, fresh pasta cooked to your taste, roasted meats, grilled meats, the biggest dessert selection you have ever seen including the most amazing chocolate covered strawberries. All this amazing food is accompanied by the jazz singers who sing an array of classic songs as well as any songs you wish to request and they make a real deal of anyone who is there for a special occasion, get you up on stage, sing to you and then you get a free dessert with a little candle, again a lovely touch. The swimming pool is lovely and clean and quite large, it also has a small jacuzzi which is lovely, especially if the clouds are out and the sun has gone in. There are always plenty of sunbeds and beautiful palm trees close you in, so you feel secluded and safe, especially as there are security gates to get to the pool area which you can only get access with a room key. There is a pool service throughout the day including pool snacks and amazing cocktails too. There really isn't anything i can fault this hotel on and I would recommend it to anyone. It is 5 minutes from Sea World, 15 mins if that from the zoo and just a short 5 minute drive to the main City to Gaslamp disctrict etc. The hotel provide you with driving directions, maps and recomendations for resturants too which is very helpful. My personal musts are: Sea World (we did the Artic experience which included swimming with beluga whales which was amazing and so worth the money, book in advance if you want to do this or get to the parl early) San Diego Zoo Dinner Cruise at the Harbour which can be booked online in advance Eat in the hotel as much as possible (dinner is great too) and also a small italian covered in candles making it really romantic and very authentic italian called Little Venice. It is around a 2 minute drive. All in all San Diego was amazing and Humpreys topped it all off.

Traffic was light, so not bothersome. Grounds are very nice \u2013 with a tropical vibe to it. (Although why pretend you are in Hawaii when you are in San Diego of all places?). I did not observe any loud parties during my mid-week stay; I saw mostly people with kids, retirees \u2013 it was very quiet throughout the grounds. The real problem for me was poor insulation from inside/outside the room. I could hear my neighbors talking in the evening, people walking outside, work crew loading up hotel\u2019s construction materials at 11:30 pm outside, and again my neighbors either talking on the phone or watching TV starting at 5:30 am, or earlier (it\u2019s a blur now). If I were to pay the regular rate ($230 for a king room or even higher later in the summer), I\u2019d rather stay in one of the newer bay front hotels downtown. Poor insulation/sleep quality was a deal breaker for me. In summary, your enjoyment of the hotel would depend on the rate you get; location of your room; and how loud/quiet your neighbors are.

Clearly, they have not experienced the sprawling, gorgeous, beautiful Marina View Suites, which are very reasonably priced. In my experience, if you book the cheapest room on the property, you get what you pay for. I average 44+ nights a year in hotels, so suggest paying a little more for a room that you will be happy with. It is a good idea to inquire directly with the hotel staff so they can accommodate your wishes, and suggest a room, or suite that you would be more comfortable in. The grounds, pool area, and restaurants are pristine, and quite lovely. Service is impeccable. I love this property! I am a Hilton Hhonors Diamond VIP, and travel frequently, and always choose this fabulous independent property on Shelter Island, when visiting San Diego. The GM, Sergio Davies, is wonderful~ Management sets the tone and it certainly shows as I have stayed at Humphrey's 4 times in the past year, and have never had one complaint. The management of this property is extraordinary, and precise. The room service, in-suite dining, and restaurant have been exceptional.

I signed up for email notifications for the hotel and received a promotional email that we decided to take advantage of. The package included a great rate, free parking, bike rental and 2 for 1 dining vocher. When we arrived to the hotel to check in, it was a different story. In short, we argued with the front desk staff who stated this was not the package we booked and refused to honor their advertised rate/package. The staff was terribly rude. It was my own fault for not printing out the confirmation confirming these added perks (I did not think it would be an issue at check-in). Now I am sitting here typing looking at the print out which I didn't have with me at the time that states the free things we should receive but never did. I checked my bank statement today to show that I had been charged for parking when I shouldn't have. I called the hotel once again to get the refund which they still refused. The hotel would rather argue over $20 and lose a customer for life. We visit San Diego 4 times a year and would have brought great business.

I was central to so many things I wanted to do-- research at the library downtown, shopping nearby, a close drive to the Coronado bridge for a visit to the Hotel del Coronado, and Ocean Beach for some antiquing. I was here for loads of genealogical research, so was usually gone all day, and wanted to enjoy the room at night. Problem was that certain things that SHOULD have been updated have not. Problem #1- During the day, my room was nice, with a sliding glass door and nice patio onto the tropical courtyard. Wooden louvered shutters slid over the glass doors, providing adequate privacy, so that was good. But at night, it was TOO DARK!! There was only a small desk lamp and a small bedside table lamp. Because the ceilings are wooden-beamed, I assume that overhead fixtures might be a fire hazard. BUT they need some extra floor lamps or something. It is just too dark to be able to do much. And I needed to work on my computer at night to plan what I needed to research the next day. #2- There are VERY FEW outlets in the room. My main problem was that I wanted to be able to research on my computer while watching TV at night. There is ONE outlet along that wall. Meaning TV and computer, or lamp and computer, or lamp and TV. Not all three. With so little light in the room already, I couldn't think about not turning on the lamp at all. So I finally had to set my desk lamp on the nearby occasional chair. #3- I believe one other reviewer mentioned it too. The cable channel selection SUCKS. Out of about maybe 20 channels, you get THREE sports channels, one of which is all Padres. And Fox News. Yay. I was really looking forward to checking out the season premier of White Collar on USA, but they don't get it. Without TNT and the occasional Law and Order there, or a few shows on the Discovery channel, I would have just kept the stupid thing off. There are some really great things about Humphrey's.

Finally, I noticed that there was a New Year's Eve party advertised on the web site, so I called the hotel and was told that I couldn't reserve over the phone (even with a credit card) but that they would have to either fax or mail (no e-mail) a form for me to fill out and fax or mail back. Are you kidding me???? I gave the employee my address to mail me the form, and then she put me on hold for 8 minutes -- why? Finally, I hung up and they never mailed me the form so we didn't get to go to the New Year's Eve party, even though we were staying at the hotel. When we got to the hotel we asked the receptionist if there were any reservations for the party available as a staff member had told us there were, and she was quite abrupt and curt and told us we had been misinformed and that there were no reservations available. No apology, no attempt to help us find something else, just a very snotty no. That's okay, we went across the street to Bali Hai, which happily accepted our Open Table reservations and we probably had a better time there anyway.

The staff for breakfast gave very good service. We stayed here twice and the rooms varied in size and location. Poolside rooms were the best - we got free upgrades as we didn't like the roadside room we had booked as we could hear the (light) traffic. We didn't stay in a marina side room but I would imagine they are best of all. One note of caution in the rooms - the fans in the bathrooms are VERY noisy. We were woken one morning by our 4 neighbours putting on the fan for their morning showers and it was 5am! This is one thing the hotel needs to upgrade. However we were very happy here. It was so relaxing and beautiful and we would definitely stay here again. You need a car to get into the main parts of San Diego (there may be public transport but you certainly can't walk!) and restaurants that you can walk to from here are few. Humphrey's have a music thing going on - there are concerts on an outdoor stage in the hotel in non-winter months and they have live music every night adjacent to the restaurant. It wasn't noisy in our rooms though, it just meant we didn't want to eat there.", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rock Island, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our stay!\u201d", "Author": "MissiCAD", "ReviewID": "UR87177510", "Content": "We went to San Diego for a conference and built in a few extra days to see the area & enjoy ourselves.

I was looking for a resort type hotel for the end of our trip and this was it and it exceeded our expectations. 1. I normally would have booked the least expensive room but it was not avail. but now I\u2019m glad I spent a little more because we had a renovated room ( # 129) with a patio steps away from the pool. Arriving at 10:30 AM there was a room ready but I wanted one close to the pool and the 1st floor so we came back later. We booked the hotel on their website and it was less expensive to get the zoo package ($111. night and 2 zoo tkts) then to get the room without the tickets. Room # 129 was steps away from the pool. It was recently renovated and gorgeous \u2013 spacious, wood beamed ceiling, modern bathroom with designer bowl sink, safe, nice size refrig and m/w with lots of shelves to keep our breakfast food which we got at nearby VONS supermarket. Can\u2019t forget to mention the big flat screen TV (42\u201d maybe). Very comfy pillowtop mattress beds. This room had sliding doors leading to a patio. Some second floor rooms have a balcony. I believe the lower priced rooms do not have the patio or balcony. 2. Pool is big especially compared to the 2 other hotels we stayed in and others we saw in San Diego. There is also a pool bar, towels provided at the pool, a nice size \u2018hot\u2019 hot tub and ping pong table. 3. They have decent bicycles and you get 2 hrs complementary per day. My family took advantage of this and used them for 3 days bicycling around the marinas and even biking to nearby Harbor Island. Although the chains did fall off 2 of the bicycles. 4. On part of the property is Humphrey\u2019s Outdoor theatre \u2013 a small theatre with big name entertainment.. We lucked out as the 1st night we checked in \u201cThree Dog Night\u201d played. You are not able to see the stage as the rooms are located behind it (except for a few rooms that do overlook the stage) but we certainly could hear the music. Check out their concert schedule (Diana Ross, Sheryl Crow, Jackson Browne, etc \u2013 I was told some of them sell out in 10 minutes) 5. There is another area where there is live music other nights (Billy Joel tribute band while we were there) and I found out at check-out hotel guests are allowed to go for free \u2013 although I read the welcome e-mail after we got home and it did say this.. 6. The hotel grounds are beautiful and smaller than I expected \u2013 check out the fish ponds, marina, and putting green. 7. There is a restaurant with room service but we didn\u2019t try it. We went to nearby Joao\u2019s A Tin Fish Bar and Eatery in Pt. Loma using restaurant.com $25 off and I had one of the best fish meals I have ever eaten. Also the BK\u2019s brewery chain offers a not publicized great 2 for $20 special \u2013 1 med. Speciality pizza, soup and salad, and dessert. There are many restaurants nearby including fast food ones. 8. Two computers with a printer located in the lobby \u2013 nice gesture as we used it to print our boarding passes. Also free wi-fi in the rooms. 9. When we were checking in, one person requested later check-out and she was given 12:30 the latest (12:00 is regular check-out). The day we were to leave I asked for later check-out and we were given 1:00pm. 10. Parking is an extra $10 per night and you use your room key to put up the gate. During concert nights, there is a guard at the gate to make sure only hotel guests use the lot. 11. There is fitness center but it is small, about 4 pieces of equipment. There is nothing negative about this hotel, except I did ask twice for the outside patio light to be fixed which is wasn\u2019t but that really is inconsequential. For more money I was considering the Hilton or Sheraton but I am so glad I didn\u2019t.

The customer service varies. Housekeeping and room service staff are among some of the nicest people I've encountered when traveling. (The room service menu is excellent by the way and the french toast is to die for.) The front desk can be a challenge. They frequently seem to be short handed or have someone a little inept working during the prime check in/out times and if the computer in the business center isn't working, there doesn't seem to be anyone on-site to help. If you can get one of the renovated rooms, I would highly recommend chosing Humphreys for your next trip to San Diego.

Not a very good call on my part. Our stay did not start off very well. We showed up promptly at 4pm, which their policy states is their check-in time. However there was only one person manning the desk. With only 2 customers in front of us, I didn't think we would have long to wait. 20 minutes later, we finally get to check-in. By that time, there were an additional 6 people behind us - that is NOT an exaggeration! I booked through the hotel's website months ago for a waterview deluxe junior suite. Checking in, the staff starts off \"oh we have some great upgrages for you, we're giving you this larger garden view and pool view suite\" WT . . .! I booked a waterview room so I could see OCEAN, not pool water! I told her thanks, but no thank you, I booked a waterview suite, and that's what I wanted. We did get the waterview room that we asked for, but beware of the location of your room. Ours was closest to the end, nearest to the restaurant, in building A. Which also happens to be an entrance/exit for their concert venue. Which also happens to be the location of the port-o-potties. Folks, there's has to got be a better place for those! Thanks goodness it never really got hot while we were there, because they leave the doors to the building open - I can't imagine what the hallways would smell like on nice warm day! The hotel room was ok - I will be posting some pictures of some things in the room that were somewhat questionable. I thought the walls were too thin - hallway noise, but that's pretty typical in most hotels, but you could hear when our \"neighbor\" was moving things around, we think, in their closet. The patio was really too small to sit out on all the time or even comfortably (it was one of their diagonal ones), plus the chairs looked really too filthy to sit on - I used towels to cover them just so we wouldn't feel the ick factor. We did enjoy the view immensely, and is the only reason we're giving three stars instead of the one star that I wanted to give. We stayed on the San Diego bay side (verses the marina side), which we did not regret. If you're a big boating/navy enthusiast, you will get to see a lot of traffic going in and out of the harbor. Not to mention all the planes (if you don't mind the occasional jet take-off noise), that we got to see take off from the naval base on Coronado. Please keep in mind, if you stay on the SD bay side your first view will be of the parking lot, then of the road, then of the water. It's not very private, and if you have a too small balcony, not very relaxing, but it was fun watching the show.

We always have a great relaxing time. What makes Humprey's our choice is the suites. We have and teen and elementary girls and two 2 year old twins. A standard room just doesn't cut it anymore. Having lots of room and a full kitchen makes for a much more pleasant stay.We booked a Grand marina suite for the first week of August. When we arrived, the room was a mess! The carpet was dirty and there were several large red stains (looked like spilled drinks). The patio was covered in mashed in bread and food, and there were half empty water bottles and dozens and dozens of cigarette butts. Okay, dirty floors and cig butts and not cool when you have two toddlers! We called the front desk and someone came and cleaned up some (not all) of the mess outside. I talked to someone at the front counter who sounded sorry, but didn't really do anything. She said she would tell the manager. The first night was awful. My wife walked around in white socks and after a couple of hours the bottoms were BLACK. It was so bad we talked about leaving the next morning and just going home. That night I read the postings on tripadvisor and saw that Dawn Sanders responded to a few. The next morning my wife and I asked to meet with Dawn in private. I explained what had happened and our disappointment in our favorite hotel. Dawn was genuinely concerned, explained that the suites had not yet been renovated. I told her that the room was okay...it just needed a real good cleaning and that the cleaning staff didn't seem motivated to fix problems that were pointed out. Dawn understood and asked for a chance to make it right or send us to another property for the rest of the week. While we were out Dawn had our carpets cleaned with a \"dry foam\" that made a huge difference. The red stains were all but gone and out feet stayed clean when walking on the carpet. I think they should clean the carpets at least once a week. Here's the nice part. I specifically told Dawn that the money really wasn't the issue for us...we just wanted a nice vacation in a clean hotel with our kids and we would pay more to stay elsewhere if need be. But after the room was cleaned to our satisfaction Dawn knocked half off our first night's stay. And then send a nice fruit/cookie/coffee platter to our room one of the nights (a REAL hit with the kids). They also sent a note offering us a free in room movie that week. All in all, Dawn KNOWS how to take care of customers. She couldn't make the room perfect (it is older...) but she went above and beyond in making us feel liked valued guests. I ate at the restaurant a couple of times with the older girls that week...a bit pricey, but really good! On our last day we checked out and Dawn was there. I asked for another 25% discount voucher because we were going to grab a quick lunch with all the kids and then drive home. After settling the bill, Dawn gave me a certificate that paid for lunch for everyone. We already were happy with the hotel...we already paid the bill. But Dawn bought us lunch on the way out anyway. Again, Dawn Sanders is a great asset to Humphrey's! We WILL be back! The moral of the story is this: if you have ANY issues, don't complain, don't grumble, and don't keep it to yourself.

My husband and I along with our two children and their friends stayed at this wonderful hotel. We had previously stayed at a new hotel downtown attending a conference June 25 and 26. While the new hotel was beautiful it was extremely expensive and ultimately not as kid friendly as Humphreys was. The staff at Humphreys went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. I visited Humphreys a day ahead of our check in to make sure we were getting a room that would work well for our family - we had reserved a suite and a regular room and wanted to make sure the kids were fairly close to us for safety purposes. I called the next day and the reservationist was able to share with me the rooms that had been assigned to us and really put my anxiety to rest. She did her best to put the kids close to us and gave us a room we were thrilled with - the view was great and we were more than satisfied. We checked in that afternoon and the kids were thrilled with the tropical atmosphere of the entire hotel. Being able to check our emails in the lobby was super, the pool was great and the service around the pool superior as well. In fact our last day we stayed at the hotel and lounged around the pool, ate room service and drinks by the pool. The service staff was always friendly and efficient. Our vehicle was hit in the parking lot and the security personnel was right on it because the driver drove away. He was able to secure a license plate from a hotel guest and went above and beyond to make sure harbor police was called and followed up to make sure our needs were met. Wow what a great experience given the circumstance. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. They are in the process of modernizing all the rooms and that will prove to be great. One of our rooms was completed and the flat screen tvs, bed linens and all was superior. While our suite was older it still was very nice and we were very pleased. The toaster, pots and pans were older and some didn't work well but when I brought it to the attention of staff they indicated all I had to do was ask and they would be replaced. The TV in our bedroom didn't work at 10 p.m. one night - a staff period replaced the tv and made sure our needs were met - everything we asked was met with incredible service.

We expected to pay for parking as this is the case with most of the hotels in the area and I was warned of this on my reservation -- there is public parking across the street for the thrifty. The only downfall was our room. We reserved a junior suite and the room was small and the furnishings were very dated. The room was in Bldg A and was in desperate need of an update (furnishings/wallpaper/comforter) and strangely you enter the suite through the bedroom not the living room area and room set-up was definitely awkward.

The suite had a king-size bed, plenty of closet space, a kitchenette fully-stocked with cutlery, plates, etc.. The bathroom was a pleasant surprise, with marble counter tops and ample space. Two sinks made it very easy for us to prepare at the same time, unlike many hotels we have stayed in. The grounds are FANTASTIC, with well-kept foliage reminding us of our trip to Hawaii. The pool area was always busy, even though it was a bit chilly (65-70 degrees). I particularly enjoyed the two parrots that are perched above the koi pond. I very nice touch of the tropics. The concert venue is very impressive. The stage was not used while we were there, but I can see why such great bands would wish to perform there. A beautiful, yet intimate concert environment, overlooking the marina and surrounded by the beautiful, tropical gardens of the Half Moon Inn. Although my wife and I enjoyed the service of the staff, the clean, spacious, very comfortable rooms, and the outstandingly beautiful campus, I do have a complaint that has been made in previous posts I have read on this site. I found that the room that we were provided, which I am certain is one of the more expensive rooms available, was extremely poor as far as noise abatement. I could literally hear EVERY word that the neighbors were saying next door if I stood in our closet area. The ventilation system served as a direct line of communication between the two suites. The room which adjoined our bedroom was not occupied on our first night, and I slept like a baby. The comfort of the pillows and linens was 5-star, certainly meeting the standard of some of the best hotels we have stayed in around the world. The final night of our stay, however, was a nightmare! I heard the couple whose bed was on the other side of the wall from our bed were talking into the \"wee hours\", and I could literally hear every word. I decided that instead of making my wife uspet on our last night, for she was sleeping like a baby throughout the conversation next door, I decided to sleep in the sofa in the living room. If I had knocked on the wall it would have escalated into a confrontation, and that is not what we expected when we booked our stay at the Half Moon Inn. A final word of advice to those who stay in room 422...the drapes do NOT close completely in the bedroom, and the morning light can wake you up very early.

We were initially trying to decide between this hotel and a beautiful 4 star hotel downtown where public transportation is easier. I called Humphrey's and asked how guests can get around from the hotel and was told that there was a complimentary shuttle to the airport. Seeing that buses leave from the airport, we booked Humphrey's and saved a few dollars. When our flight got into the airport at 11pm, I called the hotel and asked for the shuttle. I was told that the shuttle ended at 11 pm, but to take a cab and get a receipt and we would be reimbursed at the end of our stay. We used the hotel shuttle to get to the airport two days to take the bus downtown, and once to pick up our rental car. No one ever told us that we were not allowed to be using the shuttle this way. Nor is it explicitly stated anywhere. It DOES NOT say \"Arrivals and departures only\" anywhere. Upon checkout, I asked Melissa at the front desk about the cab reimbursement. I was told, forcefully and indignantly, that \"Absolutely not! We will not reimburse you!\" because that was not their policy. It didn't matter that we were told this by the front desk when we first called. We were, I kid you not, YELLED at by Melissa in the lobby in front of other guests, because we had used the shuttle to go to the airport on consecutive days. We were essentially accused of lying about what we were told by the staff on the first night, and essentially accused of trying to get away with something by using the shuttle in the way we did. So, not only did we not get reimbursed when we were told we would, we were humiliated in the lobby in the process. I have never been treated this way by someone in customer service!

We stayed at this hotel for four nights. My mother stayed additional evening. We arrived at the airport at 10:15 am and I called the hotel to let them know we had arrived and if there was a possibility of checking in early. The lady was very friendly and told me she would let housekeeping know we would be an early check-in. We went to get our rental car and by the time we got to Humphrey's our room was ready. We asked at check-in for a roll away bed and it was delivered within five minutes of getting into our room. They showed us a map of the property and gave us a choice of room location. We picked a second floor room overlooking the bay. No disappointments there. We enjoyed the view a lot. The naval base is directly across the bay and we saw helicopters and huge ships coming and going. We even saw planes taking off from an aircraft carrier. We saw cruise ships and harbor tour boats also. We had a Waterview Jr. Suite. It had a king bed and a sofa bed. Plus the roll away bed. Plenty of room for four of us. Seeing we didn't spend a whole lot of time in our room. They do not have rooms with two bathrooms so I was worried about all of us getting ready in the mornings. There is a sink with a large mirror between the bedroom area and sitting area. So that could be used for getting ready. There is a sink and vanity outside the shower/toilet area. Plenty of drawers and closet space. The room was cleaned nicely everyday. The front desk staff were fantastic. If we'd ask if there was a Pizza place we could order from they had menus handy and would print directions to anywhere you needed. They printed us directions to a Walgreens. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble. The concierge was very helpful also. They suggested a Mexican restaurant a few blocks away and gave us a coupon for a free appetizer. The appetizer was great and so was everything else at the restaurant. It is Miguel's. The food was very good and the staff were great there too. We ate there twice. After graduation we took a group of 13 there. We had a little one with us and the wait would have been 45 minutes for a table. But, they set up a table for us outside. It was probably about 72 degrees and it was so special for my son's family to all be together having a great meal and eating outside was a treat. Seeing at home it was around zero degrees. My hubyy and I went whale watching and my mom and daughter went to Sea World. My mom and I drove to La Jolla to see sea lions and my mom went to the Zoo also. Nice area. Loved San Diego. The front desk has information or discount coupons for all events in the area. The bar at Humpohrey's is nice. A bit pricey, compared to our midwestern bars, but there really isn't a comparison. Great live music. Reggae one night. It was great to be out and dancing. So festive feeling. We really felt like the whole stay was a celebration. Nothing to complain about. There are going to be doing some remodeling of the lobby area. From what we were told they are redoing the gift shop area and adding more seating and lounge area to the lobby. So everything in the gift shop was 70% off. Great deals. I bought a really nice hooded fancier type fleece jacket for $9 and because it was the last jacket they let me get the matching pants for free. I got another really nice San Diego (collegiate type lettered) sweatshirt for less than $7. We got other t-shirts and goodies too. When my hubby went into buy a soda they looked at me and said \"oh you have supported our sale so much we won't charge you for the soda\". My husband was like \"how much money did you spend here?\" Really not a lot at all. Anyway, our stay was great and I would recommend this hotel if you are in the area.

I even got caught picking a flower and one of the managers walked by and said, \"Pretty aren't they?\" LOL I was sooo red! I was there with 3 others. We would have had plenty of space in the regular room I booked, but when we got there, we upgraded to the suite on the bay. It was only $50 more a night and well worth it. We had a huge living room, big deck with 2 chairs, table and every morning we could feed the ducks right off our balcony. The bedroom had 2 large queen beds and both rooms had vaulted ceilings. The beds were very comfortable and clean. The bathroom was HUGE with his and her sinks. The shower put out nice pressure as well. The best part of the suite is the room outside the bathroom. It had 2 large closets that were mirrored, a vanity table and chair in front of a wall mirror to do your makeup, hair, etc. That room had 2 doors so there was a good flow to the whole place. The kitchen was large and plenty of room to stay for a month if need be. Parking was $10 for the whole stay. That didn't bother me too much considering I was so happy about the place.

The second was the I arrived after they stopped with the concerts. That was more my fault for not researching more of when the concerts run, however, their restaurant has live music each night. The pros. When I first contacted the property the reservations line was very helpful and didn't make me feel stupid. When I first arrived in San Diego I called the hotel a few times asking about the shuttle service, they sent out a shuttle right away to pick me up. The first thing that I have problems when I travel by plane is I try to travel as light as possible and then I tend to forget things that I actually needed like my toothbrush. I noticed that late night so I went to the front desk and asked. Vanessa provided me with the toothbrush and even some toothpaste. Then later that night I had questions so I went back to the front desk and Jennifer helped me with a list of things to do, and directions, both of them were very helpful with all the questions I had. And they didn't make me feel stupid when I had dumb questions either. The hotel itself is being renovated. The room I was in was very nice. I had the standard small fridge and a microwave, an iron and ironing board, a coffee maker, an alarm clock and a hair dryer. My bathroom had a heat lamp in it which was very nice. The hotel has a nice pool that I believe is heated and a spa. It is located by a private marina and on the other side there is a boating site. The hotel is located close to the airport so you do hear airplane noise every now and then, but, it was not even close to a problem. The fitness room isn't huge, but, it does have weights, bike, treadmill, and a step machine. The latter 3 all have televisions and plugs for your ipod. The lobby has StarBucks coffee in the morning and if you want breakfast you can go to their restaurant.

The pictures on the hotel's website were accurate and the grounds are beautiful - the pool and jacuzzi clean and well maintained, a great experience for our first trip to San Diego. I got scared right before we left on the trip as I saw some bad reviews posted, but a call to the hotel asking about renovations led to my being told that they were renovating some rooms with new refrigerators and microwaves and they would make sure I had a room with no repairs needed or in progress. We arrived early and they stored our luggage and although they were very busy they did get us into our room an hour earlier than posted check in time. The staff was wonderful - very cheerful and helpful. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. We had a king room with pool/garden view and I asked to be placed where we'd have the least noise from the concerts (my husband's a light sleeper) and they got that taken care of.The concerts that played onsite while we were there did not negatively impact us as far as the noise or the parking. Our room was a ground floor (I recommend this as it had a walk out patio with chairs while the 2nd floor rooms above us had windows but no balcony and sitting on the patio enjoying the wonderful San Diego evenings was a pleasure I wouldn't have missed). One reviewer said you could enjoy the concerts if you chose to and when you closed the wiondow, it closed off the sound and I agree for the most part. Some performers may be louder than others but the concerts are over by 11 so not a big deal. We did get charged for a daily newpaper that I never knew I was going to be charged for and never received, but when I called the hotel a couple days after leaving and explained I did not get a paper, they took it right off the bill - a very minor annoyance in an otherwise great experience. The hotel also offers use of a PC in the lobby so I was able to check in the day before our return flight and print our boarding passes - another great amenity. I also enjoyed the surrounding harbor and pathways along the harbor that can be used for walking or biking. There is a gaggle of ducks that hang around the front of the building but I discovered that at night, they walk through the grounds and go in the back to their \"real\" home - very funny to watch the procession! Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone who is unsure about where to stay in this city.

Between my wife, son and friend they came up with enough cash to secure the rooms, forgoing dinner until I arrived. The clerk at the desk when I arrived knew nothing. The next morning I checked again and was told I owed $200.00 for the previous night. I paid in advance for that (Sat) night. That night when we returned ours doors wouldn't open> The front desk again said I owed for that night. I paid again, only to be told at check out I owed another $200.

We arrived on 11/14 and were given a standard poolview room with no extras. We went to the lobby to find out if there had been a mistake. When my husband went to the lobby and he asked about this, the manager said the package could not be booked through the 800 number but by the desk or the internet. We have the flyer and this is not true, you can book it through the 800 number. We don't know why he told us this. The hotel agent also said this package just wasn't available to us, were billed the same price as the package for a standard pool-view room. The manager came out and backed up hotel agent's statements. Furthermore, just by seeing the price and our previous stay, the staff should have known the $179.00 was for the package because rack rates for Humphrey's was $169.00.

The room was dingy and dirty and the toilet had a ring around the edges of God only knows what. There was NO champagne, no fruit, no basket and no breakfast the next morning.

To the hotel's credit (and since we were eager to check out so we could return to the Zoo), the hotel sent someone up from the front desk with a key to a room two doors down, so we could use the facilities before leaving. After I requested a reduction in the one-night rate, they took 25 percent off, and comped our lounge charge ($40) from the afternoon before.

Getting to hear Steve Tyrell rehearse for the concert was a nice experience. On the still more negative side: We made a reservation at the hotel restaurant for 8:45, when we were told they would have room since the pre-concert crowd had cleared out. We weren't seated until sometime after 9 (since there were only 3 other parties in the restaurant, which is fairly large, didn't quite understand this).

Also, be aware of the noise issues at this hotel because of the concert venue on the hotel grounds, and the number of large groups which reserve this venue. Full Review Humphreys Half Moon Inn is on Shelter Island, San Diego. The hotel is situated with a boat works, where yachts and other small boats are housed and maintained on one side, and a marina on the other. After the many positive reviews on this website I had high expectations, but my early impressions were disappointing. The website seems to indicate that your room will either be a marina/bay or a garden view. The hotel website includes a description of the non-Bay view rooms as follows: \u201cFirst floor rooms offer direct access to our private pool and tropical gardens through furnished patios.\u201d Unfortunately, it turned out that our rooms were what are labeled \u201ctraditional\u201d rooms by the hotel, which means they do not look out on the garden or the bay, but on to the parking lot. These rooms are not mentioned till you dig further into the website. Quite frankly, for the price the room I stayed in was not good value. The advertised price per night for the room was $189. Because of a concert being held on the property on the first night, the actual room rate was $209. Two subsequent nights were at a rate of $139, which was a rate negotiated for our group (posted rate was $189). The room d\u00e9cor was quite honestly upper-end motel quality (perhaps equivalent to a Best Western or La Quinta). My room was dark, and had a very musty smell to it, ironic in light of a sign in the room which said \u201cFresh\u201d and warned of a $250 charge for smoking in the room. There are some features of the rooms which bring up the quality. Gilchrist and Soames toiletries in the bathroom are nice, and the free wireless internet access is appreciated by those with laptops. There is also an in-room safe, a self-service coffee maker, and an ironing board and iron. Other room amenities include: laundry service, and room-service (see below for a review of the service). The rooms are air conditioned (welcome, even in the much-vaunted \u201cmild\u201d climate of San Diego), and the air conditioner in my room was quite and effective. Other rooms I looked at were more light and airy, and had more room; though the d\u00e9cor was similar. Higher rate rooms also have robes provided. Housekeeping The room was generally well cleaned, but on two nights I had to go to the front desk to ask for a form to hang on my front door to pre-order breakfast. There was a form provided to submit for laundry to be done, but no bag provided to put the laundry in. On a strange note, housekeeping would try to clean the room at 8:00 AM. If you order the breakfast from room service, then you\u2019ll need to put out the privacy sign after breakfast to avoid having housekeeping interrupt you after your breakfast! Other Amenities The hotel does offer a free shuttle service from the airport, and the service was very quick. The check-in staff was polite and efficient and professionally dealt with a set of packages which were delivered to the hotel prior to my arrival. The pool area and tropical grounds are nicely kept. Room Service On the night of arrival I attempted to order room service at 6:30 PM, but was warned that it would be at least an hour. I went and had a drink at the pool, and met friends and then re-tried to order at 8:30 PM, at which point the wait was a reasonable 25 minutes. Dinner (Filet Mignon + a Cr\u00e8me Brulee) was $56 (no alcohol). The service was prompt and courteous. I used room service for breakfast for two mornings, and found the breakfast to satisfactory, though the hotel did get my cooked egg order wrong on one morning. A nice touch was that room service calls you about five minutes before they are going to deliver the breakfast, so you can be awake and decent when they arrive! Noise Issues Do be aware that there are concerts (both public and private) held regularly on the hotel grounds, so definitely check the concert dates on the hotel website if you are not interested in hearing the music. However, private group using the concert area will not be shown on the website. Concerts also impact the availability of the fitness room and other facilities. The night I arrived there was a public concert taking place, and I could hear the music throughout the grounds, but did not hear it in my room (an advantage of being at far end of the property and facing the parking lot, away from the concert area). At the close of the concert there was a bit of noise in the parking lot from people talking, starting cars, returning to their rooms, etc. but not bad. Even on nights when a public concert is not advertised, the hotel may be hosting a private event, which includes a band or DJ using the concert area. The noise will impact the surrounding rooms, and some hotel facilities will not be available. From other posts I understand that this is also a popular venue for weddings, and wedding parties. If you decide to book a nicer room, say overlooking the Bay, you should enquire as to whether there are public or private concerts scheduled and/or wedding or other groups. You might try for a room in the K,L or M buildings to minimize the noise issues, and maximize your privacy. Overall Frankly, I would not recommend this hotel because of the noise issues with the concerts, and other large private parties which rent the facilities. If you are with a group, and are looking for a conference hotel, then this may be a good facility, but be sure to warn your attendees that the rooms do vary in quality. A different hotel, The Dana at Mission Point, is owned by the same owners and might be a better bet for people not traveling as a part of a group. We did a kayak tour from that hotel, and it seemed like a nicer facility. However, do read the reviews about that hotel on this website for information about the old buildings v. the new buildings. If you want to try this hotel, then it is probably worth spending the money to get a room which looks out over the bay. I would especially avoid the \u201ctraditional\u201d rooms, which are poor value. Even the \u201cgarden view rooms\u201d don\u2019t have much appeal (they\u2019re not very private). A bay view room, at the far end of the property from the concert area and the pool is probably your best bet, though these are likely the most expensive.", "Date": "September 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff Wales UK", "Title": "\u201cTropical Paradise on the Marina\u201d", "Author": "CaptinEO7", "ReviewID": "UR8694213", "Content": "After spending a long time researching the ideal place to stay for a week in San Diego & having spent time in the city before some time ago we finally settled on Humphreys & we were so glad we made that decision. We drove down after staying a few nights at the Disneyland Hotel and found the hotel relatively easily (it's only a 5 minute drive from the airport). The location is a pleasant 10/15 minute drive along the bay to Downtown, less to Sea World & slightly more to the Zoo (all of which you have to do whilst in the city). The city itself does look much further away when you look across the bay but don't let this deceive you, as long as you have a car it's lovely to be a very short drive away but feel like you're a million miles from the city. The hotel is situated a minute or two off the \"mainland\" by a narrow stretch of land literally the width of a road lined with a number of boating stores & nautical restaurants. The hotel itself consists of a variety of building styles, most of which surround the pool & garden area. The main entrance is an impressive,large Polynesian-style wooden arch, the the theme of which continues through the cool lobby and throughout the hotel. The public areas are all beautifully landscaped with a great pool & hot tub surrounded by lush foliage. To the one side of the hotel lies a superb view of the immediate marina-side although the suites that look out over this are substantially more expensive than throughout the rest of the property. Our room was a Garden-View style which opened up directly onto the pool area although one of the only negatives about the hotel was that the location of ours(and most of the rooms of this type) were set slightly below ground level and were subsequently very dark. We preferred this option however to a room which faced the entrance-side of the hotel which opened onto the parking-lot and did look like upmarket motel rooms from the exterior. Our room was very tastefully decorated with two large beds and a large bathroom with two wash-hand basins. Even though the room was dark until all the lamps were switched on we particularly liked the ceiling with natural wooden beams painted white. We never tried the restaurant which is apparently highly rated and did look very, very nice but the one thing we didn't utilise which we would have loved to was the Open-Air Concert Venue. When checking in you are given a timetable of events and throughout the Summer there were a whole host of artists including George Benson, Huey Lewis & The News, The Indigo Girls, Steve Winwood, Boyz 2 Men & Steve Winwood. We would have loved to have watched a concert whilst staying at the property but whilst we were there nobody was to our fancy. It must be THE coolest venue to watch a gig. To one side the tropical feel of the hotel, to the other the open marina and only steps from our room. Often we ate in a local restaurant and whilst walking back to the hotel we were walking past hundreds of people who were vacating the premises - it was very laid back however and just overall very cool. There are several restaurants & bars you can walk to from Humphreys & we particularly enjoyed Miguels (Mexican) & Fiddler's Green (casual bar & restaurant upstairs). Both establishments are 5/10 minute walk from the hotel & whilst they both offered vastly different experiences both places perfectly matched our needs of great food, beer & wine in relaxed but very unique atmospheres. Overall we absolutely loved our stay at Humphreys - we paid approx \u00a380 per night & for that we got a great location, beautifully kept grounds & pool & although slightly on the dark side, very nice rooms.

Not knowing much about Shelter Island, and having a picky husband, I really hoped our stay would be worth the $$. I reserved a Marina View Suite...and didn't regret the decision at all! As you see from photos, this hotel has a very tropical setting. The pool is surrounded by palms and lush plant life; parrots and koi fish add ambiance, and the casual setting make this a relaxing place. Gorgeous! The staff seem decent; not overly friendly, not overly helpful. Definitely pleasant and relaxed. Our room did indeed look over the Marina. We had two huge rooms and a full kitchen (no dishwasher). The room slept up to six people. A beautiful granite/marble bathroom. A triangular patio to enjoy the view. The recent updates the hotel made to these rooms makes it easy to overlook the old sofa bed, old kitchen cabinets, and mildew in one corner of the tub. The beds were very soft, comfortable. Air conditioning worked great (and we needed it!) and there was a fan too. Overall, great room. My picky husband was pleased! We were just two staircases over from Humphrey's concert hall and were pleased to listen to the Blues playing, while we sat on our patio. Concerts are usually over by 10 ish. The frequent entertainment is what makes the hotel unique. Friends of ours stayed in a guest room (room 105), and the patio was directly over the audience for the concert. What a fantastic spot to watch the concert from! IF YOU HAVE SMALL KIDS AND WANT THEM TO GO TO SLEEP EARLY, MAKE SURE YOUR ROOM IS ON THE OPPOSITE END OF THE PROPERTY. The staff will not warn you ahead of time unless you ask in advance! The guest room was beautiful too, by the way. The restaurant serves very good food and the Sunday brunch is fabulous...make a reservation! If you want to eat poolside, however, order well in advance...it takes forever to get the food. We even ordered some cocktails, poolside on Labor Day - the pool bar wasn't open yet and it took the restaurant bar over 30 minutes to bring four drinks. The pool temp was perfect, lounge chairs seemed new, towels ample. We even played croquet and we saw several people enjoying ping pong. Shelter Island is busy, but not overly. It's fairly convenient to the airport, Old Town, and Mission Bay. If you wish to avoid any windy conditions, the marina side of this hotel is great...while we were there, there was hardly any breeze!

We first stayed at the Loews Coronado and were honestly a bit skeptical when we first got to Humphrey's- and the mixed reviews on this site didn't help. However we were pleasantly surprised. The location of this resort is perfect- sorrounded by the bay on one side (actually across a small road), and the marina on the other. Absolutely no odor, bugs, or birds from the marina which was surprising. We stayed in a junior suite overlooking the concert area- at a rate of 279 per night booked on the hotel's website. Furnishings in the room are a bit dated and the lighting is not the greatest- though overall it was very clean and comfortable, though they haven't picked up on the newer hotels bedding method of no bedspread. Word of warning- the girl at the front desk told us that if you ask for a room overlooking the concerts you will definitely not get it. They do this to avoid anyone videotaping the concert or scalping the \"seats\" in your room. However when she heard we were on our honeymoon we lucked out and got to enjoy two great concerts from our \"skybox\" balcony at no charge! The entire resort ROCKS the night of a concert so if you're looking for quiet then steer clear on concert nights. The pool is spacious and large- pool bar is open throughout the evening. Humphrey's has a LOT of kids running around and they tend to occupy the pool during peak hours. We enjoyed it most in the morning. An \"adult\" pool would be a great benefit here. There is a small but comfortable jaccuzi. The grounds of the hotel are very well landscaped with a tropical palm tree/waterfall feel to it. Slight drawback are the 2 parrots the hotel puts out in one of the gardens every morning- they shreak and scream at each other loud enough to wake you up. It's entertaing at first but after a while its plain annoying. There are also a lot of ducks wandering around- a few found there way into the pool which is fun to watch but not entirely appealing from a sanitary point of view. The pool itself was for the most part clean but looked like it could have been skimmed and chlorinated a little bit better. The hotel's restaurant is top notch- though the interior looks like it could use a refresh of decor, however the food was excellent- just be warned its a fine dining establishment- our tab was 100.00 for 2 with drinks and tip. The bar/lounge is a popular live act spot as well, however there was a cover so we didn't go in. We ordered room service during one of the concerts which was reasonably priced (just remember its room service so you're paying for the convenience). Room service will also deliver to the pool area where they have patio tables and chairs set up to eat at. Parking at the hotel was ample (8.00 per day). Compared the Loews with its massive property and parking garages Humphrey's was a breeze to check in and out of. All in all I can wholeheartedly reccommend this hote. As long as you have an open mind and deal with a few little quirks you'll find Humphrey's to be much more of an experience then paying 100.00 more per night at some of the more \"upscale\" properties.", "Date": "July 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newbury Park, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at Humphrey's Half Moon Inn & Suites\u201d", "Author": "holidaysrule", "ReviewID": "UR8235115", "Content": "We checked into the hotel and was pleasantly surprised with our room.

It also seemed extremely odd to me that they would have a family style suite but not one single kids item on their room service menu. Kind of wierd! This hotel is not at all close to SeaWorld, so be advised you'll need to take a cab.

There was a concert taking place on our first night of three, but this didn't bother us at all. In fact it adds a nice feel to the evening. There is one BIG health and hygiene issue that the property should take urgent action on. That is the resident duck population that treat the pool and pool area as their personal toilet. I'm not kidding here folks, excrement was floating in the pool and around the steps in and out. A bit scary when travelling with young children and the international spectre of H5N1 bird flu. That aside, the pool area was nice and relaxing, the bar service fine with a good choice of cocktails. I would recommend taking the 10 minute trip into the Old Town and dining at the Old Town Mexican Cafe. A great experience, with good quality Mexican food at great prices. Another recommended option just a 10 min walk from the hotel is Miguels Cocina - great option if eating with kids, the staff there were great and so were the Margaritas :) We enjoyed our stay in the San Diego area, as we did our overall journey down the pacific coastal highway.

What a disappointment! Before reading this please note that I don't have excessive expectations about hotels and have never written a negative review before but this was my experience. When we first arrived we thought it looked nice enough with flamed torches lighting up the entrance to the hotel which was in a nice quiet part of San Diego. The pleasantries ended there! I asked the receptionist if she would give us a room which didn't overlook the carpark (as I had read in previous reviews). She audiably sighed and reluctantly gave us an \"upgrade\" to a room by the pool. No one offered to help us with our luggage. We made our way to our poolside room (#127) and were in for a shock! Firstly, there was no light by the door so we had to stumble around looking for a light switch in the dark. The air conditioning was on full blast and it was freezing cold. We found that there were no ceiling lights, just lamps. The room stank, was dirty and damp. To top it all off our \"upgrade\" was a view of the pool toilets bang outside our room, no view of the pool at all and very dark. Not pleasant. The room was of motel standard, nothing nice to say about it at all. The old sheets were limp from damp, everything was so worn and dirty. The showerhead was brown with dirt, there were cobwebs in the bathroom and the dirty carpet was damp when walked on with bare feet. I felt conned and incredibly disappointed, it was a long way from the luxurious pictures they advertised. I returned to the reception and asked if there was any other room at all available, but was told by the very rude receptionist that there wasn't (which I later found out wasn't the case at all) and that we couldn't have a refund as we had booked through British Airways. As I had a small child with me I decided to just put up with it for one night but the next morning I headed down to reception again to see what could be done and was greeted by a different receptionist (Danielle) who was so much more helpful. She showed me another room on the upper floor which was better, although still dirty and old. Then a junior suite (#100) which was much better. It was fresh smelling, airy, not damp, clean and there was a king size bed, pull out sofa bed, two TVs, sink, microwave and fridge. It was still old looking though but much better than the previous rooms we had seen. The balcony overlooked the parking lot and over to the bay of San Diego. We decided to go for the suite as we were unable to leave the hotel and could not possibly stay in the room we were given - the smell was so bad. Danielle kindly said that we would not have to pay the extra $60 per night or the suite due to the situation. The heated pool was nice, but so crowded we couldn't get a sunbed. I can't say it was relaxing either as there were some drunk people being loud by the pool which was off putting when you have children and the bands practicing sound checks all afternoon before their concerts ,were right next door. The view of the stage and harbour was stunning. There is a useful laundry room too. Adjacent to the hotel (but not part of it) there is a little beach from which we saw pelicans and a sealion. You cannot swim in the sea here as it is declared as unsafe due to contamination, but it is a nice little spot none the less. There were a few concerts and events at the hotel during our stay, which disrupted parking, was noisy for putting children to sleep, meant you couldn't use the laundry, had to walk round the outside of the hotel to get to the pool and they put the guest toilets to the side of our balcony! It was also difficult to get a restaurant reservation. In the mornings they emptied the toilets whilst we were sitting outside having coffee and the smell was unbearable. We decided to check out two nights early and just accept that we had made a mistake with this hotel, lose the \u00a3200 we had paid for those two nights and pay to stay somewhere better.

As much as I agree with a lot of the opinions about this hotel, I would still have to rate my experience at Humphrey's as bad (I don't see myself as being a difficult person but you be the judge). I booked the room through the hotels website months in advance. We arrived on a Tuesday night (week before Mem. Day weekend) and recieved a room which basically overlooked the parking lot and a marina across the street. I asked if they had something upstairs or a different building (you'll see why later)and they said they were booked but they would get back with us later. Basically, by the time they got back to us the next day we felt we just wanted to stay in the room we were in because we had already unpacked (4 people for 5 days = a lot of clothes!). The room was very nice (Jr. Deluxe Suite) and very clean...great cleaning people! Everything was fine until the first night of concerts (Thurs. night). I was aware that they held concerts there but when you look at the website pics it seems as though the concerts are held away from the rooms...not the case! The stage and concert were held right behind our building! This wasn't even bad...I figured it would end at 11pm. Thursday and Friday night went by and it was a bit annoying but I wasn't going to let it ruin my vacation. After all we were the ones that decided to stay in that particular room. They had offered us a room on the second floor but in the same building - so it wouldn't have made much of a difference. (HINT: If someone from Humphrey's is reading this..if a guest stays in these buildings during three nights of concerts, it would probably be a good idea to at least comp. them free tickets to at least one of the three events - you would recieve less complaints - kind of a \"if you can't beat them, join them\" philosophy) Well by Saturday night we decided to stay away for the majority of the concert and come back late in the evening to avoid the mess. We got back at 10:30pm (concert started at 7pm). The concert was still going on but we expected it to wrap up soon based on past experience. Here is how the rest of our night went: 11:00pm - concert wrapped up 12:00am - Drunk people out in the hallway yelling. 12:30am - Drunk people still yelling - called front desk. Security came and people left. 1:00am - Wake up to hear the sound off dripping water - our sink was mysteriously overflowing with water (we did not have the water on!) It was overflowing onto the carpet - called front desk. Maintenence guy came and fixed problem. 1:30am - Drunk people back again. 2:30am - Drunk people back again. We were told that these people were part of the band from the concert. The next mornign we complained to the front desk and after some discussion they eventually comp'd us our room rate for our last night stay. This is a very nice hotel and I would have enjoyed it if it weren't for the building (concerts) we were in. I felt for the amount we paid (250/night) we shouldn't have to put up with it if we weren't there to see the concert(s).

Shelter Island is off the beaten path, pleasantly quiet with beautiful views of downtown and the harbor, but close to everything. We loved the tropically landscaped grounds and pool, the large comfortable room, the service and the restaurant. We walked to the Bali Hai restaurant across the roundabout for a fabulous dinner with a view one night, and drove to Miguel's at nearby Scott Street another. It was lovely not to have to drive far at night for dinner, after touring all day. We love to walk, and so enjoyed exploring Old Town, Little Italy, the Gaslamp district, University Heights, and of course, the zoo and Balboa Park. We loved the public park, music and outdoor cafes on Coronado Island, with beautiful views back toward town. We also drove over to see the Del, which was charming, but the traffic was bumper to bumper all the way. And the restaurant menu was disappointing -right on the water and no fresh seafood, so we didn't stay. We also enjoyed walking around La Jolla, having lunch in a sidewalk cafe, and were enchanted by the seals and pups at the cove. The museum of modern art, which is there, was also nice, and we drove up the winding roads in the hills to see the houses and views.

We had a nice suite overlooking the marina and the stage (no acts performed while we were there)--many rooms have their own balconies/patios. The room was spacious, clean, quiet, and comfortable. The hotel staff all went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Ate at the hotel's restaurant several times and found the food and prices to be fine. Be sure to ask for a room overlooking the marina, otherwise you'll have a room overlooking the parking lot which lies between the hotel, the park across the street (with its large parking lot) and the harbor. The views from the marina rooms are really nice--an endless array of boats with the hills of La Playa as a backdrop--hopefully you'll see some of the same beautiful sunsets that we did. The landscaped grounds reminded me of stays in more tropical locations with lots of jungle-like plants and meandering paths. It has a nice size pool and hot tub which are easily accesible from from all rooms. Lots of places to read and lounge in the pool area. Also saw a small putting green on the grounds and an outdoor table tennis table which seemed to get quite a bit of use. Across the street from the hotel is a nice walking path that winds along a park next to the water. A short walk from the hotel are several restaurants, and cafes, including an excellent Mexican restaurant that is very popular. You'll need a car at this hotel--San Diego is a suburban city and the sites are miles apart, so plan on renting a car anyway. I'd say it would be difficult and time consuming to visit this city and rely exclusively on public transportation. The hotel is centrally located for tourists and is only about 5-10 minutes from the airport, about 10-15 minutes from downtown (be sure to go to the gas light district at night to have dinner), about 20 minutes from Pacific Beach (a big beach scene), and about 25 min from La Jolla.

Two people at the desk, both ignored me for probably 1-2 minutes (doesn't sound like a long time, but when you're the ONLY one in the lobby, it was rather odd).

Never could figure out why the terse treatment at the front desk, because the rest of the service was great throughout the week. I do have one quick story.....eating lunch in the restaurant (very good food by the way). The waiter (female) came to give us the check, one person in my party said they only had a $20, so if the waiter could break it (read here...a tip would be coming), the waiter said, \"I don't have change\" (somewhat snotty). She left, brought back the others at our table credit card receipts and brought the other person's $20 bill back. We just laughed....so much for her tip!

Our room was a suite which had a separate living room and it was very spacious. The cost was a little higher than other hotels but the size of the room was well worth it. We were also upgraded to a bay view room on the second floor with a great view of the bay from the balcony. Although it was close to the airport, we never heard the planes in the room, only on the balcony. The overall appearance and cleanliness of the hotel was fantastic. The grounds are remarkable, with huge tropical plants and lots of flowers. Although we didn't swim in the pool it looked clear and inviting. The service is the best feature at Humphrey's! Everyone was fantastically helpful and friendly, from the desk clerks to the shuttle driver. For example, my daughter and friend wanted to rent a car for the day to go to Mexico. The concierge made arrangements and the shuttle drove them to the car rental office. When they discovered they couldn't rent with a check card, the hotel shuttle driver took them to the train station and helped them with schedules. The concierge also printed our boarding passes when I couldn't get the printer in the lobby to work, and called a taxi for my son and his friend. The concert venue was great, although I heard one family whose balcony faced the stage say that it felt like the concert was in their room. We took our chairs to the landing and watched for free. Some of the hotel staff told us we could also watch by the pool area and they were serving snacks and drinks to hotel guests. We were asked to show our room keys but the staff was very friendly. The concerts always end at 10:30 PM, but if you have small children or have an early morning, get a room away from the amphitheater. The location was scenic, with great jogging trails and a park on the bay across the street. There was a sailboat regatta one day that we watched from our balcony, and lots of military and other ship traffic. The hotel also provides bicycles, free for the first hour with a fee applying after that. We did not have an automobile so we didn't have to deal with parking. We ate at the hotel restaurant twice and had room service twice. We all thought it was great food. It was somewhat pricey, but the quality and menu variety were very good. There are not very many other restaurants near, although if you can walk several blocks you can find several.

We arrived early and our room was ready. The gentleman at the front desk was very friendly and professional, as was every staff member we ran into. We had a bay view room which wasn't exactly on the bay. There was a parking lot, street, and a grassy parkway between the hotel and the bay, but we just put chairs up by the window and when we sat down we could only see the bay which was nice. We walked down the path to the end of the island and when we returned to the room there was a HUGE basket of fruit and king-sized candy bars plus a bottle of nice champagne. You get to keep the glasses as part of the package. It was very relaxing sitting at the window snacking on fruit and drinking the champagne and watching all the boats sail by on the bay. The room was very well appointed and nicely decorated. The bathroom was beautiful with granite counter tops and around the tub. The room was spotless and well-insulated from noise. The only complaint about the room was that it was the size of a postage stamp. There was barely room to put the chairs between the bed and the window, and maybe 18 inches of space between the other side of the bed (king) and the wall. It did have high sloped ceilings which helped. There was a concert the night of our stay and even though we didn't have tickets, we were able to sit on a small balcony and listen. The pool area was very nice, and the rest of the grounds were wonderful and full of tropical landscaping. We checked out the rooms on the marina side which I thought had a much nicer view because they were right on the marina with a nice balcony or a patio and a little grassy area (no parking lot), but my husband thought our bay room view was better because the ships and boats were moving in the water, rather than tied up to berths. I guess it just depends on what you're looking for. In the morning we recieved breakfast in bed and the food was presented nicely and the room service was actually 5 minutes early. The food was good, not exactly outstanding, but room service food never is.

There are lots of good looking restaurants around, but we didn't get to try any. The Hotel is in a Polynesian theme with alot of lush vegetation on the grounds. We had a ground floor room facing the inner courtyard, near the pool. We were also near the fish pond and the parrots (which my young kids loved). There were also several families of ducks wandering around the grounds, which the kids loved feeding.

Then again, we're British, so walking a couple of hundred yards (as we had to do on a single occasion) to our room wasn't a problem. Do Americans walk ANYWHERE. I must mention the restaurant which has one of the best views in San Diego. We had dinner one night which was good (great scallops) if a little pretentious. But the meal to go for here is breakfast. Sit by a huge picture window overlooking the marina and enjoy a great selection of breakfast goodies at very reasonable prices. I can recommend the corned beef hash with poached egg (to die for).

The day we arrived we got the impression it was a couples resort, everything silent with the odd couple lounging in the sun. However, it wasn't always like that. The hotel hosts weddings and on one of the days the guests were enjoying the pool for a few hours before the service. The pool was packed, lots of drinking,laughing, joking, and American football being played in the pool. We didn't have a problem with this at all. It was a good atmosphere.

We decided to endure it overnight and when we informed the hotel reception the next morning they were very helpful and apologetic and got a maintenance guy to fix it while we went out for the day. For the rest of our stay we had no other problems, the only other gripe was that the noise from rooms above us was audible and when the room directly above us used their water the pipes were quite noisy. This didnt bother us too much as we were out almost all day every day and from morning to late night. We also didnt hear much aircraft noise considering the nearness to the airport. The grounds of the hotel are of a high standard and the pool area is very lush and green. We ate at the hotel restaurant each morning for breakfast which provides a great view over shelter island marina. The food was great and reasonably priced and the service was almost always excellent. The location of the hotel on shelter island gives you some great views across the bay to San Diego and Coronado naval base.

We had to schlep our bags at check-in and check-out. There's a desk in the front lobby labeled \"bell desk\" but I never saw anyone at it. It just had brochures on top. The place has beautiful grounds and I enjoyed the pool very much. The bed was comfortable. The bay location is very nice. These complaints (aside from the room service) are not huge gripes, but they add up. If I were paying $100 a night I wouldn't care, but at $200 a night per room I think Humphreys needs to get on board with their service, and should certainly be offering bell service for those prices.

We were upgraded to a jr. suite for $199 + taxes -- I have an IATA # (if you're a travel agent you know what this is) so don't ask for this rate and expect to get it. We stayed in Building B on the ground floor; this building is next to the concert area, so be forewarned that in the summer you probably will hear the concert if you're in this building -- but they're over by 10:30 p.m. Since we drove down from L.A. in the evening and didn't check in until 11 p.m. or so after the concert let out, I had to explain to 2 parking lot attendants that I was a guest checking in and thus I was allowed park near the building our room was in (you're given a lot pass for your windshield upon checkin; I never had a problem finding a space near our room). My wife and I found the suite layout a bit strange: the bed is near the door in one half, a TV and bar area separates the bedroom from the living room that opens onto a porch area with view of the concert site. We would have preferred to have it the other way around with the bed away from the hallway door, but we got used to it by second night. We checked out the Humphrey's by the Bay lounge/bar and were pleasantly suprised that we didn't have to pay cover since we were staying at the hotel. The crowd verged on the older side, say 40+; my wife and I are late 20s/early 30s. We still had a good time. The management knows when to cut patrons off that are wasted (I have a short fuse when it comes to dealing with drunks bumping in to me). The dance floor was crowded and made for good people watching. We ate breakfast at the on-site restaraunt the next mornig: ~$50 for 2 including tip. Service was friendly, food prep was a little drawn out. But the view of the marina really made up for it. Very relaxing. Pool area is very nice and resort like; extra pool towels are provided; didn't try the bar, but it looked pretty good! Enjoyed this area a lot. Don't plan to get many laps in here unless you go early right when it opens -- there were quite a few families here in the afternoon. Humphrey's location is excellent for going out in downtown San Deigo if you drove yourself in or have a rental car: you can be in the gaslamp district or Balboa Park in 10 minutes. We really liked this convenience. There's a computer with hispeed internet access provided for free in the lobby. Nice for looking up directions or checking email. There's apparently wifi in the rooms, but I didn't try this out, so I don't know if it's free or not. Negatives: the staff doesn't check the common hallway doors at night to make sure they're shut. This is obviously a security concern because if these doors remain open, anyone off the street can walk into the building. Secondly, we were awoken by the LOUD ICE MACHINE going at 7 a.m. our first morning! Had the doors been shut, we wouldn't have probably heard it. I complained about this when I checked out. If you're a light sleeper, you may not like the proximity to the San Deigo Airport -- once in a while -- but not often -- you can hear a plane taking off across the water. I can't speak to the paper-thin walls comments, but I did hear water pipes going once in a while as well as our neighbors the second morning moving their bags out. Would I stay here again? If I can get the special rate again for the jr. suite, sure.

Although the performing acts weren't artists we would usually pay to watch, it was still great to be able to watch it from our balcony for free!!! The rooms themselves are very nice. Everything looked new. Beds were extremely comfortable. As for other hotel facilities....the pool and hot tub were excellent. The poolside bar was nice for evening drinks. The view from marina/bay facing rooms is superb. The putting green and crocquet lawn weren't used by us, but a nice touch nonetheless.

I highly recommend Humphrey's and will be staying there again.", "Date": "April 13, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1774881", "Content": "We made a reservation through Hotels.com.
