Everything was super clean, the bathroom and kitchenette were small but it gave us the sense of what it is like to live in the city.

There were plenty of places to put all our bags. So the room was excellent, especially for the money. The staff was also excellent, extremely friendly and helpful.

The concierge was friendly and helpful about getting around New York. There was not much of a lobby, but we didn't need one, and the clientele seemed a good mix of families, teens, students, and other visitors to the city. We used their parking garage for our car; there might have been cheaper options nearby, but this was extremely convenient as it coordinated with the bellman. Finally, the location - perfect, a nice area, we walked everywhere, to the United Nations, back from the Empire State Building late at night, to Grand Central Station, it was not much walking at all (you have to expect this in the city). There were restaurants and shops nearby, although we didn't use any of them. Oh, and the website booking form was really good.

There was a queen sized bed with a table, a nightstand with an alarm clock, a TV on a stand in the corner, a seperate chair and a dresser. I guess the large size of the room made it seem a little empty. This is probably a good thing if you have a lot of belongings with you and you need to spread out. I checked in around 1:30 am after a long day at work. The hotel clerk was very pleasant as was the doorman. I had forgotten a razor and shaving cream and was provided with both after asking if any was available. I was also offered ther toiletries which I declined. The bed was comfortable and everything looked to be clean. The room was a bit warm even though the heat was set low. Again, this was probably good given the outside air was below freezing. With the AAA discount I paid $85 before taxes and $103 after they were added in. Thie is excellent for a New York hotel with large rooms. The location is pretty good. The UN and Grand Central terminal are about 5 minute walks in opposite directions. Grand Central offers entry into many subway lines and you can get anywhere fairly quickly.

There are a couple of diners, restaurants and fast food /great NY slice/bagel places nearby, all very short walking distance. Not to mention Grand Central's dining concourse.

There is a great little kitchen and a lot of room for NYC standards. It's unfortunate internet isn't free, but it's not too badly priced - $45 or so for the week we stayed.

It does come at a price though. Housekeeping was excellent. The rooms were so clean. I guess the table was a bit chipped on the side but honestly, I don't care.

Because I had trouble with accessing it a few times, the cost was totally refunded to me, which was not necessary but much appreciated. The area is a quieter one for NYC, but close to bus routes and not too far to the subway. NYC is a city for walking anyway, so we were happy with where the hotel was located.

We (husband and I and our two kids, aged 9 and 10) stayed at the Eastgate Towers in September this year. We would definitely stay again. What we loved - heaps of space in the apartment. There was a separate bedroom with two queen beds (the kids shared a bed, or invariably, one slept with me and one with my husband - we don't mind on holidays). It was great after a busy day as the kids could head to bed and we could sit in the lounge room, have a chat and a drink, watch tv etc. It was also great that in the morning, whoever woke early could sit in the lounge area whilst the others slept in in the bedroom. It was also great having two bathrooms. There is a laundry onsite downstairs. This was excellent - saved us carting the dirty clothes to a laundromat offsite or having to pay huge drycleaning bills. Having a kitchen and dining table was also great. We didn't cook any meals but was lovely to be able to spread out, bring back salads etc and sit up at the table. It is an easy 10 min walk (with kids) to Grand Central station and about 15 mins to Times Square. There are also a number of nice delis nearby for salads, fruit etc etc. The bathrooms are a little dated but definitely clean. If you are after the latest bathroom, then this place is not for you but really they are only about 5-10 years old and clean so to us that's all that mattered. The only couple of negatives and these are very little - there could have been a bit more crockery in the cupboards - bit lacking on plates, cups etc but maybe someone had taken some. Also the cost of the internet is quite expensive - we didn't have our own laptop etc so if you have, then it's free wifi.

The maid service was excellent (they even did our dishes and pots and pans every day). While other reviewers are correct in stating that the rooms could use updating, the accommodations are by no means shabby or uncomfortable. As a well-travelled reviewer, I can honestly state that this is an excellent option for those on a budget.

I spent a whole day trying to find a hotel in a good location that would accommodate the 5 of us. If you are traveling with only 2 children you have many options. If you have more than 2 children you can't fit into most of the decent hotels in NYC unless you pay for 2 rooms. On advice from fellow trip advisor users I found the Eastgate Towers. We paid about $200 a night with our AAA card for a 2 queen bed junior suite that also had a small kitchen and pull out sofa. The $200 doesn't account for the almost 15% tax. BE AWARE: When I made the reservation in January I was sure to clarify that I needed a room with the 2 queen beds. Then a few days before arriving called again to make sure my reservation said 2 queen beds. No one ever told me that the 2 bed suites were based on availability. So upon arrival I was very disappointed to find out that they didn't have any 2 bed suites available. The same thing happened to my sister-in-law who was traveling with a party of 6, 2 adults and 4 children. I met another woman in the lobby with 3 children who it also happened to. The hotel tried to make it right by giving us 2 roll-aways for free (normally $30 a night). There was plenty of room in the hotel for the 2 roll-aways. Problem was they were very uncomfortable, the pull out sofa is bad too. We had already been on the east coast for 6 nights and were exhausted, so was really disappointed that my kids weren't getting a comfortable night sleep. Having one bed in a room for 5-6 people isn't acceptable. That being said, the hotel was in a GREAT location, was clean, and the staff was friendly. It was great having a kitchen and saved us tons of money by making breakfast in the room and some lunches. There is a small grocery store a block away. The rooms are large. Seems to me they used to be apartments. Ours had 3 closets in it and a table that was big enough for all 5 of us to eat at. If you're picky about decor be warned that is very outdated. Halls can also be loud. You can hear people coming and going all hours.

After a tiring day out we came back to the hotel to wait for our new room cards when the receptionist told us no rooms were available. I couldn't believe it would be another second day when we would be living out of our suitcases and she said she would reserve us another room the next day however I was not going to wait again until a room became available. The receptionist told us we needed to speak to the manager to rectify the problem but I said we shouldn't have to repeat myself when we should of gotten what we paid for. We asked for a part refund but they could not do that but promised us a family room with two separate bedrooms. At this point I didn't know what to believe and again we did not unpack. When arriving back to the hotel on the third day of our week holiday, we were finally giving an upgrade. The room was more than we expected and after all the hassle we felt the hotel had compensated us. The room was massive with a separate kitchen, dining room with living room. Two bathrooms (one blocked but got fixed after we mentioned it) and two bedrooms, one with a double king size bed, and the other with two double beds. It was cleaned on a daily basis but the carpets were a bit dusty. Not sure if I will book again as I am not sure if I would of complained so much if they would of given us the upgrade.

What can I say about this hotel, apart from the fact that it was wonderful and far far better than I expected and believe me when I say I have extremely high standards! We had a suite on 23rd floor and the amount of space was unbelievable! We had a big king room and a large twin with 2 double beds. And oh my goodness are they the comfiest hotel beds I\u2019ve ever slept on! There were 2 wardrobes in each room and a further 2 storage cupboards in the living room. The dining table was great for eating and for spreading out our stuff to plan each day and there was ample space if we did want to have the full 6 people in the room. The full kitchen (which had everything you would need) could have been used for full meals but we just used it for snacks and the large fridge for keeping drinks cool and snacks which we got at the shops 2 minutes from the hotel. I did request a kettle on our 1st day and we had it within 5 minutes. The bathrooms were small but again had plenty of cupboards, ample towels and the shower was always hot and powerful. The hairdryer was also surprisingly powerful! The room was spotless and cleaned every day by house-keeping who also kept topping up our coffee supplies which we were grateful for! Some mention the d\u00e9cor is old fashioned, but it\u2019s not really. It gives a much more homey feel to the hotel and I much prefer that than somewhere that is contemporary and all white tiles. We had 3 lights in our room, so when we wanted lots of light we had it. The curtains don\u2019t close properly though, so if you can\u2019t sleep when the sunshine comes in, make sure you take an eye mask with you! I usually sleep with one anyway so it didn\u2019t matter to me. The corridors are a bit dark as they are papered a dark blue, but you don\u2019t stay in the corridors, so don\u2019t let this put you off. Also there are only 2 lifts, but they are really fast so we were never waiting more than seconds. A big plus was that we could open all of the windows to let fresh air in and to keep the room cool during the day. To shut out the noise outside at night, we put the air con on. I saw some weren\u2019t sure how to work the air con, but the controls are under a flap on the top of the unit. The lobby was small, compact and clean and had a computer (which I didn\u2019t use), sofas and a unit filled with tourist leaflets. All you need! Location wise was also great! The hotel is approx 7 minutes walk to Grand Central, the same to Bryant Park, 15 minutes from Rockefeller Plaza and 20 mins to Times Square! We had no problems flagging taxis right outside the hotel apart from on a Friday night but we got one by the time we walked 2 blocks. There was a great diner 3 blocks away when you turn left out of the hotel called Scotties which I can highly recommend and countless other diners and deli\u2019s just a 1 \u2013 3 minute walk away. There is also a Starbucks and a Pret a Manger beside Scotties and a McDonalds at the bottom of the block from the hotel to the right, so plenty of places to get free Wifi if you don\u2019t want to pay for it at the hotel, which is what I did as I didn\u2019t need it constantly. For the smokers or those that just want to sit outside, there is a little garden patio area at the side of the hotel which we loved just to relax in at the end of a days shopping. The staff were also superb. Unfortunately I was quite ill on the day of check-out, but they let me stay in the room for an extra half an hour so I didn\u2019t have to rush to check-out, which helped so much. Patrick was also superb! He stored all of our bags for us (and there were many) and he also booked a transfer to the airport for us (only took 25 minutes). We felt very well taken care of. This is the 2nd time I\u2019ve stayed in a hotel in New York and I can safely say that this was the bargain of the century and one of the best hotels I\u2019ve ever stayed in.

First off, our junior suite was an OK size, it looked like a former apartment with a cramped full kitchen and tiny bath, plus a small living room that unfortunately wasn't separated from the bedroom. Despite its size though, the entire place felt dated (think \"1970s chic\" without the chic) and thus not at all comfortable. I thought it would be a place my family could hang out and relax in between sightseeing but we couldn't be out of there long enough. The carpet constantly felt dirty and there was still food in the dish strainer when we checked in. Some of the glasses felt greasy upon first use. The trash can lid in the kitchen was broken and the TV was the old-style big-box model type that wasn't very sensitive to the remote control. We woke up with bites after our first night but I checked for bedbugs and didn't find any and my husband guessed that perhaps there were dust mites instead as parts of the room did feel rather dusty and caused his allergies to act up. As for the location, I didn't find it convenient at all, and I love to walk. The closest subway is Grand Central, which is great for food but the lines that run through there weren't main ones so we almost always had to transfer anyway. Plus, I thought that being out of Times Square would mean a quieter room but I guess because the building is so old and the walls are so thin, you can hear everything, such as the ambulances wailing by and cars honking below. I could even hear our neighbors' running water or when people were talking outside in the hallway. Speaking of the hallway, it always reeked of smoke, even though the building is supposed to be nonsmoking. Even the elevator smelled like smoke sometimes too. I guess you get what you pay for though because the price isn't too bad considering its size and that, after everything, is a hotel room in New York. Still, I think we could pay a similar price for a nicer, albeit smaller, more conveniently located room elsewhere. One other thing I should mention is the staff. While the housekeeping staff was quite friendly and always greeted us, the front desk staff could've cared less when we were standing right in front of them and the doormen/bellmen always looked like they'd rather be anywhere else but helping customers. It was as if we were an inconvenience to them for staying there. I also thought it was odd that although checkin is at 3, we arrived at 215 and were told our room wasn't ready yet. Now I know we were early, but it was less than an hour before checkin. We've arrived at other hotels as early as 6 a.m. and have been shown to our room right away; this was one of the rare times we were unable to check in early and although I know it's never a given, just the fact that it was so close to checkin time anyway but were denied makes me wonder. All in all, next time, I'd stay elsewhere. The good thing was that since we were out so much, we saw everything on our itinerary, plus more, so I guess that's something, right?", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albuquerque, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location & Value\u201d", "Author": "JulianneNM", "ReviewID": "UR109510663", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel in May for a 5-day mother-daughter vacation with my Mom and we had a great experience.

Eastgate is a hotel in the Affinia group, located in Murray Hill, and offers apartment style accomodations \u2013 actually extremely large suites!!!! I booked the suite on the Eastgate website after reading about a \u201cspecial deal\u201d on 2 bedroom suites in a thread in the NYC forum. I love the forums!!!! Arrival - We arrived by Dial 7 car service from EWR around 11:30 a.m. to store our lugguge until check-in at 3:00. When we dropped off our luggage at the hotel to be stored, the desk clerk advised that our room may be ready before 3:00 and gave me her card to call back and check. I verified that we were getting a two bedroom, two bath suite and asked what floor our room was on and was told the 8th floor. She advised that she could check us in now, so that when we return, we could just stop at the desk and pick up the room keys. With that said and done, we hit the streets. Lobby - The lobby is very small, with two desk counters, a sofa set, coffee table, TV, and short wall loaded with tourist brochures. The two elevators are \u201cright there\u201d in the lobby as well \u2013 all in a small compact area that was crowded just a few times when we were passing through. There is no restaurant in this hotel. There was an ATM when you first entered the lobby, but I never really looked at it or used it. The desk staff and bellmen were always very courteous and polite. No issues there. Just like clockwork, when we returned about 6:00 p.m., we stopped and picked up the room keys, only to find out that we were on the 15th floor instead of the 8th floor. The desk clerk handed me an Eastgate Tower envelope with my name on it, and when I opened it, I had a wonderful surprise \u2013 we bagged a BAG (Big Apple Greeter)! Our BAG had sent a fax to my attention at the hotel to advise me of our meeting time for our personal tour! See my trip report. It's a work in progress at the moment, so stay tuned for info about about BAG experience. http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k4447113-Trip_report_Biting_the_Big_Apple_with_the_Boys-New_York_City_New_York.html The bellman retrieved our luggage from storage and we summoned the elevator. The elevators are small, but during our 5 day stay, we never waited too long for one. Several times, however, they were too full for us to get in, so we had to wait for another one. There was also another elevator around the side to the right, but we never took that one. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s for guests or not. The suite \u2013 Upon exiting the elevator, the hallway is very short. There were only seven suites on our floor. I\u2019m not sure if every floor was like that or not. Our suite was 15G, very roomy, and very clean. The rooms were quiet. We never heard a peep from any other rooms or from outside while we were there. The suite looked just like the pictures posted on the various travel websites and in travellers\u2019 reviews. It was kinda stuffy when we first arrived probably because there was no air circulating. We sprayed some \u201csmell good\u201d room spray and the musty smell went away. The furniture is dated (which we already knew), but we were hardly in the room anyway, and just wanted a comfortable, roomy place to lay our heads. And the beds were VERY comfortable!!!! I had two pillows on my side of the bed \u2013 one was soft and one was hard. It was good to have a choice or to use both if you preferred. My girlfriend and I stayed in the bedroom with the one queen/king size bed. The boys stayed in the bedroom with the two queen beds. The sofa in the living area also had a queen sleeper, that my nephew slept on for three of our four nights, leaving one empty bed in the boys\u2019 bedroom. There were three TVs \u2013 one in each bedroom, and one in the living area. There was plenty of closet space, drawer space, and floor space. We were not bumping into each other with every step or turn \u2013 it was very spacious! Decent dining table and four chairs in the living area. The bathrooms were identical in size and layout, small, with very little counter space, but manageable. We kept most of our toiletries on the bedroom dresser. No big deal there. The hot water in our bathroom was plentiful. I never asked the boys about their water temperature, so it must have been fine. The first day, we did not have any washcloths in our bathroom, but there were two on the second day. Plenty of hand towels and bath towels though! I\u2019m not sure what the boys had in their bathroom. I never went in there. Mainly because I don\u2019t know if they lifted the lids when they peed.... Eeeewwww! On our last night, the toilet in our bathroom wouldn\u2019t flush and you could hear the water constantly running. We had gotten in late once again, so I didn\u2019t call since we did not want to be disturbed and just wanted to get some sleep. We were going to be checking out in the morning and storing our luggage until the car service pick up at 4:30 p.m. for our 7:25 flight. Both bedrooms, plus the living area had an AC/heating unit. I never really figured out how to use them properly, and with two women \u201chot flashing\u201d and \u201cnight sweating\u201d throughout the night, we really needed it to blow cold air on demand! Ha! The unit in the boys\u2019 room seemed to not be cooling very well on our second day, but they never complained, so I never called to report it. If our visit would have been later in the spring or summer, I would have called the front desk to have them check the boys\u2019 unit and instruct us how to set our unit to blow \u201creally cold\u201d for hot flash/night sweat relief. For the most part, this was no big deal either. Kitchen - The kitchen was nice \u2013 full size refrigerator, with a stove, dishwasher, and microwave. Glasses, plates, and eating utensils were provided as well. Nearby Places \u2013 we went to D\u2019agostino\u2019s Market on 3rd Ave to stock up on a few staples. My girlfriend and I also ate at Good Burger on 2nd Ave. on our first night there. The boys were crashed out. We wore them out that first day, so combined with the early morning flight, they ran out of gas. Ha! At Good Burger, the burgers were, well, good. We also shared a Good Burger salad, and it, too, was good. On Thursday morning, we went to Sarge\u2019s Deli to buy sandwiches for our SOL/Ellis Island adventure. Sarge\u2019s is on 3rd Avenue near D\u2019agostino\u2019s. Good friendly service, huge sandwiches \u2013 very good!!! Grand Central Terminal is only a short walk away, and it was our travel hub during our entire visit. We bought 7 day unlimited Metro Cards and used the subway the entire time we were there. The Metro Cards were well used and well worth it... Summary \u2013 The Eastgate Tower is not luxurious, but still very nice. It is a decent place to lay your head, and it fit our needs perfectly. We were only in the room between midnight and 8:00 or 9:00 a.m., and I would much rather spend my money shopping, touring, eating, etc... I would stay at Eastgate again in a heartbeat, especially at the rates that we were so lucky to get...

When I called to ask to be moved to our reserved room we were told that there had been a mistake and there were no 1 bedrooms available-for either of our reserves 1 bedrooms! No one mentioned this when we checked in-like maybe we would not notice. After complaining to the front desk AND getting the manager, we were told they would take $50 off of our rate (basically charge us the full price of the room we got) and move us first thing the next day. The next morning we dropped off our two room keys, told the front desk that we packed our bags as instructed and expected to be in the new rooms by 3:00. The manager, Donna, had never mentioned any of this to the new front desk worker but she said she would take care of it. When we returned after 3:00 there was only 1, 1 bedroom available. The same manager, Donna, then claimed we never asked for 2, 1 bedrooms(regardless of the reservations made in January). After MUCH discussion we finally got the rooms we reserved. When we checked out the $50 credit was only taken off of one room until we complained AGAIN. Now for the Affinia group affiliation-don't even bother thinking you will get the preference items you can reserve at their site. I reserved a guitar for our stay on-line and called the hotel directly the week before our stay to confirm the guitar request. I was told by the Eastgate staff it was in our reservation.

The room was on the 9th floor and we had a good view with the top of the empire state building. The room was HUGE and had tons of closet space and two bathrooms (1 full, 1 half) which was great in the morning. The staff was very kind to bring us extra pillows and blankets because there wasn't much on the beds. The full size fridge was great and we bought breakfast items and drinks and stored leftovers. The living room furniture was comfortable and the TV's both worked well. As others have said, it was clean but not fancy, but the housekeeping did a great job every day to bring clean towels and make the beds. Conciege quickly brought us misc. items we needed, like salt and a corkscrew. For the down sides: The appliances were extremely old, and since there was only 4-5 plates and cups, we hand washed regularly. Once we tried using the dishwasher but it was very loud and took forever, then everything came out dirtier than they went in. The biggest complaint which made us miserable was the loud window heaters. None of us slept well because every time they came on, it banged and rattled and scraped so loud that it woke us up. The heater in the bedroom didn't work well and seemed to not even come on when it should so I was up in the middle of the night several times trying to adjust it. My son was sleeping on the couch and he confessed that it scared him every time it came on, thinking someone was coming in the door. It really was LOUD!

We booked the Junior Suite and we had so much space it was just a shock! * Kitchen facilities: It was so fantastic to have a full-size fridge and all the kitchen supplies and utensils to be able to have breakfast in the room. Meant we could have breakfast in bed before getting out and about for the day. * Loads of closet space: Ample room to hang clothes, as well as store your suitcases and other bits and pieces * Bathroom: Was clean and functional, with a tub for soaking in after an exhausting day * COMFORTABLE BED!! It was a really great bed, we slept very well every night we were there. * Housekeeping: They did a great job and our place was spotless everyday when we cam home. Linens changed daily. *Coffee maker: The coffee machine was just fab, and we loved the Wolfgang Puk coffee that was generously replenished every day * Helpful staff: All the staff who we dealt with were extremely helpful and gracious. They went out of their way to assist us with all the questions we had, and provided us with great maps and other bits and pieces. *Location, LOCATION! I thought the hotels location was absolutely perfect. It was a 4 minute walk to Grand Central, from there we got to anywhere in NY that we wanted to go. We walked to many places too, such as Rockefeller Centre, Empire State and Times Square. *The best thing about Eastagte Tower is the price! We paid just on US$200/night booking about 6 months out and paying up-front with Expedia, so we got a great deal. Some things that could be improved: *I guess the rooms are dated and could use a refurb, but I dare say that such an excercise would lead to a significant rate rise, and would probably be out of my budget then. I know people mention the dated decor, but seriously, it is clean and in good repair, so who cares if the place is a bit daggy? *Hotel's restaurant has been closed now for quite some time. But, with so many dining choices in Manhattan, I probably would not have eaten there anyhow *The Wi-Fi in our room had a week signal unless I sat very close to the door. I believe we were on the 7th floor - it wasn't cheap either, so that was dissapointing. In summary, I absolutely recommend Eastgate Towers to anyone who wants a clean, comfortable, roomy place to stay in Midtown Manhattan, without having to rob a bank to pay for it!

I chose it because it was more affordable than other hotels in Manhatten but I was soon to realise why! The hotel is located near the UN. It is about 3 blocks walk to Grand Central Station and about forty-five minutes walk from Time Square and all the tourist precincts. The whole hotel was in need of renovation and all the common areas and rooms were dingy. The restaurant was being renovated while I was there but this was not advertised in advance and meant that I had to go looking for breakfast every morning (The Frontier Grill on the next block proved quite good!) The rooms have a small kitchenette so it is possible to self cater if you are prepared but the facilities are dingy and so one doesn't feel inclined to prepare food and eat in. I also had trouble with very ancient and noisy air conditioning systems in the rooms which made it hard to sleep and to get the right temperature. The final straw, however, happened on my second night when I was woken at 4am by suspicious scrabbling in my suitcase. When I turned on the light, a brown mouse jumped out of my bags (he had been snacking on some nuts I had brought off the plane) and ran around the room. I called reception and asked them to come and deal with the situation but they didn't come until I rang again 20minutes later (apparently they went to the wrong room). When the night porter did arrive the mouse had vanished and he sat down and watched as I packed my own belongings in preparation for chaging rooms. Eventually at 5.30am I was transferred to another room (which proved to be a 2 bedroom suite). I must say that the Duty Manager was most apologetic when I spoke to him and I was allowed to keep the suite for the remainder of my stay at no extra charge. They also refunded the cost of the disturbed night so I appreciated their efforts to rectify the problem. All in all, I would not recommend this hotel until it has undergone a total refurbishment.

After a pleasant stay, I recently booked this hotel when I needed to stay in the city for a wedding. I called ahead of time to request early check-in. The hotel standard check-in time is 3pm and I was hoping for a 2pm check-in so that I could shower and get ready for the wedding, which was to take place at 3:30pm. I was told that early check-in could not be gauranteed, but that my request has been noted. I was also told that the hotel has a full locker room for their gym facility. Not wanting to go through the hassle of showering and getting ready for the wedding in a locker room, I called again a few days before my arrival and was told I would most likely not be able to get the hotel room early since the hotel was booked in full the night before. This made no sense to me considering check-out time is at noon and they had 3 hours to prepare rooms for 3pm check-in. Surely they could have one room available by 2pm for me? I arrived at the hotel a few hours early since my train got into the city that morning. Again I was fed the same story that I could not check-in early. When I inquired why, I got the same response about the hotel being booked in full the night before. I explained that I didn't understand how this worked and that it seemed unreasonable that my request of an hour early check-in could not be granted. Fortunately after going back and forth, the receptionist phoned their nearby, sister hotel land transferred me there without any problems or additional payments.

In the rush to leave in the morning, and with my mind on him and not me, I somehow left my diamond engagement ring in the room. I have worn this ring virtually every day for 36 years, and didn't even notice I didn't have it on until we were home later that evening. I had no idea where the ring was and called the hotel not knowing if I had even left it there. To my great pleasure, Yvrose, the Executive Housekeeper, immediately told me she had the ring. The housekeeper who cleaned the room, Elizabeth, had promptly turned it in and the ring was placed in the hotel safe. Since they couldn't know for sure which guest left it in the room they waited for the guest to call. Yvrose couldn't have been more helpful in arranging the return of the ring via Fedex. This was arranged on Saturday morning (I discovered the ring missing late Friday night), and since the safe was locked until Monday she had to arrange for the return of the ring in her absence, since as luck would have it she would not be in the following week. I subsequently spoke to Carol who confirmed the return of the ring, and called me the next day to make sure I received it.

The small galley kitchen had a large refrigerator, sink, stove and microwave, as well as some kitchen supplies. For a family it would be perfect, and for anyone visiting friends who doesn't care about hotel trimmings it is a hidden treasure.

In the spring I travelled with my husband and 2 children and stayed in a 1 bedroom suite. This time I travelled with an 11yo daughter and stayed in a Junior Studio Suite. Once again, I found the staff at the Eastgate to be proffessional, courteous and efficient. The room was large and clean, but as mentioned in almost all reviews, it is old and dated. The beds seem new and are made up in lots of white linens and are quite comfortable. I didn't do any cooking, nor did I have any desire to cook ... , but did use dishes, because we got takeout. I was surprised that there was only one pot and no pans in the kitchen. Although, if I had actually needed them I would have called housekeeping and asked. The kitchen I had in the spring was better equipped, but perhaps in the larger units people actually cook more. (But not me!) This room had a door that could be unlocked and opened to connect it to the room next door. It was secure but because of that door, sound from the next unit seemed to travel, and it just wasn't as quiet as during my first visit. Nonetheless, it worked fine for us. I was disappointed to see that the Frontier Diner on the corner of 39th and 3rd closed, but we were content with bagels from Daniel's and Scotty's on 39th and Lex is good for a sit-down breakfast. I enjoy getting out first thing in the morning and am not bothered by lack of breakfast in the hotel. If I really wanted it, I'd stock in cereal and fruit from D'Agostino's grocery on 3rd. If you are looking for an upscale fancy hotel, this isn't it. If you are bothered by mirrors that have gone dark at the corners and visible cables inside your closets, then stay away.

Location: We were visting NYC on a vacation. Location was very important to us to get around the city. We used the subway and walked, a lot!. The EGTH is about a 10 min. walk from Grand Central station. This is a hub for the NYC subway system, allowing you to travel east & west (line 7); north & south (lines 4, 5, 6). We conveniently walked to the following sites- NYC Public Library (15 min); Empire State Bldg (20 min); United Nations (5 mins). There were a few nice restaurants nearby, but not a ton of selection. Amenities: The hotel at one time was an apartment bldg, so each suite is spacious (not your typical tiny NYC hotel room). Each has a kitchen too, which was very handy for light meals. We were anxious to get going on our sightseeing, so it was great to grab breakfast as we got ready in the mornings. We didn't waste time sitting in a restaurant for breakfast, when there's so much to do in NYC! There are 2 grocery stores nearby to buy food for your stay. Just like many reviewers have already commented the furnishings in the room are dated, but they were clean and the beds were super comfortable- just what we needed after a long day of siteseeing! I should mentioned that the bathrooms were spotless- I'm a bit of a neat-niq so I can spot dirt from quite a distance, and this room fully met my picky standards. Value: What deal this hotel is for comfort, cleanliness & location! We booked months in advance on the hotel's website and booked one of their \"special\" rates that were being offered at the time- this was a great deal for a one bedroom suite (2 adults & 2 teenagers). What a pleasant surprise upon check-in to be upgraded to a 2 bedroom (& 2 bathrooms) suite. It was fantastic to have that second bathroom (my daughter could occupy it solely each morning without causing a family feud!). Service: Because we were so focused on siteseeing, we didn't spend a lot of time at the hotel. But the few interactions we did have with the hotel staff, were pleasant. One thing I did like, was that before I left for our trip, I checked tripadvisor reviews periodically. I liked that the hotel manager took the time to respond to most reviews, whether positive or negative. This suggests to me that he takes pride in his hotel and strives to respond to the needs of his guests. It you're looking for a luxury high end hotel, this probably isn't the hotel for you.

On another evening, one of the kids unwittingly locked the bathroom door as he exited, we called downstairs to get maintenance to come up and unlock it, and no kidding, he was there within 5 minutes!! I also highly commend the maids, they were accomodating on the days we let the kids sleep in, they would come late in the afternoon to clean the rooms.

This is an Affinia affiliate hotel. I read reviews on different websites, so I knew it wasn't the Ritz, but I don't need the Ritz when I am in NYC. I want a decent hotel in a convenient location because I'm only there to rest, change and sleep overnight before tackling another day. We got a 2-bedroom suite for $199 a night - great deal! The living room and dining area were very large! A pullout sofa, chair and 2 tables were in it, plus the desk. A large table with 4 chairs was there for eating. It had a small but full kitchen - microwave, dishwasher, stove, refrigerator, small coffee pot (they supply Wolfgang Puck coffee). The first bedroom had 2 queen beds and was as large as a normal hotel room. The 2nd bedroom had 2 twin beds. The room had 2 full bathrooms (small, but funcxtional). The beds were VERY comfortable! We slept like rocks every night! The bathrooms were basic, but the shampoo, conditioner, lotion and soaps were great! My friend and her daughter came with my daughter and I, and she has stayed at lots of nice hotels all over the workd, and she was impressed at how big it was for the price. The furniture was slightly dated and a bit worn, but nothing horrendous. I felt it was a good location - 6 block walk to Grand Central Station to get uptown or downtown, walking distance to Herald Square, a few blocks to The United Nations. I liked the location because it was quieter than staying in, for example, Times Square area. No traffic noise at all, no noise from other rooms. We seriously slept so well!! The staff was very friendly and helpful, but not too pushy or anything. There aren't any ice machines, but you just call Housekeeping, and they bring a bucket within 5-10 min.

The place needs a facelift, but is clean and spacious and the staff is pleasant, helpful and knowledgeable. We had a 1 bedroom suite ... the living room/dining area is HUGE ... with a sofabed, easy chair, desk, tv, dining table and chairs and plenty of room to move around. My 11yo did a lot of dancing ... just because she could -- lol! The bedroom had two queens, a nightstand, a 6 drawer dresser and TV. And plenty of space to move around. Large closets and a \"linen closet\" helped us to put all our suitcases and 'stuff' away so the room didn't get that cluttered look. The first two days were were there, we knew there was a large group of school-aged kids staying there for some kind of soccer event. We saw them in the halls and elevators, but once in our room ... we NEVER heard them. Our 8th floor corner suite was quiet ... The beds were comfy. Lots of white linens, even 'encasing' the blanket. The upholstery on the easy chair was worn, yet it seemed clean ... like the it had been steamed clean or something ... the wooden furniture and baseboards were nicked. But nothing horrendous. And that was all over-ridden by the space. We were a reasonable walk to Grand Central station where we could pick up multiple subway lines. 2nd and 3rd ave have everything you could need: pizza, bagels, deli, diner, grocery store and drug stores. The door man found us a taxi when we were leaving w/ luggage, other than that, if we wanted a cab we walked to 2nd or 3rd (depending on whether we were heading uptown or downtown) and never had trouble hailing a cab. I never cooked, but liked the spacious kitchen, with full sized fridge and even a dishwasher. We kept ALL our drinks cold, made coffee and microwaved popcorn. We got take-out one night, and it was nice to be able to sit at a table and eat normally rather than sitting on the edge of a bed an balancing everything on our laps like we'd have to do in a 'regular' hotel room. Bagels, cream cheese and nova from Daniel's on 3rd were great ... we ate our fill and refrigerated the rest for another day.

The hotel staff were professional and courteous, despite the slow check-in process, since we had to wait for our room to be cleaned well past the traditional 3pm check-in time. The hotel restaurant was closed, due to efforts to expand the existing hotel lobby, which is sorely needed -- the lobby can get a bit cramped even with only 10 people in the lobby!

Apart from the separate bedroom, it had a living/dining area, a large bathroom & a small self catered kitchen. We were on the 8th floor, so had a pretty good view of the buildings. The hotel itself is quite dated, but if that's not a problem, which it wasn't for us, then it's fine. The location is pretty good...you're about a ten minute walk to Grand Central Station. There are various shops just down the road from the hotel (convenience store, chemist, liquor store, pizza, burgers, McDonalds, chinese etc). The convenience store is very handy for bread, milk etc. Although it was freezing (snowing) outside when we were there, it was always toasty warm in our room. Some nights, we even slept in a sheet. The housekeeping ladies were always lovely. The only problem we really had, which isn't a biggie, was that every time we wanted to watch a pay per view movie, we had to keep ringing reception to get it uploaded, which was a bit of a pain, but as I said...no biggie. The only other little complaint was sometimes there was a weird smell on our floor once we got out of the elevator, but the smell was never in our room, so it didn't matter. There is a laundry in the basement for you to wash & dry your clothes. Definitely buy your own detergent as I brought some laundry powder from the lady at the counter & it ruined some of our clothes (bleached some of the colour out). This was really annoying because I specifically asked her if it was safe to wash my clothes in it & she said yes.

He had stayed there before with his band and they had very large 2 bedroom suites they felt were great, we had a one bed Studio suite room on this visit. The room we had was 25C, which is on the top floor with a nice view of the Empire State Building and the surrounding streets. We had requested in advance that we had a room near the top with a view ideally-as we were on honeymoon! When we arrived there we were greeted and quickly given our room key. The foyer was nice-very christmassy and welcoming. The corridor on our floor was very dated and faded and this was par for the course for the rest of the interior-basically it was all quite outdated, things were scuffed & marked. It was a very large room, lots of storage space, little kitchen area and bathroom - there were a few unwanted hairs in the bath, even though the place otherwise seemed spotless. It had a fairly cool view I thought! As the rooms are self catering, you can cook some meals yourself or at least have breakfast at home a few times-that in itself can save you a few bob! There is a lovely fresh food market in Grand Central Station that I would recommend if you were planning to cook a meal in your hotel room. The Hotel staff were consistenly pleasant and helpful and the room was serviced every day. There are loads of diners nearby to get a great breakfast in - our favourites were French Toast and Bacon, or Pancakes and Sausage!! I would recommend Scotty's Diner (39th & Lex), the Frontier (closest to Hotel, come out door, turn left, keep walking and its on the corner on the left before you cross the next avenue) or Sarge's (36th and 3rd, or maybe 37th..) - all of these had lovely breakfast. Scotty's do fabulous burgers too as we discovered very late at night -they are open 24 hours too!! There is a 24 Duane Reades nearby (they are a mix of pharmacy and grocery- have alcohol, sweets, medicines and very cheap make up!!) Murray Hill as an area is nice, we have stayed in that district before, the streets feel safe late at night, we never saw any trouble. The hotel is nice, I wouldn't pay anymore than we did though- I would confidently say too, that I suspect there are some pretty crap rooms in this place, so If you have a price you are happy with, request a top room with view to get best value. If you are not experienced with New York, then you should learn now, what we would expect from a standard Jury's hotel or Days Hotel bedroom in Ireland, would be considered positively brand new and luxurious for new york! You just have to accept this, lower your standards BIG TIME, unless you are prepared to spend an awful lot of money, expect small rooms, outdated facilites and no frills for a Manhattan hotel. You will always hear traffic noises - this area maybe had a fire station nearby as there were sirens going off constantly and the air con unit was seriously loud - if you need your sleep, bear this in mind!

Most of these hotels you have to go outside to turn yourself around. NOT at Eastgate Towers. My room was large. It had room for closet, a desk, a small refrigerator, microwave, and even cabinets with a few glasses and dishes. The Bathroom was large enough to close the door and not feel like you were on a cruise ship bathroom. It even had a double medicine cabinet with mirror and a vanity cabinet with extra towels, toilet paper, etc. My only 3 star rating is that it is a solid 10 minute walk to Grand Central to catch subway.

The fitness center was all but unusable for its stench, plus weights falling apart. It is a personal pet peeve that floors marked as non-smoking literally knock you over with a smoke smell when you get off the elevator. Internet access continues to be way to expensive, most places make it complimentary now, they still charge nearly $15/day. It actually replicates the experience of living in NY in a rundown, lousy apartment, instead of being the experience of staying in a hotel and even for an ex-New Yorker like myself it is getting too much. Staff are always nice, although given that there is nothing that they can provide, there is no reason for them not to be. Location is excellent and rooms are not as disgusting as the rest of the building, but I wonder how long that will last since nothing ever appears to be updated.

(Same chain.) At this hotel: check-in was weird. They never cited the agreed-upon rate or the number of days of the stay. I asked for a room on an upper floor. They assigned me to a smoking floor without telling me that. The room itself smelled like stale smoke. The furniture was shabby. We wound up leaving a little early -- the night before the morning of our scheduled check-out. when I called down to tell them that, they told me they would not be able to show me a printed bill or statement at night -- which means I never saw my room rate -- not at check-in or check-out!

This time the 2-bedroom suite, which is just like having your own little apartment in Manhattan. One bedroom had two queen beds, the other one had two twin beds. Each one had its own TV, apart from the TV in the living room, where there was a couch that turned into a huge sofa bed. We stayed in the 22nd floor after requesting a high floor (and the staff there is just amazing and polite). The elevators are not FAST, but they're definitely not slow. The kitchen was a huge help for breakfasts and a few dinners, instead of going out to eat. The suite also had two bathrooms, which was a big advantage having six people in the same room. The hotel is close to Grand Central, and there's diners and restaurants everywhere. We had breakfast the first day at the Frontier diner on 39th and 3rd. There's also a D'agostinos between 38th and 39th where we bought stuff to cook at the suite. Overall it was a very pleasant experience, and we'll definitely try to stay here next time if prices aren't too high. At first they WERE a bit high, so we booked another hotel.

I was a bit concerned when the hotel came up as being categorized as a 2.5 star by Priceline standards. Most of the reviews on Tripadvisor, however, were very positive so I decided not to panic until I saw the place for myself. Firstly, the hotel itself is literally two blocks from the Westin W Tuscany on the east side of Manhattan. The neighbourhood is a safe and clean part of the city. The hotel isn't that close to the subway but in Manhattan \"close\" is a relatively thing because you can be at the subway in about 10 minutes. The hotel is a converted apartment building so each room has a kitchen and livingroom area. My suite had a king sized bed and was basically a bachelor apartment. The furniture (as most noted) is old and could be replaced. The room and hotel have everything you'd find at a regular hotel. There are plenty of towels, toilettries, pay per view movies, individually controlled heat/ac, etc. The bathroom was old but clean and well stocked. I snuck a peak at the fitness centre on the second floor and it had a universal weight machine and some cardio. Not bad. The checkin staff were REALLY friendly. They told me all about the hotel and local restaurants as part of their greeting. I will say, for Manhattan these rooms would be considered HUGE! Most hotels give you a cubby hole and call it a room. Since this place was an apt, you'll be much happier with the size, especially if you're travelling with a family/children. Having a kitchen is a definite plus if you're going to be in the city for a long period of time. I am rating this a 4 because it really was a great price for the City.

This trip was for a family holiday. The hotel is in a great location and is wlaking distnace of a lot of attractions. I have to agree with one of the previous reviewrs and say that while the hotel is clean it felt a little grubby and is in need of a major refurb in terms of the decor. We stayed for 10 nights and the while the towels were changed daily the sheets weren't changed at all during our stay. On the first night the sofa bed in one of the rooms we had booked was full of crumbs and had no covers on it. We contacted the housekeeping staff and had to wait four hours for the bed to be made and cleaned so that someone could sleep in it. The noise from the corridor also made it hard to sleep at times. We were located in a room adjacent to what we think was a staff room and the door to this room was closed by a bang throughout the day and night which was quite irritating. The lifts were also slow and hard to get into at peak times. We found the front desk staff to be quite unhelpful. They gave us wrong advise on a number of ocassions. This was in relation to a range of things, for example on new years day they told us all of the major department stores were closed, which was in fact incorrect and theytwere all open. They gave wrong directions and seemed to try to push bus tours and booking these type of things through the front desk. This happened throughout our stay, we were careful to double check any information they gave us. When it came to checking out we found that the service of the front desk staff really failed. It took over an hour and a quarter to check out. One of the rooms was over charged, another was chraged out without telling the person having been told at check in that the credit card was a security thing only and that no chrages would be made until check out and the third rooms money was miss counted by the member of staff who found that they had made a mistake after very reluctantly agreeing to do a recount. The staff member at this point was quite difficult to deal with. It was a very bad way to finish off the stay. Overall I was very disappointed with my stay at the Eastgate. I am a frequent visitor to New York and don't intend to return to the East Gate,. I would also be very reluctant to reccomend it to a friend as we had so many problems.

The kitchen only has the essentials (including a toaster) but everything was clean and in working order.

Okay now for the part I don't like to write about but this stay started off as a complete disaster. We arrived for the 3pm check-in time that the hotel stated. We were told it would be 20 minutes more as the room was not ready. The bellman took our luggage up to the room while we went and sat outside. We checked back 25 -30 minutes later and were told the room still wasn't ready. The front desk person asked housekeeping to call her when it was done. She explained that the previous party had stayed for a late checkout... not sure why we had to suffer though... We checked back bit after 4 pm after sitting outside on the table and chairs next to the abandoned restaurant that once occupied the hotel building. When we went in and asked, the front desk person still hadn't heard about the room. She called housekeeping and they said that they didn't know if it was done and that the front desk should send the bellman to check on it. The bellman was no where to be seen at this point so we had to wait until 4:30 when he went up and gave the okay. We received our key-cards and headed to the room. Arriving in the room we found it to be dated but fairly clean and very spacious with nice city views... room 17 G. However, even though we booked a \"two queen beds and another queen bed suite\", we got a \"two queen bed with two twin bed suite.\" We even had Expedia call for us to verify that was what we would get but we didn't end up with it after all. The front desk explained that it can not guarantee a room type even though an Eastgate reservation person had guaranteed this to Expedia. We had to have a portable twin bed brought up so no one had to sleep in the living room. It was at this point we noted that the air conditioning in the twin bed room did not work, so we placed another call to the front desk and they said they would send up maintenance. They arrived within the half-hour and looked at the a/c unit. He determined it was a broken condenser and said the entire unit would be replaced but he had a new one. A short while later he returned with the massive unit and began to do the replacement. We were unable to unpack as this room was the scene of some major construction! About 30 minutes later he determined that the new unit was also bad and decided to try one more unit. The dinner hour was upon us and we were starving... but we had no idea if we would be keeping this room as it was partially un-airconditioned and it was 90 degrees outside. After waiting another 15 minutes or so, I went down to the front desk to discuss the general suckiness of our visit thus far and to speak with a manager. She arrived and her name I believe was Donna. She was very nice and helpful. She said she was willing to move us to another similar suite (2 queens, 2 twins) but it was on the 13th floor which was the smoking floor. We weren't too thrilled by that. She asked us to come see it and smell it with her as she felt most people don't smoke much anymore. We went her and it was nice and did not smell that much and had more up-to-date kitchen appliances. At that point, my cell phone rang... it was my wife and she informed me that the new a/c unit was in and working, so we went with Donna the manager to confirm. It worked great! Unfortunately it was now 7pm which was 4 hours from our scheduled check-in. After unpacking, we got to eat and proceeded on our late evening with the kids who were antsy and cranky now. Things seemed to be progressing... at least until I laid upon the most uncomfortable and squeaky twin bed I had laid upon since my childhood. Fortunately the days events had tired me and I slept well. The next morning, we all showered and tossed our towels on the floors in the bathrooms. We returned from a theatre matinee around 6 pm, ready to shower and go out to dinner at a nearby restaurant. Showers were put on hold because there was not one single towel in our room! So, of course, I called the front desk. They said they would tell housekeeping. 30 minutes later, no towels, so I called again. Again they said they would be right up. Another 30 minutes passed as I was about to reach for the phone again, the towels arrived... but there were only 3 of them... for 6 people. I asked the house keeping person why and they told me that they had run out of towels. Weird. They have tons of extra a/c units but lack towels? Well, some of us skipped showers and I went to the front desk on the way to dinner. I told them about how silly the towel situation and they promised more towels. When we returned from dinner, there were stacks of towels in both bathrooms and an extra big stack in the living room. I guess they bought more??? Anyway, After that our remaining three days were quiet and went smoothly. 2 of 4 nights/days were just fine.. is 50% okay for a visit that cost nearly $2k?

The location is in Midtown close to Grand Central Terminal, which is the closest subway station and about 6-9 minutes depending on the subway entrance. The UN is a few blocks away, and there are many restaruants and small markets nearby. Eastgate Tower is a 25 story tower with just 5 units on each floor. The lobby is cramped, but the staff is courteous, and we were able to get a nonsmoking room that we had previously requested. The elevators are small, but during our stay, waiting for elevators was not a serious problem. We stayed in a unit on the upper half of the tower in a unit with a view of the high rise next door that was about 20-25 feet away, so there was no view. The first thing you notice about the unit is that it is spacious but worn. Except for the bathroom and kitchen, it is a relatively large unit. However, the place seriously needs a new paint job inside, new carpeting, new vinyl in the kitchen, new tile in the bathroom and newer furnishings. Also the unit can use sound proofing from the 3 elevators in the center, and also use newer and quieter air conditioning units. Water pressure was good, the hot water was hot, the air conditioning and kitchen appliances worked. There were no bugs, but there was a strong pesticide odor in the kitchen cabinets. The rooms were cleaned everyday, but only as to what the eye could easily see. For example the inside of the refrigerator was relatively clean, but there was a thick layer of dust on top of the refrigerator. Same about the towel racks. The carpet was dark and likely hiding a lot of dirt, and we did not dare to look under the bed. Pros: Spacious, good water pressure, has kitchen appliances, and relatively safe neighborhood. Cons: Visibly worn interior, beds are sagging in the middle, noisy elevators and air conditioner. Was it worth the money? It depends on what you can get for $300 a night in midtown in June.

We enjoyed making breakfast and have some cold drinks when needed. With children, it is nice to have the flexibility of having the kitchen and more than one television was a definate plus. The time in NYC does go quickly, as there is a lot to see and even with the subways do plan on doing alot of walking, I regret we didn't do the double decker bus tour, we wanted to the last day of our trip but due to a heavy snowfall, they were not running.

When we pulled up to the hotel, it did not look too good and I was worried,but once we checked in, we were pleasantly surprised. It was spacious and clean. I have a few complaints and warnings I wish to give other potential guests. The first is the parking. There is valet parking next to the hotel and it is very expensive at $35.00 per day! To be clear, that is $35.00 + taxes + tip for the valet. There are plenty of parking lots around the area, but because there are so many one-ways, it gets confusing and you may be tempted to just park beside the hotel. Thats what I did and the car came back three days later with a huge scratch on the side. Because it is winter and there is lots of salt everywhere, we did not notice the scratch until later. So beware of the parking beside the Eastgate Towers, it is a rip off and your car will probably come back with some sort of damage! (Note that the hotel offers no discount at all, which is surprising because La Quinta, which is only a few blocks away gives you 50% off your total parking just for staying at the hotel. ) The second complaint deals with the reception of the hotel. There is one person at front desk and one or two \"attendants\" that stand around and open doors for people. If you have lots of luggage when coming in, the attendant will take your things and follow you up to your room. You will not be asked whether you actually want assistance, or desire to have a strange man follow you to your room, it will just happen. You will then be expected to provide a tip and the end of the encounter. This type of behaviour is quite strange for a budget hotel, so be prepared and have tip money handy. Lastly, regards the service. We went during restaurant week and we could not find one person at the front desk who could actually recommend a restaurant (and not simply read off the Zagat's survey). There is no concierge (i know it is a budget hotel), but a great alternative would have been to provide 5 or 10 minutes of free internet on the computer located in the entrance. Instead, they had some ludicrously expensive fees to surf the net even for a few minutes. So in conclusion, you will be comfortable inside your roomy hotel room at the Eastgate Towers, but do lots and lots of research before heading out, or else it will put a serious \"ding\" in your budget in more ways than one.", "Date": "January 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria, VA", "Title": "\u201cGood Value Good Location\u201d", "Author": "travelingnewbie", "ReviewID": "UR13063378", "Content": "My partner and I stayed for two nights over the MLK weekend.

I've stayed in New york before and this is by far the best hotel i have found to date. The reason i'm writing this review so quickly is that i noticed the 2 star review below me and the fellow giving the hotel a hard time. After seeing the review's low rating i read it in full and was surprised by everything they were saying! The lobby is too small? What does that matter? Are you sleeping there?? For the record their experience was totally different to the one i have just had and it seems that i must have been passing them in the corridor everyday! This is truly a hotel to recommend to friends. NY is notorious for packing in as many hotel rooms into a building as possible, meaning the customer often recieves a dinky room ... After experiencing this previously, one of my main criteria was to book a hotel whos rooms didn't look like a broom cupboard and the Eastgate certainly didn't let me down. The Studio room that we got was absolutely huge compared the other hotels i have stayed at in NY. It had a walk in closet, nice bathroom, a small sectioned kitchen (gas hob/oven, fridge, toaster, microwave, coffee maker) and a large main room and i only booked the basic Studio room (room 2E if anyone is interested). As some other reviewers have said, a agree that the decor was slightly dated although it was kept really clean and house keeping did an excellent job of tidying up every day. The location is between 2nd and 3rd on 39th street, meaning the area and roads are rather quiet. I heard the occasional siren and honk of a horn but nothing that could be considered a nuisance. As for attractions, the Eastgate is slightly further than most, although (unlike the reviewers below me) if you come to NY you expect to walk a distance everyday. Time Square and the Empire state are wel within walking distance taking around 15/20 minutes, although i would say if you come to NY to catch the buses everywhere then get something a little closer. There are loads of places to eat from a nice posh restaurant round the corner to a McDonalds on the corner of 2nd/39th. A 24hr pharmacy is on the otherside of 2nd Avn and a Supermarket is one block north to fill your fridge with cookies and Dr Pepper. The staff are brilliant, everyone i talked to, whether asking directions or getting recommendations for a place to eat, i found to be helpful and friendly ... definately top marks there. Myself and the lady have already said that the next time we come to New York we are staying at the Eastgate, it simply is an excellent hotel to stay at. I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind walking an extra 5 minutes to attractions, and if your willing to make the sacrifice you get an oversized room, excellent value for money and a hotel that i will be visiting everytime i return.

First impression at 11pm arrival was shock at the tiny, institutional looking lobby, and horror after transporting my own luggage upstairs (security guard/bellman had gone on break) at the depressing, shabby, filthy two double bed (despite request for one king) studio suite - located between the elevator, gym and compactor - that cost $400 for the first night. (Quikbook booking gave different rates for each night.) Was told there were no other rooms available until it was discovered that the door to this room did not lock. Was sent to another horrible studio for the night and the next morning given the choice to upgrade to a junior suite. Much larger, seemingly cleaner (NO ancient bedspreads but the floors were just as grimy.) New rate was slightly higher. I forgot to mention AAA membership at the time of the adjustment and was not allowed to apply it when I called Management the next day. I stayed at the hotel for 12 nights for about $4500. For the most part, staff were extremely polite and helpful. They assured me that renovations were \"going to start any time\" for as long as they'd been working there (20 years in once case). Door to the junior suite failed to lock half the time unless properly jiggled but it was still shocking to come home to a wide open door at 1 a.m. Beds hard as table tops but no bugs. Air conditioning effective. Laundry located in basement next to housekeeping. Many foreign guests seem to be a reflection of nearness to U.N., as are numbers of security personnel with big dogs. Nice scenic walk on First Avenue to UN and Tudor City. Express buses do not stop at 39th street. Don't know if I would stay here again. Would not recommend it to friends without many caveats.

The room was huge, even NOT by NYC standards. I've stayed in hundreds of hotel rooms, including suites, and this one was probaby one of the largest I've ever experienced. There was a big dining room with a family-size table, a huge living room with a sofa, chair and TV, a full kitchen (although small), a large separate bedroom with two queen beds and tons of closet space, and a small bathroom with tub. We could not believe how much space we had. You could easily have 6 or more people staying in there, comfortably (except for sharing the small bathroom). I'm assuming the building used to be apartments. I booked my room through Priceline. I think it was about $165, well below what you would expect to pay for such a big space in NYC. True, the furniture is dated and somewhat worn, but who cares? If they updated everything, you'd have to pay way more. How much time do you spend in the room in NYC anyway?

The Eastgate has worked beautifully every year - they have so many options to choose from, room-wise. One bedrooms, two-bedrooms, studios - whatever your needs, they have a room that fits. For the last two years, we've had our baby with us on the trip, and both times, they've been able to provide a REAL crib (not a flimsy pack and play) for her to sleep in.

They seem to bend over backward to be family-friendly and accommodating. The hotel is tucked onto a quiet street between two busy avenues - quiet enough, but easy walking distance to the Grand Central subway stop, pharmacies, grocery stores and restaurants. The rooms themselves are HUGE by NYC standards - lots of room for a toddler to play after a long day in the stroller sight-seeing. The kitchenette is particularly useful when traveling with kids, as well. It is true that the place needs a renovation - it's getting a little shabby with scratched and dented furniture and threadbare carpeting, but it is kept immaculately clean by the very friendly housekeeping staff.

Grand Central is only a 5 minute walk away (I don't see how anyone could describe it as further away... the entrance you need is more or less at the corner of 3rd and 42nd) and this means everything in the city is only a change of a train away.

We were not disappointed. We took a cab from LaGuardia and once in Manhattan it was an easy drive to the Eastgate. The lobby is very small and can be claustrophobic when it's crowded. We arrived early - around 10:15 am - and though we were initially told our room was not ready, a manager stepped in, changed our room assignment, and we were in. Our room was a Junior Suite, which includes a small but complete kitchen, large sitting area with table & chairs, sofa-bed and armchair, a king-size bed and bath. The room had a large dresser, two nightstands and three(!) closets - plenty of storage for our clothing and luggage. The set-up was great for 2 adults and 2 kids. The bathroom was small and did not have much counter space, but there was storage under the sink and in mirrored cabinets above the sink. The room and furniture were clean and the bed was comfortable. The carpet could use a throrough cleaning, or should be replaced. It always felt somewhat damp. The bathroom wallpaper was pretty tired, but the bathroom was clean with plenty of hot water. We had a 24th floor room overlooking 39th Street, which isn't terribly busy so the room was quiet. There was a huge window, with smaller side windows that open - we had unseasonably cool weather during our stay so it was great to be able to enjoy fresh air. The neighborhood is safe, with small groceries and fast food options nearby. We grabbed coffee each a.m. at the Starbucks on Lexington and 40th and bagels at Bagels & More on 39th & 3rd Avenue. There isn't much in the way of restaurants or shopping in the immediate area, so you'll need to venture out for these. The walk to Grand Central was an easy one and we took the subway everywhere. Sites such as the Empire State Building and Times Square were easily walkable, as is shopping on 5th Avenue. If you're traveling with kids and need a cool break in the sightseeing frenzy, visit the St. Vartan's playground on 1st Avenue just a few blocks from the hotel. Our kids loved it and we enjoyed sitting in the shade and relaxing after a full day of walking.

The area felt very safe to walk around at night. Also close by is the Frontier diner where you can get a decent breakfast (they'll also deliver breakfast to your room for no extra charge). But if you fancy more of a treat, try Pershing Square outside Grand Central. The pancakes were amazing and the waffles were huge. Probably a bit pricey by US standards ($12) but a bit cheaper compared to London, given the sheer size of the food.

Cab ride would've been a $45 flat rate. Our first experience at the Hotel wasn't good...the front desk person wouldn't provide our room at 1:00 pm as it \"wasn't ready\". The bellman overheard and volunteered to check the room himself. I think he saw that I had planned to have the girls nap (had been up since 4:00 am) right on the lobby couches until the room was ready and smartly offered to get us in. Not sure why the front desk didn't check to see, but it helps to be persistent. Room was already made up and available. Housekeeping was then great with quickly providing extra linens and towels. The room was very large. We had a \"1 bed suite\" ($270 first night, $215 second night). It wasn't really a suite with a door to the bedroom, but it had a sitting area as well as a table with 4 chairs. Kitchen was adequate--just used the refrigerator and freezer. Furniture was a bit worn and dated. Blankets provided for the pull-out couch were filled with holes. Bathroom was tiny and not as clean as it could've been. The hairdryer was especially dirty, and there were several cracks in the mirror and tile. Bed was comfortable and the room was quiet on the 10th floor.

However, prices there have increased significantly. I was very happy with the room and with our stay at Eastgate. The bellman arranged a town car for us back to JFK for a $50 flat rate. Nice driver; enjoyed much better than a cab ride. Kids loved it! The location of this hotel is great--walked to Grand Central Station, Empire State Building, all the great restaurants on 3rd Avenue, Times Square, Bryant Park, and even to Rockefeller Centre. Only took 3 cab rides in 3 days. The Gray Line double-decker bus tours are outstanding. You can get on and off at various parts throughout the city (buy tickets online for a $5 savings).

There were 2 little bathrooms each with a hairdryer (bath AND shower). The little kitchen was much used, and had everything we needed. The available space was fantastic. We enjoyed being together but not \"confined\". Location was great. Sadly my 20 year old's phone went unexplicably missing from her bedside( was using it as an alarm clock ). The verdict remains open on that one. The staff were as helpful as they could be in the circumstances. The view from front and back windows was excellent.

Space is a luxury in New York, so we were definitely pleased and the free upgrade was a nice bonus!", "Date": "February 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston Mass.", "Title": "\u201ca disappointment\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4347071", "Content": "i was disapionted with the eastgate tower, the suite i stayed in was spacious but VERY outdated, the lobby was very nice, but small, also the fitness center had minimal offerings and needless to say was very small, i would not recommend this hotel unless you are on a tight budget and need to stay there", "Date": "January 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "austin, tx", "Title": "\u201cGreat, clean, informal hotel for great price\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4333770", "Content": "We stayed in Eastgate Towers in Jan 2006 for a weekend. The cost was comparable to budget hotels in the city, but our room was a very spacious suite, which included a kitchenette. This is not a posh hotel by any means, but it is clean, affordable and (unusual in New York) not an overpriced rip=off. There is also an internet terminal in the lobby with a very reasonable cost to use. The hotel is easily accessible to subways and buses and taxicabs, and very close to many different restaurants, including one that provides room service. Overall a very satisfying experience, there will be no surprises with this place!", "Date": "January 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel in Excellent Location\u201d", "Author": "AstridCB", "ReviewID": "UR4313363", "Content": "We have just returned from spending 4 nights at the Eastgate Tower Hotel and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who is visiting New York and wants a central hotel without paying huge prices. Yes, it's a basic hotel and yes, the lifts leave a lot to be desired (one was not working while we were there and being on the 23rd floor meant a long wait at times), however, it's location (just 5/10 minutes easy walk to Grand Central Station and about 10/15 minutes to the Empire State Building) and the friendliness of the staff make it a hotel I would certainly recommend and stay in again.
