I guess because of the renovation, this charge was also not assessed. The hotel is located about a 10-15 minute walk from the Space Needle/Seattle Center. So getting to downtown Seattle was very convenient because of the monorail. The monorail will take you to about 2 blocks away from Pike's Market.

I've been to all of them but this hotel piqued my interest as it offers a more \"value\" price point. I was recently here for a weekend with my wife. I noticed that this hotel opened up their Cash & Points inventory so had to jump on that as it's an outrageously good deal. As a Starwood Plat member, I was also interested to see what they could offer. The Location As others have mentioned, it's a bit off the main area for downtown. It's a short walk to the monorail station and that can get you back/forth from downtown for cheap. Myself, I drove from downtown to this hotel. A word of warning - research the routes well before you go. Getting on to 5th Ave North was such a pain. Other than that, we really didn't stay around the area much so can't comment on how safe/diverse it is. Lobby/Check-in/Parking When I arrived, the front desk wasn't full. While they did ask me what I wanted for a Plat amenity, I wasn't really explained what other Plat bennies there were even though I explained it was my first time at this hotel. Also, I note that I wasn't put into an upgraded room (other than being on the 4th floor) but I stressed that I wanted a quiet room. More on that later. The lobby area itself is completely remodeled and looks quite contemporary. I did pay for the parking but noted the gate was open when I drove in. I was a bit uncomfortable with the security situation there but noticed the gate was down when I left in the morning. Room The room itself was a king bedroom with a sofabed pull-out. Myself, I thought the size of the room wasn't anything special - long but narrow. Having the sofabed was nice as we had brought dinner with us and sat down on the sofa to eat it together. There's the normal LCD tv and there were quite a few channels. The bathroom was a normal size and noted the sink counter area was a good size. I do also need to comment on how \"quiet\" it was. I was placed in the inner quadrant with the window facing the roof of a warehouse and then Aurora Ave N. The sound insulation on the windows is so poor that the car noise from Aurora actually came into the room. I've got to say that I'm not right above Aurora. Rather, I'm a good distance from it. A bit disappointing. Perhaps the only other solution is to have a room facing Roy St? Food I did have breakfast in the hotel resto with my wife. Service was prompt and friendly. Food was ok but the cut potatoes were horrid. Coffee was a bit watered-down - which is a surprise given that it's Seattle. Check-out When I checked out, they couldn't give me a printed folio right away as it seemed the front desk didn't know how to handle a Cash & Points booking. No problem, I told them to email it to me after they figured it out. I did receive it later with no problems. I also wanted to mention that the person checking me out noticed that I wasn't given an upgraded room as a Plat. She made it up to us and we were extremely pleased with the outcome. Final verdict Would I come back? Probably. I just have make an accommodation since the hotel isn't right in the downtown core. Would I refer a friend? Probably, also making sure fair warning was given regarding the location. However, the value proposition here is so good that I'm pretty sure I'll return. Problems encountered: 1) There was no in-room RJ45 cable so I called down to have one brought up. Once plugging it in, the wired internet did not work. I just gave and used wireless. However, I prefer wired as it offers a bit better security. 2) One of the bathroom lights \"seemed\" to be burnt out when I checked-in. As the other was working, I didn't bother calling down to have it replaced. Strangely enough, both lights were working fine the next morning. Very strange.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, clean and new in Seattle Centre (Space Needle)\u201d", "Author": "carrieryan", "ReviewID": "UR119161449", "Content": "We stayed at the Sheraton Four Points last weekend.

I wasn't too thrilled because I have generally been pleased with Comfort Suites' hotels and underwhelmed with the Sheraton Four Points chain. To their credit, they honored our rate and free parking but we probaby wouldn't stay here again. The changes that have been made were not for the better. The rooms seem to have been shrunk from a much larger Comfort Suite size to a typical hotel room. The parking is no longer free (unless you booked when it was a Comfort Suites) and you no longer get a free breakfast either. The rooms have been remodeled with more modern styling but not everything works quite right, especially in the bathroom. The clear glass shower door is hard to open from the inside as there is no handle on the interior part of the door. In addition, the shower door didn't open all they way out. The toilet paper roll also kept falling off the modern looking toliet paper holder. We had a SUV (Chevy Traverse) and were able to get the car in the garage with no problem. The garage has a gate that can only be opened with a valid hotel key, so it felt very secure. The parking in the garage below the hotel is tight but we were able to get a spot when the hotel was full because of the Labor Day Holiday. Location of the hotel is fairly good. The area is very nice and you are within walking distance of the Space Needle and monorail station. The monorail will take you to within 3 blocks of Pike Place Market or you can take a taxi. You will probably have to pick up the taxi at the Space Needle because the Four Points is off on a side street. Some rooms do have views of the Space Needle but they also face a busy, high speed road below, which can be quite noisy.
