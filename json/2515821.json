We are a family of 5, we had a 2 BR suite. The master was huge with a king bed, TV and full ensuite. We did not have a room with a view of the Bellagio fountains, which we had asked for, but we could see the Bellagio out of the windows and on the roof of the hotel there are cameras that stream live footage of the fountains and the strip straight to the big TV in the room. That was the next best thing and we appreciated that. The second BR had a Queen bed and there was a fold out queen in the lounge room. It had a full kitchen, but we were hardly there so we didnt use it. It was very clean and smoke free, the advantage of not staying in a casino. The location could not be better, it is nestled between the Bellagio and the Cosmopolitan, across the road from Paris and Planet Hollywood, and the Miracle Mile shopping complex where we spent a fair bit of time! The pool is no good, small and gets no sun but you have access to the Cosmopolitan pool (you have to ask about that, it wasnt offered but we knew about it from here!). The Cosmo pool is lovely and has a bar and bikini clad waitresses. Its a nice place to take a rest from the antics of the strip. It is a time share hotel and you will get invited/offered to attend their meetings, we were on to that (again, from trip advisor reviews!), and stopped them in their tracks barely before they got a few words out! We didnt find it a problem. I would highly recommend the Jockey Club, especially for a family with kids.

Here is what you need to know: -Excellent location on the Strip. Easy access to the highway and all of the attractions -Two bedroom suite was great. One room had two beds and the other had a single. Two bathrooms (one with a full sized shower, the other with a tub). Large living room, full kitchen, three TVs, stereo...it was great! -Not all rooms have a view. The Cosmopolitan was built after the Jockey Club. All of the rooms on one size of the building have a view of a cement wall. We were on the other side and had a great view. -The pool is small, private and heated (open 24 hours). There is a gym, hot tub and sauna. You can use the Bamboo pool at the Cosmoplitian if you show them your room card. Here are a few tips: -When arriving park in the 15 minute area, check in to get your parking pass and then you can self park on floor B3 of the garage. This saves you paying for a valet -Just check in and get your room key. Don't listen to the people that are going to offer you \"welcoming gifts\", raffles, etc. I did not get hit up for time share at all by just avoiding these folks. They are directly across from the check in area. We really enjoyed our stay at the Jockey Club and we plan on returning. I have stayed in Vegas several times and this was my favorite location.

Stayed in room 400 which is a handicapped accessible. The only complaint being close to the elevator which had an annoying squeak. Also, the shower did not get as hot as I like, but that may have been ahandicapped safety feature. Let it run and it eventually was ok.

The location is excellent - according to their website the hotel is \"snuggled between the Cosmopolitan and the Bellagion\" The hotel has been renovated - but the fact remains that it is one of the older buildings on the Strip. While I was on the 4th floor, facing noirth, and had a view of the Bellagio fountains, I also was able to hear noise from outside (something you don't hear in the newer hotels) There were noisy guests on my floor on a couple of weekends but otherwise it was relatively quiet. There is a full kitchen, and a large living room and bedroom. The bathroon, however, is very small. Big enough for me, but not for two or more people. And, because the bathroom is in the bedroom, it would be rather awkward if there was another couple occupying the sofabed in the living room. There is a shuttle that goes to the grocery store (Smiths) three times a week. There is also a shuttle that goes to both outlet malls once a week. Very handy for those who do not have a car. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Housekeeping every day is included. The only warning I have is to watch out for the timeshare people. They did not bother me because I am female and was by myself, but they were hauling in naive tourists from the Strip with promises of free dinner and show tickets and I overheard some of the hardcore \"closers\" discussing their tactics to sell to the vulnerabl. All in all, it is not a bad place to stay. However, I have stayed at the Signature with the high-end furnishings and finishes, so I had a difficult time not comparing the two places.

I loved everything about it (4 stars due to it being a bit dated). Our Trip: Six friends spending 8 days/7nights in Vegas for three reasons - 1st - I was going to CES, 2nd - My Fiance' was previous Miss Wisconsin contestant and wanted to go watch her friend (Miss Wisconsin - now Miss America) compete, 3rd (most importantly) - I wanted to party my a$$ off. I booked through VRBO months in advance (before CES showed up on the radar) so I was able to get a 2bed/2bath unit with the Bellagio Fountain view, 7 nights for $1100 including taxes. Amazing deal. Our group: Two sets of couples -my fiance' and I and my old college roomie and his girlfriend... the other two were single guys. We split up the sleeping situation with my roomie and his girlfriend in bedroom2 with a single queen bed. Myself, my fiance had a queen bed in bedroom1 which had anothor queen bed where one of the single guys slept. The other guy used a roll-away or the pullout couch in the living room.... we never felt cramped. The huge walk in closet was great for keep everyone's stuff off the floor and out of the way, very nice feature. The Actual Stay: Amazing. Wednesday of CES check in was a breeze (only one person ahead of us in line), other hotels seemed to have 60 min+ waits. The room was ready about 2 hours ahead of time so we went up and loaded our things... then took a limo off the strip to get some food/booze/supplies... the nice thing is the Cosmo valet/limo pickup is about a 60 second walk from the JC entry. Very nice. 7 days worth of food and booze felt easily in the kitchen (which was fully stocked) and had nice newer appliances. The best part of the kitchen was the ability to keep all of our drinks cold between the fridge/freezer; the second best part was coming home from a night out we would always have the drunk munchies so being able to cook a cheap frozen pizza on a whim saved soooo much money compared to a 3am slice somehwere on the strip... and being able to take leftovers back was a nice perk. Since our trip would mostly consist of going out/partying the room was perfect. We had plenty of room for the girls to get ready and the guys could still shower/etc... not having to share a bathroom was great. Also before going out we were all able to sit around a table and drink/pre-game/etc before we left the room... honestly we spent more time than I would have liked in the room because it was so big/nice. The location of the JC cannot be beat - at all. Its amazing how in hotels with a casino it takes 15/20 mins to actually get onto the strip, with the Jockey Club we could go from our 7th floor room to walking down the strip in about 60 seconds. No other hotel can offer that. Also if you wanted to gamble you could take the direct elevator to the Cosmo casino floor in about 60 seconds as well... I doubt Cosmo guests could get there that quickly... and to be to the Bellagio casino floor it was about a 3 minute walk (most of that was on their moving sidewalks). Honestly you cannot beat the location and proximity to the strip itself. The ammenities of the hotel are pretty darn good too. They have a ton of dvds for rent (we didn't use this at all though), TVs in the living room and both bedrooms. A stereo that we were able to hook up Ipods/laptops for music (we brought our own cords though - not provided). The pool, fitness center, and hot tub were open 24/7. The pool area is really cool at night, and the pool was heated although outdoors, we were able to swim (usually drunk) in January, and the hot tub was indoors. There was a small store in the building but the prices were high enough to make walking to an ABC/Walgreens a much better option. The staff was all very friendly, from cleaning, to valet, front desk.... everyone. In our week there we did not get bugged about a timeshare even once. Once or twice we did get a knock on the door about our noise level, but they were very nice and polite - we would quiet down or go out and never had to have them come back.

We were there for a bachelor party, and we wanted to have a place for everyone to hang out without being in individual hotel rooms. Both of our condos were great -- not five star, mind you, but recently renovated with comfy beds, fully stocked kitchens, two full bathrooms with huge warm showers, and lots of living area to hang out with the group. A few things that really set Jockey Club apart from other accommodations: 1. Location - right in the middle of the southern strip, attached to the Cosmo and next door to the Bellagio. 2. Price - two bedroom condos for the price of a hotel room at the Cosmo. 3. Cosmo Amenities - direct access to the Cosmo casino through the \"secret\" Jockey Club elevators, plus access to all of their incredible pools just by flashing our key cards. Plus, reserved spots in their garage, access to tennis courts, etc. 4. JC Amenities - 24 hour pool, hot tub, and exercise room. Gas grills and picnic tables out by the pool. 5. Friendly Staff - Everyone we encountered was polite and laid back. The front desk staff went out of their way to help us out, give directions, etc. Finally, here are some tips if you decide to stay at the Jockey Club: 1. Ask for a room with a view. One of our rooms looked out over the Bellagio fountains and the strip. The other looked out at a concrete wall. The Jockey Club is either feast or famine when it comes to views. 2. Rent a car and use the Harmon Ave. entrance to the Cosmo. You'll skip all the traffic on the strip, and get a reserved spot in the self park garage. Simply drive into the Cosmo valet area, proceeding down the ramp that says \"Self Park\". Then take two quick left turns and you'll be on level B2. Take four more quick left turns and you'll be down to level B3. Proceed about half way through the parking garage until you see a digital \"space meter\" on the ceiling showing the number of spaces left in the garage. Look to your left and you should see a set of discrete double doors and a (very!) small sign that you can't read. Park your car, and you'll notice the small sign says \"Jockey Club Elevators\". 3. Make use the \"secret\" elevators. See directions in step 2 for how to access the elevators from the parking garage. The elevators go to three other places -- the first floor of the Jockey Club with a confusing walkway to the lobby, the first floor of the Cosmopolitan Casino (remember the location of the doors so you can find your way back), and the second floor of the Jockey Club, right beside the Jockey Club Pool. The second floor stop is the best way to access your room in either tower -- just walk past the pool and to the appropriate \"tower\" elevator. Needless to say, these elevators make it very easy to access the amenities at the Cosmo without walking outside. 4. Book through a reseller (such as Las Vegas Tourist Bureau).

Although the Jockey Club looked like a nice place to stay, we attended the tour and came out without buying anything. Here's where the problem is: The comps offered to us were all completely worthless with the exception of the $50 VISA card. They gave us tickets to a show that was already offered for free in a coupon book that we had picked up earlier at our hotel. The other tickets given to us were not for a major production show and actually required a purchase to get in \"free\". The $400 gambling money was only good at the Casino Royale and only good on their \"promotional\" slot machines with no possibility of winning any actual money. In other words it was like playing \"Monopoly\" money to win \"Monopoly\" money. They also gave us a 3 day/2 night stay which required another time share presentation.

(We had requested it after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor, but were afraid we might get one facing the wall of the Cosmopolitan.) As many other reviewers have said, it's in a perfect location. We found it very relaxing to go back to our room through a small reception area with no casino to plow our way through. It was so quiet! Our room was very tastefully renovated so the furniture, carpets, linens, kitchen set up (including dishwasher!) were all new. For the price range one wouldn't expect a walk in closet and the spaciousness and convenience of a suite. We had a one bedroom suite which would be fine for a family with two or three children using the pull out sofa and the other sofa in the living room for the children. However, it wouldn't be as good for two couples since the bathroom is in the bedroom off of the living room. We loved the space and the well equipped kitchen so that we could make breakfast and lunch to take with us. I have given it an excellent rating because it surpassed very good. However, I should mention that when we arrived the picture window and two windows attached to it were very dirty and unpleasant to look through so I went to the desk to ask to have them cleaned. They said housekeeping couldn't clean them because it was a different company that cleaned them. We were lucky to have two walking sticks with us so we attached a wet face cloth to one using plastic from a bag to hold it on and to the other we attached a dry cloth. We were able to get our arms out the windows enough to wash and dry the windows. It made a huge difference to our enjoyment of the room! Also we went to the timeshare presentation as we were told we would be given $200. to use in slots but as usual in those types of things, there was a catch. We went to the Casino Royale where we were to use the coupons and were told that we could only cash out winnings if we hit the jackpot. At one point we had $768. but couldn't cash it in because it wasn't the jackpot. So be cautious, as others have said about going to the presentation - we didn't use anything else they gave us, and we spent at least two and a half hours fending off the offers of deals.

We obtained the reservations from our travel club Global Discovery Vacations. When we arrived, I was clearly distressed at the site of the place. It is a little hotel surrounded by the Belagio and Cosmopolitan. The first floor lobby and \"concierge\" service had a terrible smell that caused you to gag. We had explained that we had stayed at a hotel on Fremont Street the previous night and needed to check in as soon as possible. They didn't have our rooms ready, so they stored our luggage and told us we could check in at the normal time of 4:00pm. We called several times between 4:00pm and 5:30pm when both of our rooms were finally ready and they kept telling us only one room was ready. The rooms were okay. They seemed clean enough and the housekeeping staff was very friendly. The ceilings in the entire place are very low, maybe 7 or 8 feet max and it made it seem cramped and congestive. The elevator from the lobby had a cheap dirty curtain around the interior with a gaping hole in the corner. We had to take that to the second floor and walk down a long hallway, down stairs and take another elevator to our room on the 9th floor. On the first night, our room key wouldn't work when we went back to our room. We called the front desk from our daughter and son-in-law's room and were told we had to speak to security. They refused to let us back into our room without our seeing our ID. I explained that our ID's were in the room and I would be happy to show them if they could let me in. After arguing with them for better than 20 minutes and going down to the office, we were finally let in an issued a key that worked. The guy working the \"concierge\" desk was dirty, smelled and was pretty rude. He was offering free tickets to nothing of any value. The pool doesn't get any sun and is covered with some kind of net with a bunch of light bulbs attached to it. It was fine at night, but if you're looking to get a tan go somewhere else. We were told we could use the pool on the 14th floor of the Cosmopolitan, but when we went up there, it was closed for the season and the security guard made us leave. The day we left we went to the front desk and asked if they could call us a cab. We were told we had to ask the valet. He said it would be a long wait if he called and told us we could get a cab faster if we went to the Cosmopolitan. I told him I wasn't dragging five pieces of luggage over there. My husband ended up running up there and came back with a cab in less than 5 minutes. If you don't mind staying in a sub standard hotel, the rooms aren't bad. However, when people asked us where we were staying, it was embarrassing to tell them.

We wanted to stay on the Strip but didn't want to pay the exorbitant prices at the really posh places. We also had three adults and two small children and wanted to get a room that could accommodate everyone. Enter the Jockey Club. We got a two bedroom, two bath suite with kitchen (including a dishwasher, microwave, and stove), dining area, and living room, for less than half the cost of a room at most of the other places. The Jockey Club doesn't have a casino - I think it's a bunch of timeshares - but it feels just like a hotel, complete with (very friendly) housekeepers who come every day (if you want them to; otherwise just put out the \"do not disturb\" sign) and valet parking (if you want it). Our suite was very nicely decorated and quite comfortable. There were a couple of pamphlets in the room on timeshares, but other than that there was nothing in the way of a sales pitch whatsoever. I had read some reviews of how confusing the layout is, and while I would agree that's fairly true when you first get there, after you ask for directions once it's pretty easy to get to the same places again, be it the parking garage or the Cosmopolitan. I had also read some reviews of how terrible the views can be, and maybe it's because I was forewarned, but it didn't bother me. All of our windows had a view of the side of the Cosmo, which actually made it very private! (that part of the Cosmo doesn't have windows) Our friends who had a lovely room at the Bellagio had a view of the parking lot there, so sometimes you just don't get a good view. That certainly wasn't our main reason for coming to Vegas, and didn't bother me in the least. Speaking of the Cosmo, we got full use of their Bamboo Pool. I don't know if we could have used the others, but we had a small child with us and they said that was their most family-friendly. The pool was amazing - a great place for lounging for hours and with a bar on two ends. It was also very convenient to go to the Cosmo for dinner - we did that twice - and the casino, and the Jockey Club is also next door to the Bellagio and across the street from Planet Hollywood and its Miracle Mile of shopping. I felt like we were the smartest travelers on the Strip because we got a great room for a really great price (my friend who booked it found that the price available directly through the Jockey Club's website was about half of that on the so-called discount sites, so be sure to check the official website), while still getting to use the amenities of the surrounding high-end resorts.

The property is in a good location along the strip, although rather set back from the strip and is hard to spot sitting amongst the over towering Cosmopolitan casino and hotel directly next door (literally next door...only a few feet separate the 2 properties). The room I stayed in was a one bedroom suite and included a full size refrigerator, kitchen with stove, sink, dishwasher, oven, microwave, and a full set of utensils for cooking and eating. The bedroom and bathroom in this suite unit were sectioned off from the rest of the room, so not a standard hotel room by any means. There was a tv in the living room (another in the bedroom) along with a boom box for the music lovers. Outside of the decor of the room (horse motifs and the dark colors and patterns on the living room furniture....just not my personal style) I was satisfied with the overall quality of the room. The bed was a lot less firm than what I am used to, but it served its purpose and above all else, it was clean. This location is a time share property and although for my stay I was not required to do a tour or sit through a presentation, you may see others getting the sales pitch depending on where your room is located. My room just happened to be on the second floor and right down the hall from where the presentations and tours take place. Having access to The Cosmopolitan right next door is a big plus. The only real negative comment I have relates to the walkway pedestrians have to use to enter and exit the Jockey Club. It is better than no walkway at all, but it would be nice if somehow there could be a walkway built to connect the Jockey Club with the Cosmopolitan for easier access to both the strip and taxis.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Forest Grove, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cGlad We Went Back a Second Time\u201d", "Author": "Retiredbarnqueen_10", "ReviewID": "UR116959933", "Content": "We are the type of couple who like to vacation and spend time at a resort. We like to relax and lounge around the pool etc, So, the first time we went to the Jockey Club in Vegas was about 5 years ago. We got a pretty nice room-fully equipped kitchen, dining room, living room, bedroom and bath. But we weren't totally impressed with the pool etc. We were hoping for a resort stay. This really isn't the place for that. That said, LOCATION is the biggest asset to the Jockey Club: located on Las Vegas Blvd between the Bellagio and the (new) Cosmopolitan, and across the street from Planet Hollywood and Paris--the Jockey Club is PERFECT for those who want to explore Vegas. Aside from getting from the airport (a shuttle gets your a roundtrip for under $20 per person) you can walk, take the bus, or ride the monorail almost anyplace you want to go for very little money. The Jockey Club is 11 stories high, and until they built the Cosmopolitan, your room had a pretty nice view of the strip. The Cosmpolitan is 57 stories high, and the Bellagio isn't much less than that too. You will have NO VIEW whatsoever, if that is important to you. The units are being redecorated, and ours was one of the newly done ones--and I really liked it. We were comfortable there. It had everything you needed, including 2 flat screen tv's--one in the living room and the other in the bedroom. I am pretty sure all the units are the same--2 queen beds in the big bedroom and a bathroom off the bedroom. I don't think the couch makes out into a bed, but you could ask. The maids come for a daily pick up of your towels, dispose of your trash, and will make your bed. They do a mid-week cleaning, which you can schedule. They freshen up the room and put new linens on the bed.We appreciated that a lot. Bed is comfortable, maid service good, all requests we had were taken care of quickly, and all communications we had with the desk etc. were courteous and fast. BIGGEST DOWNSIDE: before the Cosmopolitan was built, you could see the Jockey Club from the street--you parked in the parking lot and walked in. Now there's really no outside entrance. It's basically engulfed by the Cosmpolitan and unless you know it's there, you won't see it. They've made access to the place and parking very hard until you've done it a couple of times. They have given the B3 level for Jockey Club members. You have to figure our which elevators go to the Jockey Club. If not, you wander around the Cosmopolitan with your suitcases until someone takes pity on you and steers you to the correct elevators . For those who are driving, you can only turn in to the Jockey Club going southbound on Las Vegas Blvd (next right after the Bellagio parking entrance). It looks like an alley, Go about 200 feet and turn left into the parking structure and go to B3. The reason I mention this is that Las Vegas Blvd, is insane, especially at night. You will have to go past the Jockey Club, turn left onto Flamingo and do an illegal u-turn (people do it) to get back onto Las Vegas Blvd. in order to turn into the Jockey Club. Make sure you are not in the right-most lane, as that's a Bellagio-turn only lane. So, if you want to \"do Vegas\" and want location---Jockey Club is great. The unit itself is great. Staff is great. Pool is ok., No restaurant, but there is a mini-market onsite. They do have shuttles to take you to the store etc . Initially finding it and then figuring out parking and getting to the correct elevator for the first couple of times is the worst. If you do exchange, they always seem to have weeks available. No problems with getting the time you need.. We had a car and spent most of our time outside of the strip area and we enjoyed our trip to Vegas.

Second, FREE access to two of the Cosmo's pools - the Bamboo and Boulevard. A short walk behind the JC, through an elevator door and, BAM, you are in the Cosmopolitan.

Initially the layout seems a little awkward and unorganized but in the end, once I figured out all the little intricacies of the location, the hotel was actually a decent place. The parking for Jockey Club members is underneath the Cosmopolitan Casino which is the first of many things the Jockey Club and the Cosmo share. The entrance to the parking garage is right off the strip. If you're going North on the Strip you have to make a U-Turn right before Bellagio which can be a little tricky if you're not used to big city driving because immediately after the U-turn, get all the way over to pull into the driveway. The elevator in the garage from level B3 is not labeled well at all. That particular elevator is the key though because it is the link between the Jockey Club and the Cosmo. The Jockey Club has two towers where you can stay. We stayed in the \"second\" or \"rear\" tower which was farthest away from the strip. It took some meandering to get to the room which was on the 11 floor \"penthouse\". There were a few places where there were stairs you'd have to lift your luggage instead of rolling it along. But our penthouse room faced North and had floor to ceiling windows with a gorgeous view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains. The room is spacious with a sectional couch, two flat screens, a walk in closet and a full kitchen. Maid service is offered daily. The time share is a little older so it only had two elevators which got very busy on the weekend meaning long waits. So busy in fact that they both broke requiring us to use the service elevator. They were repaired within the day. The pool is very small but is open 24 hours. It was more like a pool you would see at a Best Western Hotel. But if you can navigate the twists and turns to the neighboring Cosmopolitan Casino through the elevator you can access the Cosmo pool which is decadent and luxurious. The Cosmo pool is the epitome of a vegas pool experience. It's above the Strip with amazing views and plenty of \"scenery\". They did ask for a hotel key card one time and I showed my Jockey Club hotel card and was let right in. The time share does not have the restaurants, or gambling. It's simply a place to stay. You'll have to rely on the Cosmo for everything casino. But they're very new so right about now the Cosmo is the place to be. The Jockey Club is in a great location on the strip with decent walking proximity to MGM and the Mirage. And if you're looking for breakfast, or even late night post bar food, I highly recommend Planet Dailies at Planet Hollywood across the street.

While it was pretty good for the most part I did have a few complaints...1. Valet parking cost $5.00 a day because they sub out to a different company, and it only added up to $35.00 for the week it was kind of a pain when you expect free valet because everywhere else on the strip does it for free, and you would think that since you are paying for it you would get your car faster, but you would be wrong. Durring the week they only have one person working (one time it took over half an hour to get our car.). You may say well then why not self park? The answer to that is, Self parking is about half a block away and when it is 114 out and you have a 4 year old that can be a bit much. About half way through the week my mom and stepdad joined us and being the he is handicapped we figured they would have a better parking situation for him (he has disabled plates)....nope same 5 bucks for valet or self parking in the Cosmo's underground lot, so they parked in the lot and my husband drover to get them and bring them back. As for the new remodel they are doing, if I was in charge the contractor would have been fired...the bathroom counters hung halfway over the toilets in both bathrooms, and most of the doors did not fit right in the jams making them hard to open and close as well as loud (don't open these doors when others are trying to sleep) in our \"room\" (we had the 2 bedrooom) we had the master closet and master bathroom doors as well as the second bedroom door and the second or guest bathroom door...makes it hard to do anything quietly while others are sleeping. On the good side they did have free crafs for the kids from 1:30 to 5:30 and they have games and movies you can check out for free as well as free popcorn and coffee.

I was attending a trade show at the Convention center, but all the hotels closer to the convention center were either already booked or way beyond my budget. I figured that since I'd have a car and would be driving, commuting to/from the Jockey Club and LVCC wouldn't be that bad. Besides, the central strip location would come in handy after work. The Jockey Club is nestled between two major hotels. With a flood of pedestrians right after the fountain show at Bellagio, I nearly missed the turn in to the hotel premises. There was some construction going on, but nothing that impacted my being able to park while I checked in. Everything went smoothly at the check-in. I got a room upgrade for a colleague (to a view of the Bellagio fountains), the room keys, a plethora of literature about the property (it's part of a timeshare) and then the parking directions. The parking. The Jockey Club shares a garage with The Cosmopolitan and so there's a limited amount of parking spaces reserved for Jockey Club guests. The parking itself wasn't an issue--it was getting back into the Jockey Club through the proper elevators. The signage was dismal compared to the signs directing you to the Cosmo elevators. And when you finally get through the doors of the elevator to the Jockey Club, you're greeted with additional signs and barricades that kinda funnel you back to the front entry. To be fair: the walkways were always clean and I felt safe enough to walk back to the car at multiple points during the night/early morning. The room was all very standard, except for the Oreck vacuum in the walk-in closet--not sure if that was left by housekeeping. The full kitchen was a treat and it was nice to sit down to eat with actual utensils instead of plastic (cause food in Vegas can cost an arm & a leg!). And the central location Mid-Strip was fantastic for sightseeing! And while I had a car at my disposal, if you don't the Jockey Club offers a shuttle service to nearby convenience stores if you need to pick up groceries and the like. One comment: because I was in Vegas for business, I found it rather inconvenient that my wifi access was minimal (no wireless internet access) in the room. But the wifi improved when in common areas (lobby, entry) and there was also 2 computers available for use, not to mention the Timeshare Member's Area. I had a multipage document that I needed to print (12pgs) and when I mentioned this to the front desk, they said that it was okay. Not exactly the same 'business center' service that you'd get from other places, but still acceptable (and I procrastinated in the first place anyway).

I've stayed at the Jockey Club several times about a decade ago with college friends when there was nothing around the timeshare.

This past Christmas, the new Cosmopolitan opened right next door, upping Jockey Club's location value. Of course, JC has had to undergo some renovations since the early 2000s due to the space the bigger hotels took up (or bought up) but the rooms have remained the same. JC has simple and dated rooms with box tvs and even a little stereo system. But the space is clean and has everything you need and expect from a timeshare. We stayed in a two bedroom unit, which I have stayed in before, that hadn't changed one bit with the exception of having a great view of the Bellagio water show. Since the kiddos were in tow, we borrowed a couple movies and games from the activity center and I was pleased with their updated titles. Maybe they have to make up for the dated rooms. The kiddos were also excited to get popcorn (and us a cup of coffee) whenever we came back from sight seeing. The service at the activity center was always friendly. The best thing (and why I gave it the extra star) about staying at the JC is certainly the location as in Bellagio and now Cosmopolitan are right outside your door.

Although we weren't given the room with a view that we requested, overall we're satisfied with our stay in Jockey Club. The location is perfect! Right on the strip where the action is. It's set back a little bit from the strip so you don't really hear any noise. Very quiet hotel. You could easily miss the entrance if you're not familiar with the area. The parking is a little tricky too. The best thing is, as you come out of the hotel , you're next to Bellagio, across the street is Paris and Planet Hollywood.

The furniture, TV's and decorations needs to be updated however. I'm not sure if the 2nd Tower is new. Haven't seen any of the rooms there. The big plus for us is their King size bed and pillows that are so soft and just heavenly comfortable. We slept soundly every night which was very refreshing. They have daily towel exchanges and housekeeping which was excellent. The room provided us with what we needed but it's far from luxury though. There's 2 computer in the lobby for use and we printed our boarding pass with no problem. This is a timeshare property but never bothered us for a sales pitch which we appreciated.

Even better, the experience keeps improving with every visit! The addition of the Cosmopolitan immediately attached to the Jockey Club is terrific. Granted, having a parking lot there was a nice feature, too, but that was a long time ago. We suffered through the construction but the construction is completed now. The underground parking is fantastic, with extremely easy access off of Harmon Avenue directly between the Cosmopolitan and City Center. The parking underground is on B3 and the Jockey Club elevator can be hard to find at first. Once you know where it is the parking is tremendous with easy access to the Jockey Club and to the Cosmopolitan. Literally, there is a private elevator entrance to the casino. One thing I have always enjoyed is the tremendous amount of space in the Jockey Club suites. It is liek having an apartment on the Strip! It is terrific to be able to bring leftovers home from restaurants and put them in the refrigerator, as well as being able to stop at the local grocery store and grab a case of water and some snacks. I have never really cooked a big meal in Vegas, but you could with the kitchen. There are grills available on the pool deck, too, if you want to barbeque. The suites are being renovated now and the newly renovated rooms include flat screen TVs and new room decor and lighting. There is brand new furniture and all the updates are terrific. I have been in some of the hotel rooms at some of the nicer hotels and cannot believe people pay more than I do for a room a quarter of the size with none of the amenities. The location simply cannot be beat. As I mentioned, there is a direct connection to the Cosmopolitan. The Bellagio is next door, Planet Hollywood and Paris are across the street, and all 3 are within a 5 minute walk. City Center and Mote Carlo are to the south of the Cosmo and Caesars, Bally's, and Flamingo are to the north, all about a 10 minute walk. MGM, Excalibur, New York New York, Mirage, and a number of other casinos are also within walking distance. There is the possibility of having a wall view when staying at the Jockey Club due to the Cosmopolitan being directly next door. I believe these are the last suites they staff fills. I had a wall view just last week when I was there. It can be an issue with some people, but you also have to remember the value that goes along with the price and features offered. If it is a huge concern, ask yourself how important the view really is for you and how much time you will spend in the room looking out the window. If it is still an issue, it is probably best to look somewhere else for a room. There are a few other features of staying at the Jockey Club: * They have computers downstairs for use by any guests. I used the computer to print my boarding pass last trip. WiFi is available throughout and in the suites. * There is a hospitality suite where there are books, games, and DVDs to check out at no charge. They even have a popcorn machine for a night in with a movie. I have (on longer trips) decided to spend a night in to recharge my batteries and the DVDs are a nice feature. * There is a pool, fitness room, sauna, and whirlpool. The pool is shadowed by the Cosmopolitan, but the whirlpool is indoors. The fitness center is pretty good with 8-10 machines and a few cardio machines. * A limited number of passes to the Cosmopolitan pool are available by request at the front desk. * There is a shuttle to the local grocery store, but I have never used it and I do not know the schedule. There is the potential for time share guys to make offers to you, but a firm but polite \"no\" usually does the trick. If you do not want to participate there is no reason you have to do so. I do nto believe Jockey Club suites are still being sold, although I could be wrong. Again, I just love staying at the Jockey Club when in Las Vegas, which is usually at least twice a year.

We were approached in the alley by a guy that worked for another timeshare hotel, apparently the catch phrase is...\"how do you like the jockey club\" then when you begin to tell them how much it sucks they offer to put you up in their hotel for a mere \"90 minute presentation\" The concerige for the Jockey Club happened to walk out the door, noticed what was going on and a screaming and yelling match between the two insued, apparently they are well aware of the inferiorities of the Jockey Club (JC) and threatened by losing guests, we just walked away. We tried to go to the \"spa\" one day to try and maybe salvage something good from this place, we attempted to sit in the jacuzzi but the chlorine level was so high it immediately burned our eyes, we opened the door that encloses the jacuzzi to try to get some fresh air just so we could stay in the room but soon after getting in noticed our skin was either being bleached or chemically burned. (not sure which) We then went to the pool which was cold (mind you the JC is surrounded by tall buildings, or as they like to say \"nestled\" and barely see's the light of day. The liner of the pool was blue, but the bottom was brown, pretty sure it wasn't made that way, I have seen nicer pools at a holiday inn. The \"view\" of the Bellagio they tout is only obtained from the top floors on one side of course and I suspect only reserved for those who are most likely to purchase a timeshare from this dump, otherwise you're view is of a wall or the \"walkway to the strip\"...a dark alley. I'm guessing I got the room I got because I am already a timeshare owner and I declined to attended the \"owners meeting\" for those of you not familiar, thats where they try to get you to buy another timeshare or upgrade the one you have. The JC should have taken the offer from The Cosmoplitan so they could have been torn it down and made better use of the space.", "Date": "March 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Daytona Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cbest place on the strip!\u201d", "Author": "blackthornsx9x", "ReviewID": "UR97729043", "Content": "please dont let others past experience deter you from traveling here .I loved it it was beautiful and big ,and fun of fun and excitment right in the middle of everything :) i walked everywhere i kinda felt like a little kid again :) except this time i could drink and gamble hahah . plus there is a good site see's around there area im an out doors girl and man was i happy .", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon", "Title": "\u201cAverage price, older rooms, furnishings.Great location\u201d", "Author": "signeug1", "ReviewID": "UR94679805", "Content": "Very good service, Lousy view except north facing rooms (Bellagio Fountains) New Cosmopolitan Casino next door Very nice!", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location without the frills\u201d", "Author": "iluvsanfran", "ReviewID": "UR94398792", "Content": "This is not your typical Vegas experience.

When we 1st walked into the room i noticed something on the floor under the dining room table, it was a dirty pillowcase. I went to put the dirty pillowcase in the front closet where I had noticed a large laundry bag. Upon closer inspection, it was a bag of laundered towels, and the top 1/3 were still wet from the laundry and where going to sit there for a week and mildew for the next tenant. The flyer for the unit said washer/dryer, so we packed for 3 days. There was no washer/dryer IN the unit, it is in the building. The flyer also said tv, notice I said tv, not tv's. In a 2 bdr (self described luxury unit) unit there was 1 20-inch TV in the living room. It has been a very long time since we have been anywhere that didn't have tv in master suite. The unit was DIRTY. I picked up dish towel hanging on stove to dry my hands and on the backside was old food stuck to towel. All of the floors were dirty with actual pieces of trash in some corners. The master bath tub had the broken handle laying in the bottom of the dirty tub and the toilet was really bad! I used the 2nd bath and left this one to the hubby. One panel of the wall mirror in the dining room was so dirty with hand prints that I couldn't guess the last time it had been cleaned. The extra blanket in the 2nd bdr was laying on the floor of the closet in a heap. The kitchen was very poorly equipped. There is 1 supposedly sharp knife that wouldn't peel a cucumber or slice a tomato. We went to walmart and bought 2 knives so we could eat the steaks we were cooking for dinner. Very limited pans and bowls. The toaster was full of old crumbs and didn't work unless you held down the button the whole time. Another issue was that our keys would not stay activated. Everyday, sometimes 2x a day, our keys would stop working and we would have to go to security to request replacements. The replacements were not made immediatley so if you were going in and out, security had to take you up and let you in while you were waiting for keys.

She cons you into signing up for a timeshare presentation without telling you it is a timeshare presentation. In fact here words were \"they are all sold out, they don't have anything to sell you\". They offer you show tickets and a free 3 night stay at another resort. Needless to say, we got suckered into the presentation but of course did not buy. All the show tickets they gave us were not well known shows and all required a purchase. They even gave us expired tickets. The 3 night stay they offered required ANOTHER timeshare presentation to be attended and you had to pay $99 up front and was not refundable if you didn't attend the presentation. I have been to other timeshare presentations and were given nice, tangible gifts in exchange for my time. All the gifts they gave us went in the trash. The place itself is clean but we couldn't even enjoy the pool because of all the construction going on around it. They had a huge net hanging high above the pool to catch all the debris falling. This cut off all the sunlight that one usually enjoys while using a pool! They don't even offer laundry bags for your dirty laundry.

The staff quickly complied and we were assigned to the top floor. No view, but the quiet was worth the trade off. With the exception of the concierge (who seems clueless), the staff were friendly and efficient. The location is perfect, right in the center of the strip. The construction is a mild annoyance, but didn't really affect us. The Jockey Club is a great value.

I read through many of the reviews posted here and elsewhere online and was really kind of apprehensive about booking this hotel, but I waited until the last minute to join some friends for a quick weekend getaway and needed a room, so I decided to go for it... Let me tell you, it was great! I booked the same day I was to travel, and got the room for about 80 bucks a night. There is a lot of construction going on, which might make the hotel entrance hard to spot if you are trying to find it on your own, but since I took a taxi from the airport, this was not an issue for me. Check-in went smoothly, but I was not able to get one of the rooms with a view of the Bellagio. But the room itself was excellent! I have been to Vegas many times and have stayed at a few of the strip hotels, and most of the time it feels like you're paying hundreds of dollars to stay at a dressed up Best Western. The rooms in the Jockey Club are more like apartments! You get a full kitchen (dishwasher, oven, stove, full size fridge, cups/plates/cooking utensils) a living room with a sofa/loveseat, a dining area, a large bathroom, walk-in closet with iron/ironing board, a king size bed, two TVs (not flat screen), and a stereo. The sofa was also a pull out bed. There was easily enough room for 4-6 people in a room. The room was immaculate. It actually looked brand new, as if I was the first person to stay there. There was no view, but honestly, how long are you going to spend gazing out of the window or watching TV in your room when you come to Vegas? I heard NO construction noise all weekend. The hotel is RIGHT on the Strip, across from Planet Hollywood and next door to Bellagio. If I had anything negative to say, it would be really nitpicky. The layout of the hotel I saw mentioned in other reviews is not that much of a problem. You go up to the second floor on one elevator, go about 50 feet down a hallway, and up TEN steps to get to the other tower. No worse than trying to navigate through a casino if your ask me. It is kind of hard to catch taxis at the hotel, I found it quicker to just go to the Bellagio or PH and get in their taxi line, but the valet drivers got me a ride to the airport when I checked out in a Town Car. Nice! The pool is kind of small, if you care about that kind of thing. I didn't. I didn't bring my computer, so I don't know about internet in the rooms, but they have free computers with internet down in the lobby. There's also a store with just about anything you may have forgotten (no hard liquor though, bring your own!) the prices are the same as ou find anywhere else on the Strip, so if you want lower prices rather than convenience, better ride out to a corner store out in town. All told, this is a GREAT place to stay for the money, and I will definitely be back. If you want to impress other people with how much you paid for your hotel room, go to the Wynn or Encore. If you come to Vegas to gamble/party/eat/have fun and need a large, comfortable place to stay, look no further.", "Date": "June 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location\u201d", "Author": "islelvr", "ReviewID": "UR31230078", "Content": "I have stayed in Las Vegas at several other time share exchange locations.

Plenty of room in the 2 bedroom, bathrooms were fair size and kitchen had all that I needed for breakfast and snacks.

PFChangs is across the Strip from the Jockey club along with Planet Hollywood casino and shops. Bellagio is next door. Paris, Bally's, Ceasar's and Monte Carlo are close walks.

After reading many reviews on The Jockey Club I called ahead and requested a room with a view of the fountains and were told it is on a first come first serve basis.

They would get us fresh towels, but did not bother to change the over flowing trash can. Overall a decent place to stay (especially since ours only cost us our exchange fee) and I would stay again. As for the construction we only heard it a few days, but we were there over a holiday week. It seeemed to start about 8AM and go until maybe 8PM. Also, we saw a few shows. Hypnosis show - Mesmerized with Marc Sarvard at the V theatre at Planet Hollywood. Great show! Very funny! After seeing mesmerized and liking it so much we decided to see the dirty hypnosis, Unleashed, show at Krave at Planet Hollywood. Not near as good as the Mesmerized. It seemed like a bad knockoff of Mesmerized. Marc Sarvard puts on way better show that I would see again! Cique de Soleil - Mystere at Treasure Island. Great show. Amazed at the the things these people could do. Expensive, but worth it. I would pay the 200+ over again. Steve Wyrick Magic Show - Terrible. This guy is very cocky and his tricks are not very good. Don't waste your money! Only reason you might want to go is if you have a 5 year old, maybe he/she might be impressed with the show. Mac King Comedy/Magic Show at Harrahs. I read the show was pretty good, so I went to Harrahs to get tickets and they gave me free ones. You actually have to pay $10/ticket, but get a free alcoholic beverage with each ticket.

We exchanged our timeshare through Interval International and checked in the Wednesday before July 4th. The exchange was straightforward, no issues with our check in; the luggage was up to our room within minutes and the valet parking was quick. This hotel has 2 buildings with the pool area in between. As others have said, this hotel is in the midst of a large amount of construction; 2 hotels are being built around the 2 Jockey Club buildings. One of the construction sites (for the Cosmopolitan hotel) has an office on the 2nd floor of back building, the Derby tower. As suggested in other reviews, we asked for a room facing the Bellagio hotel. But being in the back building, the main view from room 754 is of the Bellagio parking structure, so our views of the strip and the Bellagio fountains were only partial. The construction noise is prominent, for us we notice the noise not in the evenings, but the mornings. At 5:30 am every morning (except July 4th and Sunday), a truck came in and dropped off a construction dumpster and the noise began. We also noticed a lot of noise coming from our upstairs neighbor but not from other rooms on our floor. So if you are looking for a peaceful night\u2019s sleep, this is not the hotel for you. The other effect of the construction is the pool covering; a double netting anchored with 4 or 5 very large posts (think a circus big top) and a dust of construction debris litters everything, including the pool water and pool loungers. I think the staff should do a better job of keeping the pool area cleaner and left comments on our review card at check out. The pool tiles were also filthy and the pool looked like it needed to be vacuumed more often. Pool side towels were plentiful and chilled bottled water was provided daily. The pool deck also has a pool table, ping pong table, dart board and kids sized basketball game. All the equipment was available for complementary check out on the first floor on the Ascot Tower in the hospitality room. Free popcorn, coffee and water was also available throughout the day in the hospitality room, along with a wide selection of movies (we only looked at the kids movies) and games available for use. The location of this hotel is perfectly situated on the strip and the small size made getting in and out of the hotel much easier than I would imagine guests of the mega resorts have. Valet parking is mandatory; they say due to the construction. The valets were quick and we only waited a few minutes each time to get our car. Only on July 4th when we came back to the hotel late, did we have to park across the street at the Planet Hollywood hotel parking structure (for no additional fee). A shuttle runs between the Jockey Club and the Planet Hollywood parking structure but stops at Midnight. We came to visit Las Vegas because we were visiting family over July 4th and because we live within driving distance. There is too much sexually explicit advertising for my taste and I was uncomfortable with my children in this situation, so I would not recommend Vegas a family destination (unless you were staying off the strip and did not bring your children to the strip.)", "Date": "July 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Vacation!

We booked a 2 bdrm/2 bath penthouse suite thru lasvegasrental.org, and for 5 girls, there was plenty of room for everyone. The things I liked: 1. CLEANLINESS - It was clean and the furniture/decor seemed updated. Even the bathrooms looked like they were recently remodeled. 2. THE VIEW - We had a direct view of the Bellagio water show everyday and everynight. From the master bedroom, since it was a corner unit with all windows, we had both a view of the Bellagio water show as well as the Vegas strip. We truly felt like \"high rollers\" w/out the empty pockets! 3. PRIVACY - There is a one-time cleaning fee, and you don't get the daily maid service like you would in the hotels; but I thought that was better since we were only there for 3 nights. We could leave our personal, valuable belongings exposed w/out worry that there would be strangers going through our rooms. 6. AMENITIES - The kitchen was fully stocked from dishwashing liquid, plateware/silverware, wine bottle opener, to extra plastic bags. The bathroom was fully stocked w/more than enough towels and Bath & Body soaps, lotions, shampoos & conditioners. We had 5 girls who each took showers everyday and went through a new towel each time, yet there were still new, unused towels leftover by the time we checked out. 6. PARKING - Free valet parking all day everyday. Not to mention, the valet guys were all very professional, sincere, and quick to get your car. The service was 5 star!!! 7. LOCATION - Right off the strip, next to Bellagio, across from the mall... everything you need is within walking distance... what more could 5 girls ask for? Problems... I didn't really see any problems that were intolerable. I do understand the other reviews and their complaints about the noise & construction, and it's true that there is some huge billion $ project being built around the hotel, but there's construction everywhere in Vegas right about now. It did look like a war zone around the hotel as you pull into the front lobby, but don't be so quick to judge. During the 4 days we stayed there (Fri-Mon), I was never bothered by the noise or construction. Not to say that I didn't hear anything, I did! But the noise was not anything so big that turning on the volume of the TV or CD couldn't fix. In fact, every night I slept with one window in the livingroom open, and had no issues falling asleep or staying asleep. Granted, we partied every night we were there, but... isn't that WHY you would go to Vegas in the first place??? Perhaps most of the complaints are coming from those who stayed in rooms that were not on the Bellagio side of the building. I do believe there was more construction going on at the opposite side of where we stayed. We also stayed in a penthouse suite on the 11th floor, which I believe is their top most floor, so the location was well above and farther away from the construction noise. All in all, ABSOLUTELY I would stay there again, but I would ONLY book a penthouse suite on the Bellagio side since my experience was positive with them. I would suggest that if you plan to stay here, ask whoever you are booking through to be honest with you about the situation with the construction. Ask them which floor you'll be on, which side of the building is your room, and whether there are any cranes and construction obstructing your view. If you can book the penthouse on the 11th floor, that's going to be your best bet :)", "Date": "December 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlottetown, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDon't rule out the Jockey Club!\u201d", "Author": "LUVSTOGO", "ReviewID": "UR10755611", "Content": "I feel the need to add my two cents worth on the Jockey Club. I stayed at the Jockey Club Oct 26 through 29, 2007 (we were three retired ladies, all with extensive travel experience). Given a number of reviews, we were somewhat concerned about the construction issue, and while in the throes of decision making, I spoke directly to a lady at the JC and staff at the Las Vegas Tourist Bureau. The people I spoke to were quite open about the issue and the potential for noise, but also pointed out that individual experiences have apparently been quite different, with some happy customers and some unhappy. Because our priorities were location, convenience (having kitchen facilites so we could breakfast in), and space (three in a room, and not wanting to be tripping over one another), we decided to take a chance (we were going to Vegas, after all!). We booked through the LVTB. We were in Room 1018, right beside the elevator, and facing the construction and the Monte Carlo Hotel. Rooms on the north side, where we had hoped to be, face the fountains at Bellagio. While our view was not impressive ( a number of buildings going up, and I counted over forty porta-potties, which was pretty exciting!), never once were we bothered by noise. Heavy equipment was operating below us, cranes were moving stuff, and men were laying steel below and to the right of our room. We heard the occasional banging (once that I remember) and a few beeps, but honestly, nothing bothersome.There was no work except at ground level from late Saturday pm until Monday morning. Having said all of this, it was not difficult to see that if we had been in a different room, at a different time, the noise could have been a real issue. The suite itself was spacious (large bedroom with two queen beds, double walk-in closet and full bath off bedroom, another closet and half bath off hallway, large livingroom with queen hide-a-bed, dining set, and fully equipped kitchen. It was not luxurious, but had been recently refurbished, and was clean and comfortable. Beds were great, pillows were awesome, hide-a-bed was OK. Housekeeping was OK (we didn't require much); we had lots of towels, etc.; coffee and tea were supplied. Front desk staff were pleasant and helpful, and our one and only wake-up call came right on time. Location was perfect - right beside Bellagio, across from Planet Hollywood, close to the street, with a bus stop right in front (we used the Deuce bus every day). Several times one or the other of us returned to the JC alone late at night, and felt safe doing so (lots of foot traffic, decent lighting, always staff at the side entrance, etc). The little market on the ground floor was pricey, but had more variety than the ABC store in the mall across the street (where prices were similar), and suited our needs. There was no safe in the suite, but they have bank style safety deposit boxes at the front desk -- accessible 24 hours, and very secure. Luggage storage (checkout was at 11:00, but we had a late flight) was also convenient and secure. All in all, our experience with the JC was great.

The Jockey Club is literally surrounded by the new resort and the construction proves it!

The bad: You are surrounded by construction! We stayed in room 608, a two bedroom/two bath, and could have reached out the master bedroom window and high-fived the construction workers. Yes, they really were that close. Construction (jack hammers, welding, etc.) starts at 6am on all days except Sunday. Over this past weekend (Oct 20-21) they were pouring cement 24/7. Granted, when we meet in Vegas it's to have fun and not relax in our room but after a night of fun and rolling in at all hours, being jolted awake at 6am was not ideal. The pool is heated and, based on past experiences, is a nice place to spend a few hours. Now a large tarp covers the pool area to prevent any construction materials from falling into it or on you!

(the time my two boys ages 2 and 1 were already asleep) construction workers started the construction in the parking lot area. It was OK but at times rather loud even on the 9th floor. Then the next morning around 10 o'clock they started working on the condo next door. They took everything out (kitchen cabinets, rug...) and that was noisy so we just left for the day. I guess this place is owned by private owners as well so they were doing some upgrading. Location was great! You can just walk down the strip. It was nice to have a kitchen area. They have valet parking only. They have DSL service on the first floor of every tower. You can visit the hospitality room and have some free popcorn, coffee, two free movie rentals and board games to check out. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I have no complaints besides the noise factor. I guess it's unavoidable!?@ They are doing construction on the North side (parking lot), South Side (whole new hotel I think it's Trump Towers) and across at the Aladdin.

We have previously stayed at other timeshares off the strip, as well as the Stratosphere, and this year decided to be a little \"closer\" to the action and hustle of the Las Vegas Strip. But it sits back off the street and has a narrow driveway leading up to it. Even the signage is difficult to see from the strip and is easy to miss. There is a fenced sidewalk for those walking, I guess so you don't walk on the driveway and run the risk of getting run over. There is a shuttle bus, and I do not know if it goes anywhere besides the Aladdin. Every time we asked for a ride, we were told the bus only goes to the Aladdin (which is across the street, and under construction itselft to become a Planet Hollywood). The Jockey consists of 2 buildings connected by a center passageway. They have a pool, exercise room, hot tub, and even free computers (when checking email is a must). We stayed in the 2nd building farthest from the street, and although on the 8th floor, it was difficult to see the Bellagio water show that others have commented on. Parking is valet only, and the valet post is at the first building - meaning you have to get out and walk up a hill to the 2nd building. Not so great when in heels and your feet are throbing! Overall, the room was decent. For 5 women, we were each able to carve out a little space for luggage and things. We did venture to a Super Wal-Mart to purchase food for cooking - gotta save money whenever possible. We are not big on staying in a room all day, as we like to hang out, gamble, and shop (not in that order), so overall we were pleased with the overall appearance of the room. We did read from previous posts that there was construction on one side, so we were sure to ask for a room on the Bellagio side. What we were not informed of is that there is construction going on within the hotel, and they were renovating the room directly above us. Not a problem, except they started working at 7:30 in the morning. This occured twice, and although we complained, nothing was done. I am sure they were not sold out, so why they would give us a room below one that is under construction is beyond me. It literally sounded like the ceiling was going to cave in on top of us - that's how loud they were. We were miserable and pissed - not a good combination for 5 women trying to vacation.

I'm 25, drive an Audi, and I am self-employed. I live in San Diego. My stay at Jockey Club was for a bachelor party. The bachelorette party stayed at Signature at MGM, which is what I base my opinion of Jockey Club on. AREA: To start, Jockey club is about 100 yards off the strip, directly south of Bellagio. The drive way into the place is hard to deal with. 2 cab drivers told us they didn't know if they could get there, and 2 others told us they didn't even know where it was. One driver offered to drop us at Bellagio, which is about a 300 yard walk to Jockey Club. HOTEL/LOBBY: The lobby is in one tower and our room was in another. Navigating from the lobby to our room was challenging even with a map. Valet service was decent, and I found nothing wrong with my car after a weekend. ROOM: The room was acceptably large, had an old fridge, stove, cupboards, etc. There were a few holes in the carpet and some stains, but not too bad. There was an L shaped couch in the living area, which was large enough to sleep 2 if necessary. The room was completely free of smoke smell which was probably the most appealing part of it. It also had a huge walk-in closet which could come in handy for a longer stay, or for sleeping another 2 people (I'm talking to the college party people). Our room on the 9th floor was one that looked over the Bellagio fountains, but there are trees blocking most of the show from that vantage point. The fountains actually reached higher than our room at some points, which was pretty cool. Otherwise, the view was nothing special. BATHROOM: The shower had very little pressure and a slightly grimmy tub. The non-slip strips were coming unglued, but thats not a biggie. OVERALL ==================== PROS: Big room, big closet, large couch. Nice to have a fridge. Would be good for college party people with large groups (there were even extra blankets and pillows in the closet). Comfy couch for sleeping (not sure if it was pull out). CONS: Akwardly located and positioned, lobby is miles from some rooms. Small TV. A/C was loud. Not even CLOSE to as nice as Signature at MGM. CONCLUSION: If you are considering staying at Jockey Club, really, look into Signature at MGM first. We could have stayed at either place for the same price (about $200 a night), but we chose wrong. I will likely stay at Signature every time I visit Vegas...its that nice!", "Date": "March 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "KittyJul", "ReviewID": "UR7178539", "Content": "I exchanged my timeshare to stay at the Jockey Club.

But the prices or the availability of rooms right in the heart of the strip led me to take the chance. I certainly was glad I did! The company was running a special of $216 for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday nights--TOTAL!!! Now folks, that was going to be the cost of one night at the neighbors, if you could get the days you wanted. Yes, there is construction going on right next door, and our view looking down was a very interesting major hole the size of my little home town. We were on the sixth floor facing the construction. To our surprise, though, the construction was closed for the weekend. They started up late Sunday evening, but the noise was minimal. I am a light sleeper and it certainly didn't bother me. With a little white noise from the air conditioner, I slept like a baby. And the view? Well, at night laying in the bed, our view was that gorgeous Vegas neon! MGM Grand green, Polo Towers purple, and all the reds and yellows down on the street. It was beautiful! True, the entrance to the Jockey Club is not all fancied up right now. But the walkway to the entrance from the street is easy to find, fenced off from the drive, clean, and very, very well lit at night. There is a shuttle stop right at the end of the walk. True, the regular units are not over-large. We had a king-size bed with double doors to close it off from the living room/kitchen, unit 624 in the Ascot tower. The furnishings were all clean and very well-maintained. The carpet was quite clean and not at all worn. The kitchen had everything you expect, and the lovely dining area was set and ready for a meal. We like very much to fix our own coffee and a little breakfast, and to have snacks or light meals in the room instead of having to eat out every time we get a little hungry. This was perfect. Granted, the unit wasn't huge, but it certainly suited our needs. If you had a couple of kids with you, sleeping on the sleeper sofa, I think there would still be enough space that it would be okay--two TV's, games and movies available in the hospitality room, and so on. A nice service the JC offers is a shuttle from there across the street to the Aladdin taxi station. Instead of calling a taxi when we went to dinner/show, we took the shuttle and got a taxi from there. Same for the airport, only we took an airport shuttle from there instead of a taxi. Now, the Aladdin is just across the street, but believe me, you don't want to be wagging your luggage through 4 or 6 lanes of traffic, :-). We were always able to get the shuttle within a few minutes, and the folks working that area were very helpful. Yes, we could have called a taxi to come to the JC, but it would have taken at least 30 minutes, and it was really easy to take the shuttle across the street. The mini-mart downstairs was just that--a mini-mart. The prices were higher than you would find in a regular grocery, but come on, what do you expect? If you are staying a week, there is a grocery shuttle. Everything we bought was current, and Lupe at the check-out was a font of information. The bed was scrumptious! I have stayed in some very high-end places that didn't have a bed half a comfy. And it must be nearly new. If you have to have a casino within a minute of your room, this is not the place for you. The closest good-ole-boy casino is the Barbary Coast on the corner of the block. Of course the Bellagio is right next door, but it isn't one of those quickie drop a few coins in the slots kind of place. (By the way, the Barbary Coast has $5 craps tables during the daytime.) Real Plus: Non-smoking building; fantastic pillow-top bed and nice linens; lots of towels; walk-in closet; very helpful and friendly staff; computer/printer access; public areas clean and well-maintained; fast elevators; no casino to schlep your bags through; very private feeling; good central climate control system; responsive house-keeping staff; did I mention NON-SMOKING building; spang dab in the middle of the strip, right next to the Bellagio. Real Minus: I've got to say it, the bathroom vanity is just too small; no view from the living room, only the bedroom; I can't think of any others.

The Jockey Club is not a Hotel/Casino, but a timeshare that has some rooms available to rent for non-timeshare owners, too.

From what I heard from another guest, these rooms should not be your first choice, and are giving the Jockey Club Timeshare Condos a bad rap. These 30 or so units that aren\u2019t a part of the timeshare condos are not furnished as well as the timeshare condos, are not kept up to date as far as mattresses, are not as clean, and the curtains in these rooms are also ripped. Now, when it comes to the Jockey Club Timeshare Condos they were fabulous, and even though that guest checking in was for the 30 or so units operated by the Tourist Bureau, the Jockey Club Timeshare Condos staff handled that guest with concern and integrity just like one of their guests checking into a timeshare condo. There is construction going on inside and outside of the Jockey Club, but from what I could tell, there is also construction going on all over Las Vegas. The great thing about this construction is, when it\u2019s finished, I heard from other guests the Jockey Club Timeshare Condos will have a luxury hotel and casino right next door (opposite side of the Bellagio which is on the other side of the Jockey Club) where Jockey Club guests can access this new hotel from the Jockey Club. The noise from the construction wasn\u2019t too bad. The fact that we had a very roomy condo with a full kitchen, stocked with utensils, pots pans, a living room, DVD player, separate bedroom with a comfortable mattress, a great view of the Strip, made it well worth it.

My kids had a great time at the pool, and I looked at the weight/workout room, and think I even lost a pound or two. We were right on the Strip, within walking distance to all the great casinos, and the Fountain Show at the Bellagio right next door was a huge hit.

You get a condominium right there in the middle of the strip, and can get to your favorite casino with no trouble or time.

The unit was clean, modern, equipped with 2 25 inch tv's, 2 dvd players, stereo, and free dvd's (2 a night from their library downstairs).

The bedroom had a kingsized bed with comfortable mattress, walk in closet, and immaculate bathroom. I read that the elevators were slow, not the case.

The construction is ongoing, they were just starting to pour concrete on one part and still digging on another side. I was told by a regular that a month ago it was noisier.

We had decided before we got there that if it lived up to its reports we would check out and pay to go in one of the strip hotels. However, when we arrived we asked to be put on the side of the hotel away from the noise. We ended up with a huge suite overlooking the Bellagio on the 9th floor. We went to bed late and got up early. We had ear plugs ready anyway, asmy husband is a snorer! so I can honestly say in the week we were there we weren't affected by noise in our room. It was a different matter by the pool. Luckily it wasn't a sunbathing holiday for us and we had little time for pool relaxation, but the time we did sit by the pool was an experience not one to be repeated. If you have an Ipod and can listen to some music you will be ok, the pool is clean and refreshing and there are comfotable beds to lie on, mostly empty because of the noise. Overcrowding wouldn't ever be a problem here! The suite was exceptional, if we wanted to we could have cooked a 3 course dinner for ourselves every night. The kitchen was very well equipped. The dining room table already set when we arrived. It was so welcoming. We had clean towels and maid service every day as we wanted. You can leave a Do not disturb sign out if you don't want the housekeeper coming in. The comfort in the room was like home, lovely plump sofa, big TV in bedroom and lounge, sound system, although we didn't have time to bother. The bed was so big and comfy, good pillows, alarm clock, walk in wadrobe, fab bathroom with new soaps, shampoos, conditioner everday. A wonderful view over the Bellagio fountains and the Eiffel Tower at Hotel Paris. The staff were friendly, as were the other guests. Everyone seemed determined to respect everyone elses space, maybe because of the chaos outside! the bellhops and valets were great guys especially. If you want a taxi you need to walk around to the Bellagio, takes 3 mins to get there. There is a little shop in the club, adequate for essentials. Although if you hire a car and plan to drive out of town anywhere I'd advise getting a decent map from somewhere else other than the shop on sight. The club is in a great position for walking to most of the strip hotels. Circus Circus was a little too far in the heat, but we walked regularly down to the Venetian and Mirage. 15-20 min walk. On the other side we walked to Mandalay Bay, Luxor and that group. Again no more than 15-20 min brisk walk. If possible, I'd advise walking, as a foreigner you get so much atmosphere from being on the street. Its crowded( in August ) and noisy, but people were polite and queued and we loved the sights and smells. Some hotels even pump fragrance out ! Back to the Jockey Club, if you can forget the outside, interior corridors and make sure you get a room facing the Bellagio then its a perfect place to stay. Comfort, clean, space and good service.

Understandable as I'm sure the massive construction project going on to the south drives alot of folks away. Rented a car after arriving at the airport. Nearly impossible to find the hotel at night as the sign on top from the south was not lit. Nor was the small sign out front lit. Found the place only by the grace of God and step by step directions provided by my daughter via cell phone. Approach from the north going south and turn after the lakes of Bellagio. Drive slow and live with the honks and you'll find the little,hidden drive to the back of the place where you will drop your car off to a valet. There is no parking lot. Valet service is free and cars are parked at the Aladin. You enter the place through a makeshift rear entrance as the original enttrance on the southside is a construction zone. Our booking, though made weeks in advance found us with a room on the fith floor and facing the construction project. These guy work 24 hours! They also do not disconnect the back-up alarms on the construction equipment at night. So we had our rest punctuated throughout the night by the constant din of beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep....you get the point. The midnight shift is made up of a small crew of welders. The whole crew arrives and fires up the big stuff at 5:30 AM. Why oh why could the staff not place guests on the southern side of the complex? It was entertaining though when at another construction site next door across the road broke out the TNT to make digging easier. I could feel the spirit of dead mobsters who may have kept rooms here to enjoy their second lives away from home with their \"other women\". Dig the seventies? You'll be right in your element in your room. Where'd they park my Gremlin? This place needs an update! STAT! The pool was acceptable. The spa was interesting when some Mexicans in their underwear joined us. We left, never to venture back. Felt like I was sitting in their washing machine. Also the all the crane booms \"parked\" around the second story outdoor pool was less then desirable to look at. On the plus side, the complimentary free computers in the lobby were sweet. Very fast connections and convieniance. I've paid up to $9.00 for 15 minutes use at other places. The little store next to the front desk offers enough products to make dining a little more affordable during your stay. The valet service was prompt,friendly and considerate.

Everything that was said in these 2 other reviews is correct. My husband and I stayed at the Jockey Club the nights of Sept. 15 and 16. We had made our reservations through the Las Vegas Visitors Bureau, speaking to a very pleasant woman who assured me that it was a nice facility. Well, let me itemize the good and the bad. Good: 1) Location. Right next to the Bellagio, across from the Aladdin and Paris on the mid-strip. You could not ask for a more convenient location. 2) View. Fantastic. We had room 928, which was on the north side of the Ascot tower, facing the Bellagio. We could see the beautiful Bellagio fountain show from all the rooms, and had a great view of the Eiffel Tower at the Paris casino. 3) Shampoos and soaps. 4) Clean. 5) Free parking. Bad: 1) Furnishings. Mattresses were thin and cheap to begin with, and very old to boot. You would roll to the center of all three queen -size beds and could feel the springs poking out in several places. We asked for a change of rooms due to the mattresses, but were told that it was not possible. The sheets and blankets were thin, cheap and rough (but clean). The cleanliness of the bedspread was very questionable (cheap polyester \u2013 felt kind of greasy). The remaining furniture was very worn and outdated. The carpet in this room was clean but the cheap plastic plants were very dusty. A couple of chairs had broken arms. 2) Bathrooms. Bathroom was clean, but fixtures were corroded and heavy with lime deposits. Water pressure was very poor. 3) Kitchen cabinets. They were just rough-cut plywood door fronts, with a thin coat of paint. Fixtures were really old. I am glad we were not there long enough to have to rely on the cooking facilities. I saw no roaches. I do think the cleaning staff did as good of a job as they could with the old and outdated appliances, furniture and bathroom facilities and fixtures. 4) Parking lot. Although the parking was free, it was a very dark area, full of pot holes and construction, and a little scary to walk through at night. When we got there late on a Thursday evening, the front desk had no record of our reservation. I did have a confirmation number, and after the clerk called the Las Vegas Visitors Bureau the LVVB faxed a copy of our reservation over and the clerk (I think her name was Hanna) gave us a two-bedroom unit for the one-bedroom price, which we had reserved. Hanna was very nice, but we never saw her again during our stay. The clerk at the front desk on Friday morning was not very helpful or nice. I would have hated to see the original unit, if the two-bedroom one was an upgrade! All in all, do not stay here if you are looking for a nice, relaxing place to stay on your Las Vegas vacation. Or, try to rent a unit from the timeshare company. DO NOT make a reservation through the Visitors Bureau! But if your back can stand an awful mattress and box springs and all you need is a place to crash for a night on your way through Las Vegas this might be the place for you. I have attached a scan of the Jockey Club layout. Also attached are a couple of photos of the view from room 928 (the view and location were the Jockey Club\u2019s best features).

Las Vegas Visitors Bureau side of the Jockey Club is barely habitable. Be very, very careful when you book this hotel. Make sure that you ask who actually owns the hotel suite you will stay in. If its the Visitors Bureau - don't do it! I believe that if you book directly off the internet at Expedia, Travelocity, etc... it is always a Las Vegas Visitors Bureau suite, so buyer beware online. I can't warn you enough! Don't stay here if you want a good trip to Vegas.", "Date": "September 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit", "Title": "\u201cCannot be beat\u201d", "Author": "emailman1", "ReviewID": "UR3847957", "Content": "I stayed there for $89 for the week with a timeshare. The price obviously cannot be beat for a week. The location was excellent. The pool was a little small, but we enjoyed it. The 1 bedroom was very spacious for me and my wife and 2 of our friends. Checkin was fast, maid service was good. As others have mentioned, it was nice and quiet there due to no casino, and that came in handy as we were going to sleep around 4 or 5 in the morning. They are going to build the Cosmopolitan right around the JC, and I am happy about it, because I will stay there next time I go to LV. I do not know what the prices for the \"hotel\" rental part of the JC, but if you can trade to the JC, I recommend it. The only bad thing was I did not win this trip.

They provided us with a taxi service from the front door to the airport - which was much appreciated. Even though you can walk around to the Bellagio and get a ride from there, we spared ourselves the heat and stayed in the A/C until our ride arrived. You'll be a little taken back with the fact that the facility is located in a parking lot when everyone else has filled their available space with greenery.

Since my winning bid was $7 (plus taxes and fees), it was a real steal. Although it is a timeshare, I never was bothered to submit to a pitch. It is an older, but fairly well maintained property. It goes back to the 1970s, when Frank Sinatra and the \"Rat Pack\" frequented there. My apartment was on the eighth floor on south side of the far building, facing a large parking lot, with the Monte Carlo in the distance. The view from the other side of the building is the Bellagio, which is next door, and across Las Vegas Blvd. was the entrance to Desert Passage at the Alladin. First, my complaints. Like the casino hotels on the Strip, there is a hike from the Strip to the lobby, and another hike to my room. I was locked out of my room near midnight one evening (the card key was changed), but the maintenance man was very conscientious in helping me out and refused a tip. Tour and shuttle buses tend to stop at the Jockey Club last, in part because there is no immediate crossover of Las Vegas Blvd. The cable connection for the TV in the living room was not secure, so I wound up using the second TV in the bedroom (fortunately, there were a couple of chairs and a small table in the bedroom). However, compensating for this, is that I doubt that one can get a one bedroom suite (or perhaps two bedrooms) in such a prime location at a lower price. There is a convenience store in the lobby which is better stocked than nearby stores such as Walgreen's, CVS, and one in the Desert Passage. Near the lobby, there are two free computers with high-speed internet connections for time-share owners and their guests. If you are not planning to prepare all your meals in your well stocked kitchen, my suggestion would be to go to the nearby Paris Casino, which has several good (French-style) restaurants at moderate prices. The MGM-Grand has purchased the nearby Boardwalk Casino and has plans to tear it down and build one continuous resort and urban community between the Bellagio and the Monte Carlo. If the Jockey Club remains in place, it will become even more desirable. If the Jockey Cub doesn't survive this development, you don't have much time to enjoy this bit of Las Vegas history at a moderate price.", "Date": "December 11, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Jockey Club", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d91866-Reviews-Jockey_Club-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$78 - $183*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3700 Las Vegas Boulevard South</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NV</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">89109</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515821", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/63/bd/57/bedroom.jpg"}}
