The booking process was very easy - I made a call to the hotel manager, who was negotiable on price. I was able to make specific requests via email, which were honored as promised. I was met at the airport by John, the hotel guest ambassador who is Australian. The hotel had arranged for me to be met of the aeroplane by an English speaking Chinese airport person who helped me to collect my bag and to go out via the VIP exit to meet the car and the hotel guest ambassador. At the hotel I was met by my own personal valet assigned by John, the guest ambassador. Elaina was excellent. She took care of all my business related and personal requests while staying at the hotel. I can't speak highly enough about the professionalism shown by all staff. The hotel prides itself on service, and the staff are well trained. Everyone is eager to please. The hotel is close to Tiannamen Square, which makes sight seeing easy. Elaina had arranged for me to take two days worth of sight seeing which also worked out very well, in addition to the business aspects of my trip. I was able to see the main sights within Beijing that I wanted to see. I am a very discerning traveller, but can only speak highly of this hotel and its staff.", "Date": "Jan 3, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR228174960", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Traveller124"}, {"Content": "Plush! This is a really plush hotel, which is great, if plush is your kind of thing. The staff really cannot be any more helpful, it felt as if there was literally a member of staff waiting around every corner to help you find your way around the premises etc, which is great if you are into that kind of lifestyle, personally I prefer feeling invisible. However, I have to add that the conscierge desk went out of their way to help us find our way, which is a real plus in Beijing, where communicating with taxi drivers can be a real challenge. One of the main benefits of staying in upmarket accommodation in Beijing is that all the staff speak excellent English! The location is also great, and they serve a good breakfast. Personally, I would only stay here if my company footed the bill (which they did); on my own expense I would prefer something more low key. The bedroom had that old school drawing room feeling (slightly unhomely, fit for Winston Churchill perhaps); the bathroom though was fantastic and massive!

It was cheaper to book it direct than going through one of the usual find a hotel web sites. It is truly to be recommended.The situation is perfect for walking to Tiananman Sq., The Forbidden City  the shopping area. As we waited for check in formalities to be completed tea was served to us, welcome after the flight  on such a very cold day. One niggle that could have been a major problem was that when we checked in they asked for a credit card as a guarantee. We produced our Gold Master Card which the hotel said was refused. Fortunately our son in law was able to use his China Card. We subsequently discovered, on phoning Master Card in the UK ,that they had asked for identification but the hotel ignored this request. Possibly too much trouble for them or they just didn't understand what they were being asked to do. We were on the executive floor...didn't request this... found that between 5pm  7 pm the lounge was open to us for FREE tea, coffee, wine, beer  a small but nice nibbles table. This included some hot snacks. Considering that a glass of wine in the bar was \u62e220 this was some perk!!Breakfast was included in the price  very good it was too. Buffet style but a very wide choice. You are able to walk thorugh the hotel, intoThe Beijing Hotel  so into an Australian steak house should you be tired of rice  noodles!!If you want to hire a car for the day to see the sites I would recommend that you don't use the hotel desk but walk to the Peninnsular hotel  talk to the drivers outside there. It wil be much much cheaper  yes they will understand you! Since the Olympics there are clearly much higher expectations from the organisers of trips as to what people are willing to pay. We had a car for about \u62e280 for the day to see the Wall etc  an organised tour would have been in the region of \u62e2200 PER PERSON We had asked for a taxi to take us back to the airport when we booked in  it was there on time, not always the case in China", "Date": "Nov 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR712965656", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "UKBubbles"}, {"Content": "You only get B       POOR lounge !!!", "Date": "Oct 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR358334232", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "haifa_traveler"}, {"Content": "Best little brothel in Beijing I'd have to say I was disappointed. I was expecting the Raffles to be the hotel highlight of my China visit but it was the poorest of the six we stayed in. The low points were that on three occasions I was approached by a pimp offering me a 'lady'. This was not in the main Raffles foyer but in the modern extension at the back of the hotel.I also did not care for the smell of drains that permeated the bathroom. Apart from those criticisms it was OK. It is a very grand hotel, living off its past grandeur. The foyer is elegant and the room was well-furnished and comfortable. We had an afternoon tea in the Writers Bar, which was very good.It is well located, a short walk from the Forbidden City and Tiananman Square, and a short taxi ride to the Temple of Heaven. The restaurant/bar area of Houhai is also a short taxi ride away although this a poor substitute if you are used to western style eating and drinking. There aren't many good restaurants within walking distance although we did eat once at one in the Oriental Centre next door (can't remember the name), which the concierge recommended.If you are visiting the Great Wall, miss the crowds and go to the section at Simatai rather than Badeling.

The Raffles is superbly located; it's one long Beijing city block from Tiananman Square and the Forbidden City. It's also a very short walk to the Wangfujing shopping area. I got an executive suite for the pretty incredible price of about $180, but I think it may have been due to the fact that I was staying during Golden Week, which is a pretty major holiday, and must have caused a dip in business travelers. I checked rates for a few weeks later, and the rooms were almost double that price. My room was excellent - a spacious suite with a sitting area/office, a separate bedroom, and a large bathroom, which itself had two rooms - a closet with a dual-sink vanity area and shower, and another room with toilet, bidet, and a large tub. Furnishings were tasteful, luxurious, and comfortable, with hardwood floors, a full-length mirror, and nice Tibetan wool rugs. It was among the best-appointed rooms I have ever experienced.The hotel's lobby was spacious and grand. Check-in was very comfortable, as I was ushered to sit down and I was brought a non-alcoholic fruit drink while my passport and credit card were taken by a pretty young associate, who then showed me up to my room. It was very clear that the hotel is really striving to make a great impression on service. To be honest, I found the whole exercise a bit forced, perhaps because some of the English was not quite up to the standard I'd expect from such a hotel, but I'll give full marks for effort. I did find, throughout my stay, that the bellhops were extremely good and eager to please.Curiously, perhaps again due to the holiday, the hotel did seem eerily empty, particularly given its grandeur. There was a large multistory atrium behind the main lobby, with a few restaurants on the main floor, but the other floors were always empty, and I never saw more than 3 or 4 other guests in the grand lobby at a time. One minor complaint that may be related more to Beijing's municipal water than the hotel - I did smell a faint whiff of sewage in my room on several occasions. My room rate included breakfast, which was a fantastic buffet with western and Chinese options, including an omelet/egg station and a build-your-own noodle/wonton soup counter. Very, very good.All in all, a very nice hotel with a superb location, and one I got at a great value.

The service was excellent, if a little old fashioned. I was even given a drink during the very relaxed check-in process, but didn't drink it as I wasn't sure whether I'd be charged for it! The hotel set up is a little strange, with sections leading off an Atrium area that is a bit like a shopping mall. It was a very modern and but characterless arrangement. My room was more like a comfortable suite and was very good, although it looked onto an ugly building area at the back of hotel. The Executive Room offered free drinks until the early evening, but was disappointing when you had to pay for your own. The restaurant in the Mall area was pretty good (if a little pricey) and very comfortable for a westerner travelling on his own. I booked my room early and received a discounted rate, so value for money was OK. I don't think I would pay their usual prices. One thing to watch out for. The hotel is related in some way to the International Hotel around a mile away on the same road.

In terms of location,look, and cleanliness the hotel is faultless, however the service is pretty appalling. This may be partly due to the hotel being operated as a sister hotel to the Bejing Hotel which adjoins it. Firstly the room valet and telephone operator speak very very poor english. Asking for some tea bags and coffee to be sent to the room, as it was never provided for us, proved to be incredibly difficult and stressful. Asking for an ironing board and iron, again not included was the same. We spent about an hour waiting for the door staff to organise a taxi for us including time to explain where we wanted to go ( most places off the list of well established tourist attractions are often unknown to staff and taxi drivers in China). We attempted to use the swimming pool however because swim caps are required,something we were unaware of and are unaccustomed to, and we refused to pay the extortionate cost of buying them we were refused entry. In the Shangri-La Beijing we simply used caps provided by the pool. The overall impression when dealing with low and medium level staff was off frustration and that we were simple not important to them. The only person with any decent grasp of english was the duty manager who sent us a fruit bowl (a plate of old fruit when) we complained. Although you may want to come here for the location, the standard of service is not 5 star by any means.

The bed is harder than what you might be used to as a foreigner and my husband had some problems, but I slept just fine. We never had any issues with temperature or turn down service. The morning buffet and evening cocktails were quite a treat! We thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our stay at the hotel. The concierge and bellmen were always helpful. We never had a problem getting a regular taxi right in front. They made recommendations when needed and worked hard to make sure our experience was above and beyond. It is true that booking things through them is expensive. We booked an airport pickup since it was our first time in China and we wanted to feel comfortable getting there. The charge was 900CNY for 4 people and luggage. You can take a regular taxi for about 150CNY. Lesson learned. As well, we booked a guide for the Forbidden City and probably spent about 5 hours with her. She was great, but I don't think it was worth 1500CNY. You can certainly find cheaper alternatives for both transportation and guides. But those were both at our choosing so we only have ourselves to blame.

First impressions are good - the lobby has a high ceiling with beautiful chandeliers. However, as was mentioned in another review, there is construction going on around the building, and the view from our Inc. Executive Room was extremely disappointing........ overlooking a building site. Also, the room itself did not meet expectations. It appears much larger on the website photos, than it is in reality. The sitting area and bedroom area are, in fact, quite limited. We noticed stains on the furniture, which is an off-putting experience when arriving after a long flight. We requested another room (with a a view) and were taken back to the original building , where we were offered a Landmark room. No explanation was given as to why we could not have an alternative room in the Inc. Exec Building - which we had booked. We preferred the open arrangement of the Landmark room, although it was extremely dark at all times - facing a wall of another building. Was this the view we had requested? During the night, even with the air conditioning off, the room was cold. Also, we could hear noise which appeared to come from the a/c, but may, in fact, have been due to the construction outside.The bed was wonderful - really big and comfortable. On the first night, when we arrived back at 8:30pm, we discovered we had not had the benefit of a 'turn-down service'. A card was left in the room the next day to say that the service had been available after we had retired at 9pm.. On the 2nd day, we left the room at 8:30am and were astonished to find it had not been made up when we arrived back at 2:30pm. It took 2 calls to the Room Valet before anyone arrived - 30mins later.On our 6th day, no fruit was left in our room - and unlike the other lucky guest - we never had flowers! We also had to request hand towels and small (complimentary) bottles of water.We enjoyed the complimentary tea and drinks offered daily in the Inc Executive lounge, which was a pleasant place to sit and read the newspapers, or check email.The buffet breakfast was plentiful as was the dinner at East 33.I had informed the hotel, in advance, that my husband would celebrate his birthday during our stay. I was promised that the hotel would offer 'the benefits of your birthday'. Very disappointingly, this never happened and no excuse/apology was forthcoming.We found the doormen very friendly - although there is a serious problem with getting taxis from the hotel. Many times the doorman ran outside onto the main road to try to divert a taxi to the hotel for us. There needs to be a system put in place whereby taxis are easily contactable. The concierges are polite but beware, as they tend to promote specific tours /shows etc., which you may be able to arrange yourself, at considerably less expense.Overall, our experience at Raffles was pleasant, although not up to the standard we had expected - and definitely not comparable with the standards of the Peninsula, Bangkok!", "Date": "Apr 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR425838889", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "WaryDubai"}, {"Content": "Excellent Raffles Fantastic hotel, staff excellent.

The only thing I didn't like was that the air conditioning never kicked in (Mid October was probably too late in the season to leave it on), so it got a bit stuffy, especially whenever we were there in the late afternoon getting ready for dinner.We spent a few extra dollars for an Executive room, which includes (free) continental breakfast in their Executive lounge. It was mostly cereals, breakfast breads  pastry, fruit, and fresh juice - I don't remember any hot options. It was all excellent quality, though, and a nice, relaxing way to start the morning.For tourists, the best thing about this hotel is the location. It is an EASY walk to Tiananmen Square  the Forbidden city. Also close walking distance to Wangfujing snack street, and a big mall, so both Eastern  Western food options were readily available. We didn't use it on this trip, but there was also a subway stop a short walk a way - We passed it whenever we walked towards the Forbidden City.We arrived during the Communist Party convention, so there were a lot of military  police personnel wandering around the hotel. It was also much more difficult to hail a cab. When we needed one, a staff member ran down the street a couple of blocks to hail one, and gave the cabbie directions for us - I thought that was nice of them, and above  beyond what they needed to do.If you can afford it, I would highly recommend staying here.", "Date": "Feb 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR573477010", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TravelCat501"}, {"Content": "Wow This hotel was first class from its rooms to its pool.

The room was big and nicely decorated. Free internet a big plus. Unfortunately the communist party has decided that air-conditioning must be switched off in all hotels during the winter months. In theory, air-conditioning shouldn't be necessary in winter time but the room didn't have any windows which could be opened, so the room was very warm and stuffy. The wooden entrance door to the room could hardly be opened and closed as the wood has somehow expanded, so it was more or less required to break into the room each time with force. This seemed to be a general problem with the doors which created a lot of noise.The service was OK but not even close to Four Seasons levels apart from the gym which offered the best service I have ever experienced in a hotel gym. The gym as such is very nice and rather well equipped but the lack of air-conditioning resulted in 26\u63b3 Celsius which is rather uncomfortable for a work-out. There is a nice indoor swimming pool which always was empty. A cap is required so bring one if you intend to swim. Otherwise they are for sale for the staggering price of EUR 6.The Club facilities are OK. Three daily food presentations of good quality.

Some rooms have windows that actually really open. We had a room, where you could only open a 5cm part of the window which looks after opening like an mosquito net.In our first roon, we had had all of a sudden a smell of waste water in the room. The hotel couldn't solve the problem, but offered us another room without hesitation.

I would like to point out that I now know why some people in the previous reviews get this hotel mixed up with a couple of other hotels. The Raffles Hotel is sandwiched between two gigantic hotels that apparently were the big State Hotels at one point, but now are just huge convention type hotels. All three hotels are attached with a ground floor walkway however, they are all three very different hotels. So, it is easy to think that if you stayed at one of the hotels on either side of the Raffles that your perception would be biased in a potentially negative way. Now that I have actually been there and stayed in the actual Raffles hotel as well as walking over to look at the hotels on either side, I can see why people think it is all one large hotel instead of three.Pros: Location is easy to walk to TiAnaman Square, Forbidden City and the major pedestrian shopping street along with three large indoor malls; even though it is a large hotel, when compared to the other upscale hotels in Beijing it is small and has a somewhat boutique feel comparatively speaking; car service from airport is excellent; hotel staff from check-in to check-out were excellent; accomodated a late check out without any issues; concierge was very helpful/polite/professional/knowlegable; breakfast was very good with a wide selection of either western or asian food; room was very nice with awesome amenities both in the bedroom, bathroom and living areas. bathroom was very large with seperate shower and bath and dressing area; service was excellent by everyone we came in contact with during our stay. Also, a very nice asset of this hotel is that it seemed to cater to individual travelers, not tour groups, so there were no big tour buses coming and going, no big groups checking in or out and no big groups to have to be behind when going for breakfast, etc...Negatives: Beijing is being rebuilt at a rapid pace and everywhere you look there is a major building going up or coming down, our room, although extrememly nice had a panoramic view of a major construction job that was going on 24hrs a day, so at night it was a bit loud and large spotlights were distracting while trying to sleepOverall, I would give the Raffles very high marks because not only was I impressed with our stay originally, but when we came back through Beijing, we stayed at a different upscale hotel that is rated higher by all the travel magazines and I thought the Raffles experience was much better and would pick it as a place to stay again.", "Date": "Oct 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR450198086", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TravelWarriors"}, {"Content": "Great hotel The Raffles in Beijing is very well located, just steps from Tiananmen square and close to the shopping district.The hotel has an elegant decor, the rooms are large and have also a elegant decor and all the necessary amenities you expect from a 5-star hotel.

Try to stay in the old part of the hotel - the old English style with hardwood floors, marvelous ceilings and huge rooms. We were also able to see the presidential suite and one additional suite dedicated to a local poet - both furnished with pieces from the Ming Dynasty. The only draw back was the staff didn't speak very much English except for a few at the front desk but they overcome it with willingness to help and politeness. The only food we had was the daily breakfast - it was half continental and half Asian, an interesting mix of choices. I recommend to choose one and stick to it, as hard to mix the flavors - trust me! I also tried their spa in one SPA club. This was the first place in China where I was asked to give a tip and when I gave it I was asked to give more.... I am very much OK w/giving tips but on my own terms. This was not OK. Since I booked through our corporate travel  got pre-negotiated price this was also a very reasonable price for the location. Not sure what is the price for a regular traveler...

That hotel had two wings, an old 1920s wing and more modern tower. Raffles now occupies about half of the 1920s wing, bissecting the still-operating Beijing Hotel, and also has another modern building in the back. The Raffles Beijing Hotel is far more luxurious than the Beijing Hotel, as befits its management by the Singapore-based Raffles group. The Raffles lobby has been beautifully renovated and is now the only hotel in Beijing to offer the ambience of a historic grand hotel in the European style. I recently spent four nights there.Good things: I stayed in one of the executive rooms in the modern building in back. It was huge, with a separate living room and bedroom and a great bathroom. There was also a lounge for breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails. It was a nice place to grab extra bottles of the hotel's free bottled water. The hotel's location was fantastic, right between Tiananmen Square and Wangfujing. And though many cabdrivers don't know the Raffles, they all know the Beijing Hotel (Beijing Fandian).Bad things: Though the hotel looks every bit the 5-star hotel that one expects from Raffles, the service was spotty. I emailed the hotel a week before arrival requesting an airport pickup but got no response. I emailed again just before arriving but didn't get a response until a few days after I checked in (I took a cab from the airport). Incredibly, they said the couldn't find my reservation, even though I was already there! The concierge desk was very friendly and secured some restaurant reservations. But a request to check flight schedules to Shanghai was not followed through until I asked again. One thing that really irritated me was the swimming pool and gym facilities, which appeared to be under separate management from the hotel. The pool has a policy requiring all swimmers, male and female, to wear bathing caps. Not only that, they charge 70 yuan (almost $10) for a cap. They are also insistent on the rule to the point of rudeness.I did get a really cheap rate on the hotel, so overall I was quite happy to enjoy the room and location as good values.
