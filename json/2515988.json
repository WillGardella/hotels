Extremely comfy king sized bed after long days of walking the hilly streets was just the ticket. The Hyatt was very modern and welcoming. The hotel itself was spotless and the room kept extremely clean. Great location and you could walk to Pier 39. There is a cable car line behind the hotel going into Chinatown, and a couple of blocks away the F car line takes you all the way down the pier where you can jump off into different sections of the city, so you really don't need a car if you are just staying in San Francisco.

We have previously stayed out the hotel last September. And once again, our stay was pleasant. In particular, the following is noted about the hotel: All the staff members (front desk, bell and valet) are friendly and willing to assistance in any way possible. The lobby is small but airy, bright, and functional. Check in and out is painless and fast. The rooms are clean and well stock for bathroom supplies (towels, soap, lotions), although at bit dated (our room was an upgrade, however, it was a bit worn - couch was torn, the rug had tears and, moreover, the lighting could have been better, the room was dark). In addition, the bed and linen were very, very comfortable. The pool and sun deck is very nice too (we were lucky during our stay - the weather was unseasonably warm, which allowed us to use the pool and sunning area). The hotel also had a bar and restaurant, which was nice. The food is good (not great but good) as is the drinks. The service is top notch in the bar and restaurant (the bar and restaurant is all together, so you could be eating right next to a party doing some drinking). This hotel is located in a very good location. It is one and half blocks from the Wharf and just minutes to all the key Piers. In addition, it is just a 10 to 30 minute walk to the other districts (Union Square, China Town), or just a 7 or 8 dollar ride by taxi to the same. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel for it's above average service, the great location, and acceptable (for San Francisco) room prices. The only negative side is that the rooms need a face lift (the rooms are clean and comfortable). Also, management should be ashamed for charging $7.95 for the use of the computer in the business center (printing a boarding pass is free). And the elevator are painfully slow. Other than those minor thing, ours tay was very nice.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWow, amazing hotel, amazing value\u201d", "Author": "Gamyleigh", "ReviewID": "UR128028816", "Content": "The only thing I was disappointed about was that I only stayed one night here.

We were given a room near the event location for storage of decorations and for last minute favor preparations.

The reception was held in the north point room with a beautiful fountain and skylight. The banquet staff was superb and was there to help with anything we needed throughout the entire event. The rooms were beautiful, clean and very comfortable. The front desk was helpful, at one point we asked for a roll of packaging tape in order to remove something from one if the dresses, and without question it was delivered to our room!

So i \"talk him into valeting the car\" then i wrestle my bags(heavy) into the very small lobby(i thought it was the concierge desk). i booked a king standard room, i have someone that would prefer to sleep in the bed with me like normal. Well that was to much to ask and they could only put me in a two bed room(not queens) i'm talking small beds. keep in mind i booked a king. its beautiful view of the brick wall was amazing... the beds were decent to sleep in, by decent i don't mean great. I hindsight its amazing what kind of night sleep you can get in your own bed at night. lol. In the morning i went and looked at the breakfast, knowing how service is so far and decided to skip a 50 dollar breakfast and go get food in the wharf. smart choice plenty to pick from whenever. checking out i was going to stop and complain but said why bother.. so getting off the elevator to get into the lobby and i have two 60 lbs bags, then there is these three steep stairs to actually get on to the lobby floor out right out of the elevator, no ramp.. so i a wrestle the bags up the stairs(ok not ny first time), but the point there are bell hops watching me do it. didn't move a muscle, then when i got to them \" is there anything i can help you with\"? (yes please get fired, is what i thought). then back out to the valet where asking for your car is like asking for then to help you move two states away. same attitude as when i got there. I am always an over tipper even when my better half says to give them a bad tip. I don't believe in no tip, so i gave him 50 cents. I hoped it woke him up a bit, to see is worth. Stay downtown... trolley to the sites and the wharf. A mistake is to think staying there is in the heart of the action or sites its not just one. If you really want to stay down there save the money and go for a hampton/fairfield level hotel free breakfast at those places and will be just as nice as their parent hotel.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Asyut, Egypt", "Title": "\u201cNice new hotel at fisherman's warf\u201d", "Author": "HatOrth", "ReviewID": "UR124325319", "Content": "Very nice rooms.

Also, I paid cash when I checked in and also paid the $13 a day for internet, but when i tried to use the internet it wouldn;t work. I called reception and the man at reception was telling me I had not left a deposit. I had to explain three times that I had paid cash when I checked in because he kept saying I had to use my credit card. After telling him the third time, he put me on hold and checked it out. He then apologized and said he could see I had paid already and he patched me through to internet support to get me set up. I just don;t know why I had to explain 3 times that I had already paid before he went to check it out instead of him just saying they needed my credit card and that I had not paid. Otherwise, I did like the hotel. It was convenient and clean and that is what I want in a hotel.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cHyatt @ Fisherman's Wharf - will stay there again\u201d", "Author": "acw3111", "ReviewID": "UR121745207", "Content": "Friendly staff, well appointed room., centrally located if you want to walk around Fisherman's Wharf.

The staff was friendly, helpful, and responsive, always treating us like valued customers. The cost of parking is $45 a night and tax took the amount to over $50. Yeah, our eyes bugged out too, and we'd usually never spend that kind of money on parking...but when we weighed it against the time and expense of other transportation - $25-30 each for a hop-on/hop-off bus, multiple connections on public transit, etc, - we got our car a day early and sprung for one night of parking. This enabled us to make the rounds of several attractions we would have missed otherwise. If you do happen to arrive at the Hyatt in a vehicle, be aware that the driveway, which is more of a square paved courtyard, is often hectic and packed with vehicles. Bottom line: very nice hotel in a perfect location.

Our main focus of the trip was for several baseball games at AT&T Park, so we mulled over different locations in the city for our stay. This was not our first trip to SF, and we remembered that we liked the activity and the location of the Wharf area hotels on previous stays, so we focused on finding a hotel on the Wharf. Having never tried the Hyatt, we decided to go with it, and we were not sorry! Our flight arrived into the are at 945 am, and with the assistance of Super Shuttle, we at the hotel by 1030 am. There was a room available so we were able to check-in early and get the weekend under way. When I requested a check-out time of 130 pm, I was accomodated . They say that the front desk staff sets the tone of your stay, and it was definitely the case with this Hyatt! Luz checked us in, and every time she saw us after that, she called us by name, and made sure our stay was going well. I have never had this type of service from a front desk staff. She made the stay perfect! The room was very nice and spacious. The bed was comfortable after long days of fun and sightseeing. The tv was nice, and the clock had an Ipod dock. The bathroom was spacious and had nice ammenities. The towels could have been a little softer, but as long as the room is clean I can deal with scratchy towels. There was only a shower in our room, with no seat--I could see this as an issue for families travelling with little ones, or someone who is elderly. The room had a hair dryer and ironing board and iron. There was an in-room safe, a small coffee pot. They leave 2 bottles of water in the room--which if used, would add $5 per bottle to your bill. The business center was not up to my ideal BC. There was a charge of $7.95 for the 1st 15 minutes of internet service, although you could go to airline websites to check in and print boarding passes (which I forgot to do before leaving the hotel, so I don't know how well that worked). Since it was a fun weekend, I did not bring my laptop, so cannot comment on the internet service in the room. The outdoor pool is rather small, but fine for a quick swim or for kids to play a bit. It is cool on the Wharf when the wind blows, and it was swirling a bit in the pool area--even though the sun was shining, it was a cool pool day. Didn't try the restaurant at the hotel--there were too many options along the Wharf. The public transportation is close to the hotel--within blocks of both cable car start points, busses, trolleys, and sighseeing tours. Shopping galore (for souvenirs) is within steps--and a short ride to Union Square for upscale shopping. The 30 bus departs 2 blocks from the hotel to get to AT&T park, or the trolley to Embarcadero Station with a transfer to AT&T makes it easy to get to Giants games. Chinatown, as well as Union Square, is on the 30 bus route. If you are flying to the Bay area, and have no preference, the Oakland Airport is as easily accessible to Fisherman's Wharf as SFO.

The rooms are not soundproof because we heard a little, \u201cyipper\u201d dog from the hallway and from our room. We had asked for a quiet room and selected this hotel because they did not allow pets. It was our first night, and we were very tired from traveling. I called the front desk and was told they would let the manager know. They said dogs were not allowed. After an hour of intermittent barking, I went down to the front desk. They asked if the barking was on tv! It appeared the manager knew nothing about it. The manager then went to the room next door and freaked the dog out. He later called our room and said someone was picking up the dog. We never heard it again! They had made a note about it and asked about the situation when we checked out. We got an old-fashioned, classic-style shower with a bit of mold in the tiles and on the curtain. The only towel racks in the bathroom are in the shower. The toilet paper holder is in a hard to reach position. The toilet seat slides around too much. The door to the bathroom opens out into the room and always seems to be in the way. Leaving a couple dollars on the pillow with a note results in a lot of extra towels/washcloths. Heads up for an awkward turn down service if you\u2019re not expecting it. Our door was slightly open when we came back one evening. Thinking it might be a robber, we cautiously entered only to find a female employee placing chocolates on our pillows. Unless you lock the safe, it will bang each time you close the closet door. There is no place to set your luggage other than on the floor. There are not enough functioning outlets. The desk and nightstand contain decoy outlets that do not work for American electronics. There is only one elevator that stops on the lobby floor. It is not big enough for all the guests and luggage. You will have to walk up the lobby stairs if you get one of the east elevators. I signed up for the free Hyatt Gold Passport to use one of the two computers and printer that makes up the small \u201cbusiness center.\u201d Otherwise we would have had to pay. Front desk staff has to log you on each time, and it counts down from an hour. It seems odd to have to pay to temporarily use a computer. Take a walk a few blocks down the street, past the nice bums, to get some food + beverages from the Safeway. It is a bit far to carry a 24-pack of water, but it is well worth the money you save not opening the bottles in the room. Pool closes promptly at 9:00 pm, even if you just got your swimsuit on! They also kicked out all the adults in the hot tub. This is too early. Very comfortable beds & bedding; pillows were a bit too soft. We ate at the restaurant Knuckles once. FYI, you must sit at the bar for happy hour. The portions are very big, so be prepared to split a meal. My lemonade was \u201cbalanced\u201d with electrolytes and cost $5.50. Upon departure, we got a quick airport shuttle for $16 per person from the guy watching the tiny parking lot. There were no taxis to take us to the BART station due to a convention.

Check-in went smoothly and the valet parking was efficient (although at $50/day we thought it should have been). Both rooms were satisfactory, although ours was smaller than we are used to. We had requested a larger double for my daughter and grandson and they had no complaints. My wife was disappointed that our room lacked a tub, something she needs after touring with a bad back. Since the pool/hot tub was on our floor my why decided that would compensate. Early the first morning she went to the pool (outdoors) to do her water aerobic exercises and then soak in the hot tub. The pool was unattended but with the help of a guest she found a towel. There were three young people in the tub who lefty rather hurriedly. When my wife finished her excerises she found the tub filled with what appeared to be soap bubbles so she passed on it. The next morning the bubbles were gone but, a young woman in high heels came in, stripped to a bikini, entered the tub, and appeared to be washing off her make-up. My wife passed on it again. This is not exactly the Hyatt's fault and is a reason some people will not ever go into any public hot tub. A visit to Alcatraz was at the top of my daughter's to do list and she was very disappointed to find all of the tours booked for the period that we were there. As soon as we checked in we went to the concierge to see what she could do. At first she found an opening for Sunday but, later discovered that was a mistake. A few days later my grandson overheard a concierge in Ghiardellii Square day that anyone could get tickets the same day by simply showing up early at the ferry. Apparently everyone in the area knew this except the concierge of the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf. In order to make her trip to the island on Sunday my daughter packed on Saturday night and left us to take care of her luggage and check-out on Sunday. No problem, except after a half-hour wait the bell-man never showed up and I made two trips down by myself. At checkout, when asked about our stay I said that it was just satisfactory for the reasons above. The young woman apologised and removed the parking charges from our bill. This is the first time that I felt the Hyatt lived up to its reputation and a good enough reason to give it another star.

Close to the cable cars and the bustle of Fisherman's Wharf the Hyatt is an ideal base for sightseeing and if we are ever lucky enough to return to beautiful San Francisco we will certainly stay here again.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston", "Title": "\u201cGreat If You Can Walk the Maze to Your Room/ Bad if You Want Free Wireless\u201d", "Author": "emmamikah", "ReviewID": "UR116453379", "Content": "We stayed at the Hyatt this past week and found the following: We traveled with a 20 year old child and we enjoyed the location which was terrific.

Flat screen TV, stylish furniture, aesthetic bathroom, even an iHome iPod clock radio all contribute to a visual delight, sure to appease the well traveled or weary guest seeking the comforts of a modern home. But when you actually start DOING things in the room, you quickly find it\u2019s a case of design for its own sake and not for meeting people\u2019s needs or goals. First, I\u2019ll get this out of the way. The TV was a snazzy touch, but I didn\u2019t turn it on once during my four days. In San Francisco, there\u2019s way too much to do to have time to watch TV. That said, had I wanted to watch TV, I would have been hard-pressed to watch any channel containing the number 7. OK, where to start. How about the iHome clock radio. The clock was set 10 minutes fast, so I thought I\u2019d be able to easily adjust the time. Bad assumption. I scoured every surface of the device more than once and could not find a single control to set the time. Is was not until my last night, when, obsessed with figuring it out, I started to turn a small thumbscrew on the back. As the screw loosened, so did a metal plate underneath it. And then, voila, the plate came off, revealing the controls to set the time. Why? Why hide these BASIC components of a clock? I just don\u2019t get it. More on the clock. I docked my iPhone before bed, noted that it was charging, then went to sleep. In the morning, my iPhone\u2019s power was at 10%. Sometime in the night, it simply stopped charging. Then I noticed an outlet in the base of the nightstand lamp. Great! A feature of the room I can use. But no, the outlet was astonishingly too large for the standard prongs of an iPhone charger. That\u2019s right \u2013 something with standard prongs kept slipping out of an outlet. So, pretty much the whole nightstand area was a fail, unless you count its ability to keep my phone and glasses off the floor. The bed and pillows themselves were really rather comfortable. But they stack the bed with a pyramid of shams that I prefer to not use. (I mean, who else\u2019s heads have been on there, and do they really change the shams?) So, I piled them up on a chic chaise lounge. Next day, housekeeping mounted them again on the bed. So I again piled them on the chaise. Finally it seemed housekeeping got the hint, and for the remainder of the stay kept the sham sculpture on the chaise. Now, we move on to the bathroom, which was beautiful but was a calamity of uselessness. It packs more usability issues per square foot than should be permissible by law. After an evening of traveling to get to the hotel, I had to, uh, empty the bladder. I literally jumped back and yelped when I flushed. It was one of those suction-type toilets that could probably suck down a toddler. The effect was startling. And, grossly, it splashed drops of toilet water all over the place. Ick. From then on, I learned to shut the lid before flushing, lest I get splashed or inadvertently sucked down. And when you\u2019re finished sitting on the toilet, it really helps to have taken some yoga classes so that you can reach the toilet paper. The holder is about a foot off the floor, and placed behind the toilet. It\u2019s a terribly awkward twist, and I was seriously worried about pulling a back muscle. Why put it there, when higher up and on the other side is an unused wooden fa\u00e7ade of the vanity? Let\u2019s talk about brushing your teeth or taking a pill. When I do these things, I prefer using a cup or glass for the water. Yet in this 21st century bathroom, I could not find a cup. I did finally see them in the main living area, seated in front of the $5 bottles of Aquafina. Why put the glasses there? If I\u2019m going to spend $5 on a bottle, I\u2019m going to drink it from the little thingy they designed on the bottle to fit my mouth. Put the glasses where people are going to need them \u2013 near the bathroom sink. I purposely left my used glass sitting near the sink. When housekeeping came, they removed that glass and gave me a clean one \u2013 near the bottled waters. Eventually I tried a trick and left my toothbrush in the glass. Housekeeping left that one alone, but still replaced the missing part of the glass couple near the bottled water. Water glasses The shower was unfortunately not exempt from being almost unusable. First thing I did was try to grab the glass shower door knob so that I could slide the door to the left and reach the shower controls. But oh, how the door did not budge. Then I paid closer attention and noticed that the door was not really a door, but a glass panel that was affixed to the ceiling and the base. The door sliding knob was really just something to hang a towel on. But metal knob on glass door\u2026that\u2019s an affordance I\u2019m used to everywhere else in the world. It makes the door slide back and forth. So\u2026I had to get into the shower in order to turn on the shower. This might not be as much of a problem if it were a traditional shower where I could run the water in the bottom, get it to the right temperature, and then set the diverter to shower mode. The problem with this fancy shower is that the water sprayed down from a square plate-looking object in the center of the ceiling. So the very instant that the water is turned on, it\u2019s raining down on your arm \u2013 whether or not you\u2019ve managed to instantly find the right temperature. So, for me, that meant getting doused with ice cold water on my arm, then having to either reach through the cold rain or sneak my arm around it to adjust it warmer. By my fourth day, I kind of figured out how to get close to the right temperature in a split second and then withdraw my arm before the water totally got me. Thing is, I shouldn\u2019t have to learn these kinds of tricks. Then, we run into the problem of the water coming straight down from overhead. It makes cleaning certain body parts that are, say, on the underneath sides of ourselves rather impossible. I found myself performing certain ballet moves or yoga positions to try to get the water to reach the right places. Oh, it\u2019s great for hair and shoulder washing. But pretty useless for everything else. Square shower sprayer Oh, and because the shower door isn\u2019t a door at all, water splashes all over the floor and even onto the bathroom door (which is a double pocket door, not one with a knob, and I never could get the two panels to meet in the middle; good thing I was solo). Opening to shower If you use the hotel soap and leave it in the wire soap dish, the next day, it has bluish grill marks on it. If you have wet things \u2013 as I did, having come from a whitewater rafting trip and had two wet swim suits, water socks, water shirt \u2013 forget trying to hang them anywhere, as there aren\u2019t any towel bars (except for one in the shower that they use to hang the bath mat towel). There\u2019s that shower door knob, plus a twin knob mounted inside the shower door. But that\u2019s it. The Hyatt\u2019s modern bathroom places all of the towels in cubbies. I\u2019m not sure what a family of four would do after swimming in the hotel pool. How would they dry four swim suits? And how about four towels? If the Hyatt wants me to conserve by reusing my towels, shouldn\u2019t there be a place to hang them? I\u2019ve stayed at some lesser hotel chains that have a retractable line in the shower that you can pull out to hang your wet things. Remember that outlet that was too large for the prongs of a standard charger? Same thing in the bathroom. One of the two outlets was too large for the prongs of the hair dryer or electric razor cord. Simply bizarre. I\u2019m sure there are other details I\u2019m leaving out, such as their placing the coffee maker not by the source of water but instead hiding it in a dresser drawer that I came to use for my socks. If I think of them, I\u2019ll fill them in later. Sitting near the TV was a book titled \u201cWelcome Home.\u201d Feeling curious, I opened it, thinking it was the guest services directory. Instead, with delicious irony, I discovered it to be a catalog of the all the chic items that you can purchase. If you liked all the useless accoutrements so much during your stay, why not buy them for everyday use at hyattathome.com? I say go for it. Just make sure to hone up your yoga skills ahead of time. Post Script At the bar, I asked the bartender to describe Alaskan Amber. He said \"It's an amber beer.\" Wow, really? The morning I checked out, I called the front desk to request a taxi. They sold me on their limo service for $55 including tip. I went down, printed my boarding pass and waited for the limo. Then, the front desk told me the limo was in an accident, and I\u2019d need to take a taxi after all. The 20-minute difference (had they just called the cab for me to begin with) nearly caused me to miss my flight.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location for kids and the Wharf!\u201d", "Author": "JBradleyR", "ReviewID": "UR116308337", "Content": "San Francisco is my favorite US city for business and pleasure and I have traveled numerous times over the past 5 years, sometimes alone and sometimes with my 3 children (now 15, 13, and 5). If you decide to stay near the Wharf with children (more on that below), I would highly recommend the Hyatt. The price is high (as is everything near the Wharf) but well within the range of other comparable properties, and did not feel like a \"children's\" hotel even though it worked out great for my daughters. There was enough of a pool for them to enjoy and a hot tub form to soak my feet. The fitness center was plenty for this type of trip. For comparison, I have stayed many times at the Argonaut hotel nearby for business, and while this facility is a bit quieter, it is certainly not worth the substantially higher rate! One issue with all (or most) hotels in this area is parking. Valet is ridiculous ($50/night) - street parking is available but you must be very savvy, as overnight parking options are dictated by street cleaning patterns and the patrol is out around 7am to catch any late sleepers and give them tickets for expired meters! If I were traveling alone I would avoid the Wharf altogether as an area for lodging, but with children it really can't be beat. We were minutes from numerous eating and entertainment options, which was especially convenient after going out all day exploring. Last year we stayed downtown and found ourselves too tired to get motivated to make it far from our spot at night, while this year we were out most evenings, getting some entertainment, nice breezes and views, and reasonable (touristy) food that was easy for all kids to enjoy.

It took me a couple of days to understand the layout of the hotel but it\u2019s a like an enormous square-cornered figure of eight.

RESTAURANT: 3/5: We never tried breakfast in the hotel \u2013 we had some early starts for tours and tended to go and fetch coffee and muffins from Starbucks (a block away, next to the cable car stop) instead! The Hollywood caf\u00e9 over the road does fabulous breakfasts too! Try the fresh fruit and pancakes \u2013they were amazing \u2013 and the plateful kept us going all day!

Food quality was good, but nothing fantastic. THINGS TO DO IN THE LOCALE: Where do I start?! When we started looking at visiting California, I didn\u2019t know how to divide our time, but San Francisco and the surrounding area has so much to see and do! We stayed there 7 nights, but you could easily stay more! We took a bus tour of the city, walked across the Golden Gate bridge, marvelled at the \u201ccrooked\u201d street, and took (long!) trips out to Yosemite National Park and Napa valley (to sample the vineyards!). The shopping is amazing around Union Square, the Golden Gate park is huge and lovely, and it\u2019s worth spending time at Pier 39 and Chinatown. I also booked a hotel with an outdoor pool because I wanted to make sure that we could relax for an hour or two IF the weather was good enough, and I do think that was a bonus. SUMMARY: There are a number of 3 / 3\u00bd * hotels in the area \u2013 eg. Holiday Inn Express, Radisson, Sheraton etc - and the Hyatt is absolutely fine for a base. Like I say, you have plenty within 5-10 minutes walking distance, and you can also hop on a cable car to get to Union Square (for shopping) and the other city-centre sights. Hotels in the city centre don\u2019t tend to have outdoor space with a swimming pool, hence my reason for choosing Fisherman\u2019s Wharf \u2013 and the Hyatt scores the highest on Trip Advisor in that area.

If you don\u2019t have breakfast included in the stay there is a restaurant across the street that was always busy that served breakfast They have a pool and spa. The days were cool so we only went swimming one day. The pool was clean about 80 degrees. Hot tub was nice and clean and temp. was about 102. We used the laundry that was located on each floor of the hotel. Cost $1.50 for wash and $2.00 for drying. The most difficult part of this was finding the washer and dryer available. There is a Safeway, Trader Joes, and World Market located within two blocks of the hotel. This hotel is located only two blocks from MANY choices of restaurants and fast food. Subway, In and Out, Boudin, and so many others to list. We ate at Scoma\u2019s, and Hillstone mult. times just because the food was excellent. No refrigerator or microwave in the room but it was worth eating out daily because the food was so excellent down there. Parking is expensive no matter where you go. It is $45 a day with in and out privileges. The bell staff took excellent care of us and our car. We parked the car and took taxi\u2019, trolley and the bus to most of the tourist sites. Most we paid was $20 to get to the Golden Gate Bridge. Recommend if you wish to see Alcatraz you get reservations on line early. They were sold out the week we were there so I was thankful for the advice ahead of time.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Varese, Italy", "Title": "\u201cGood choice in Fisherman's Wharf district\u201d", "Author": "KaITrAvEL", "ReviewID": "UR115347342", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for four nights while visiting San Francisco.

It is more of a sports bar/diner set up, but if you have a large group they have a few booths available with individual TV's to watch games. The room was clean and a decent size. No dresser, so only a closet to hang stuff. Bed was comfortable with lots of pillows. The hallways made the hotel seem older and a little dingy, but the rooms were much nicer. The check-in downstairs is impressive and the staff was helpful. A room up against the street would probably be loud, we had a room on the 5th floor overlooking the pool which was much quieter but I could hear kids in the pool in the early morning.

My review is based on the price I paid for the room. If I paid Hyatt's going rate, my review would be somewhat lower. My favorable experience started with the parking valet. He was so nice to let us park our car in front FOR FREE while we checked in and dropped off our bags in our room. We requested 2 beds, but the check in desk offered a rollaway at no additional charge. Our additional bed arrived within minutes, got set up, and he was out of there. We needed ice for our room and I used one of the small waste baskets from the room. We had a few water bottles from Trader Joe's we needed to chill. I get stopped in the hallway by a housekeeper, noticed my wastebasket and offered to get the ice for me because it was completely on the other side of our floor, but I declined it. I order room service and the person on the other end was so courteous to me, he kept addressing me as Mr Smith (not my real last name). When room service arrived with the food, it continued. I ordered the big wedge salad and sweet potato fries. The salad was surprisingly good. I highly recommend it. Every Hyatt employee I encountered was very nice! The room was your basic king standard room and a chaise lounge. Our room was on the second floor which had a view of the roof, other rooms, and the sky. No view, but it was quiet. I thought to myself, who the heck is blowing up fireworks? I found out it was coming from the upstairs room whenever they flushed the toilet! Haha... It took a bit of figuring out, but I finally figured out how to drop the shades to darken the room, open the drapes, and open the window. Haha Ok, the reasoning for dropping it 1 star...the $45 valet parking for registered hotel guests. I actually considered paying the price, but I had a problem with the only option of valet parking. I didn't want anyone parking my car. It's my car. We were in SF coming from Sacramento. So, I used these great Android apps (search for San Francisco parking) to find the best deal on a parking garage in the area and the other app was to determine which blocks had free parking at different times of the day. I paid $15 for an underground parking garage 2 blocks away from about 1pm through 9pm. I found a street parking space in front of the Hyatt from about 10pm until 7am the next day for free. I got lucky finding a street space in a residential neighborhood 2 blocks away from about 7am until 10am - our check out - (no time limits, since it was the 4th of July). Wow...saved $35. The way I see it...I got my cardio workout moving my car around. Oh, and the other con about this place is that it costs $12.95 for unlimited internet. It's $9.95 for 250MB of data. Boo If you want to save some money, there's a Trader Joe's and Safeway nearby. We got our bottled water from TJ's for about .50 cents each.

Check in was quick and very painless. The overall hotel is very clean and modern.

Probably the best bedding and linen around (I have stayed at lots off hotels around the world and do not make this statement highly). The outstanding bedding and linen provided five nights of sound sleeping. The bathorrm was spacious and well equiped (hair dryer, shampoo, lotion, soap, toothpaste). Also to note, the hotel's bar area is very nice (Tom the bartenderr was very nice and pleasant and could he mix a great Canadian Club Old Fashion). The hotel resturant was great for breakfast (the only meal eaten there). There is also the availibility of printing out airplane boarding passes free of charge and an ATM in the lobby. The pool and immediate area is very nice to (the pool was very warm, which is needed due to unpredicable SF weather). The only suggestion I could possible make is that the hotel needs a movie channel availalbe (AMC or TCM, for example), and a full shower door (to prevent the bathroom floors from getting slippery from the excessive water).

The rooms were always clean with ample toiletries & Coffee/Tea provided daily (if I had one complaint it would be that if you do not request to have your bedding changed daily - to help with the environment (as most hotels do these days) then the bed is not made up as it would be if the bedding was changed, if you do not leave the bedding turned back the bed may not be made or made as neatly as it is on arrival). We had a room on the third floor over looking the Jacuzzi, other members of our party had a room at the far end of the Pool, this was never an issue with privacy or noise, the pool area is open from 7am - 9pm, each room has net curtains and a blind and from the outside you could not see into the rooms (maybe you might see in if all room lights were on and it was late evening but you would pull down the blind if you were in the room).

We were in one of their larger guest rooms which meant the window was at one end overlooking a very drab court yard - or as we referred to it \"exercise yard\". As the window was at the end of the room, there was little natural light and with the walls painted pale blue, there were only a few lamps and they didn't emit much light, it was nothing short of depressing. Yes, it would seem they have tried to 'modernize' the rooms, but you know, you can paint an elephant, but it is still an elephant. There were 4 of us in the room, yet each day we had to ask for additional towels as they would only leave 3. We didn't leave a tip at the end of our stay (normally we do for housekeeping) as it seemed to be optional whether the trash was taken away and in what quantity & given we were there for 7 nights, there should have been more attention paid to cleaning. The beds were small & uncomfortable and the bathroom door opens into the middle of the room - 2 issues with this: 1. if you had the bathroom door open and one of your party opens the external door then you would want to hope you were covered up as anyone walking past can see right into the bathroom. 2. it's pretty easy to knock one of your party out if they are standing in the wrong spot and you open that door too quickly - dangerous with children! Agree with other - where is the concierge? Never to be found or always on the phone! Location is good for first timers to San Fran, but now we know our way around, we will stay in Union Square next time. Make sure you pre-request a fridge a they aren't standard room equipment.

We eventually chose the Hyatt because it was somewhat cheaper and ticked many of the boxes in terms of Modern Decor, and we specifically called and requested the corner deluxe room due to its size, and it was about GBP 300 cheaper for the 3 nights than the other hotel. Upon arrival and check-in we were advised our corner room was not available but they have downgraded us to a smaller room taken $50 off for each night. I told them it is unacceptable because we had spent weeks if not months choosing and preparing for our room choice. I also mentioned that one normally gets UPGRADED when the hotel cannot fulfill our booking. (There were conferences being held there which may have not helped our situation) We grudgingly went up to see the downgraded room. We decided to take the room as the room was still fine in exchange for breakfast on all 3 days, the $150 off and a bottle of wine. That aside we took our things up and made peace with the new abode. The room was relatively large (called an oversized room), Modern, spacious, had an entire wall of windows which was great. The bathroom was clean and big and luxury with a massive walk-in shower. I guess a bath would have been nice - but we just used the hot tub downstairs instead. We did find some men's toenail clippings that had been missed when the room was cleaned up before our arrival - but they sent someone to sort it out. The room had a flat screen tv with cable channels, a massive kingsize bed, coffee machine and they had moved a portable refrigerator up for us and there was an ipod dock alarm clock.- Nice touch! The room was quiet and faced onto the pool and hot tub. Biggest hotel complaint is the lack of free wifi. Ended up costing an additional $30 and only one of us could use it at a time. Breakfast at Knuckles was great - loads to chose from from scrambled eggs, to pancakes, to potatoes to cereal - I had the guy make me an omelet which was divine. Our package included two full day transport passes/muni passport which meant you could ride the bus and cable cars as much as you wish - very useful. Cable car turnaround is a block behind the hotel, two starbucks' nearby. The piers of fisherman's wharf were about 5 minutes away and ghiardelli square about 10 mins walk. Its a bit touristy but it is very well connected to the rest of San Francisco within minutes. Good restaurants are the Plant Organic restaurant on Pier 3 (take a cab - like 6 quid or walk for 20 mins) and also the Boudin on the actual wharf was great.

It is about a block and a half from the wharf so you can EASILY walk it in less than 5 minutes and far enough that you don't get any wharf noises or smells! I feel like this is the nicest hotel I could get for the low price of $149/night. Yes, it stinks that they charge $45/night to park here ($51.30 w/tax) but even at $200/night I couldn't find a nicer hotel especially with this great location! I drove all over the area looking for alternate overnight parking. There is a shopping center across the side street but they have signs that they'll tow for non customers and the parking meters all around hotel (and town) are 1 hour maximum and $3 per hour! It just costs money to park in SanFran! The staff was very friendly and accommodating. It was my daughter's 21st birthday so they sent up a bottle of wine and a lovely bowl of fruit. We also requested a mini refrigerator and it was delivered happily and quickly with no extra charge! The rooms were very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The shower had great pressure and I had no complaints. The hotel has been renovated, however, the hallways are dark and show signs of age. (That is just nit-picky.) The hotel is clean and nice and a great value. Also, the free wireless internet is a plus and was not taken for granted. So many hotels still charge and we had great service! We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant but did notice there was a Denny's across the street. Also across the side street is World Market where we got bottled water, liquor, snacks, candles, etc and next door to that is Barnes and Noble with a Starbucks and a Starbucks across the street from that!!

Overall stay was positive. I choose it for location and I definitely had no complaints on that front. Easy walk to pier area and all the tourist things in Fisherman's Wharf. Hotel itself is pretty standard. They have obviously spent some money recently on re-doing the lobby and rooms. Newer furniture and you can tell that they are trying to go for more style. My room was a good size, clean and quiet. Staff were generally very helpful. I checked in very late on a Friday night and the night clerk wasn't very knowledgeable about the area. Suggested Denny's as late night eating option when I found several places open after midnight on my own. Also wasn't sure how long it would be to walk to the Alcatraz pier the next morning. On the other hand, he was so friendly that I really didn't mind. Overall I thought that is was solid value for the money. If you want to be by the Wharf and need a nice, non-flashy hotel, the Hyatt is a solid pick. In terms of tips, there are a lot of different recommendations about Union Square vs Fisherman's Wharf. I visited both spots. A friend of mine who grew up in SF recommended staying somewhere other then Union Square. Great during the day but seedy at night. I was surprised by that but take it for what it is worth. Also recommend the Alcatraz tour. Standard tourist thing but very, very interesting. Other then that SF is a great city to walk around.

The shower was good, enough space to put your things, a small fridge and a flatscreen TV. We had a king bed and slept like babies. We did not hear any noise, outside or in.

The good service that I have experienced in other cities continued here with the friendly bell hop. Efficient Check-in and we had a reward certificate for complimentary bevarage (was sceptical about what this would be). When presented at check-in was surprised to be shown a list of drinks and food and could choose one from each list, we went with some Soda and fresh baked cookies. We had a call from Room Service just after 5pm to say that they were baking the cookies and will be along soon! Never really use in room dining but was impressed with the update. Room wise, we were in a deluxe corner room on the 5th floor, with a view of the gas station and cable car turnaround. We walked around the hotel to get to the cable car, and I don't think there are any real 'views' from any outer rooms I guess it might be nice to have a view of the pool but we only have 4 nights so were not overly fussed about this. The room also included a large refrigerator (as requested). If you want a refrigerator in your room, do remember to request this through the Hyatt E-concierge before you arrive (no extra charge), as I do not think that they are included in the rooms as standard. Furnishings very good, a few scuffs on the walls and the window blinds could do with replacing but nothing major. Coin operated washer/dryers are included in each floor (remember to have plenty of quarters if you think these will be required), quite handy as we were moving on to another city after this stay and felt a lot more comfortable with this than a local laundromat (some of which did not look too inviting). Breakfast was included in the package, otherwise would not have bothered (not worth $18 per person for buffet) although adequate, not of the quality have experienced in other similar Hyatt properties in the USA. Breakfast is taken in Knuckles Bar / Diner which is attached the the hotel and is not really big enough when the hotel is busy, but we were staying over Labor Day weekend. However, Knuckles is very good value for food and drinks during the day. You can walk to Fishermans Wharf in about 10 minutes, and then on to Pier 39 for all the tourist things including the sea lions and then the Alcatraz boats leave from Pier 33 (remember to book this in advance of your trip, we went on a Saturday and the next available tour to buy that day was the following Tuesday)! Great tip for a sightseeing tour - Gray Line operate a 2 hour tour in an open top double decker motorised cable car. It is only $20 and takes in all the usual sights. The tour leaves from Pier 39 hourly between 10am and 5pm. The driver is also the guide and the driver for our tour was hilarious!

I am so sick of hotels that nickel and dime people like that. It would have been nice to have a mini fridge in the room. They didn't do the greatest job with the refreshments for our conference...they obviously only wanted to do the minimum and didn't refill coffee or anything like that.

We stayed for three nights at a rate of $119 per night + tax with a $25 food and beverage credit (which we used at their Knuckles restaurant) and a 1500 bonus Hyatt points. We are very happy we stayed at Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf because it is within walking distance to some of our favorite restaurants and attractions such as restaurant Gary Danko, The House, Slanted Door restaurant, Alcatraz landing, and Pier 39. The rooms are clean, the bed is very comfortable and I like the many electrical outlets right at the desk for charging our electronics. The valet parking at $45 per night is pricey but we saved parking fees elsewhere because most of the places we went to were within walking distance. During peak check-in hours, we feel the staff was a bit overwhelmed including lines at the concierge desk and our luggage not being delivered in a proper and timely manner. In our room, the safety deposit box is located too high in the closet so it is hard to see to make sure you didn't leave any of your personal items behind. The rain shower head is annoying when it is not an addition to a standard shower head...and the doorless walk-in shower looks cool but not practical as the glass panel is not long enough to contain water spills. The flat screen TV is nice but a bit too far if you are sitting on the bed. If you wish to take a nap during the afternoon and you have a street facing room, don't be surprised if you hear tour bus guides narrating on a loud speaker. Overall, despite the above negatives, we will stay here again because of the comfortable bed, cleaniness and the good location.

Pros: The biggest thing is the location. It's just a block or so from a lot of the touristy attractions, which are a little cheezy but still a lot of fun. It's also a relatively short walk away from a lot of the cool San Francisco sights as well. They also have a really friendly and helpful staff. The concierge in particular was awesome and gave me perfect directions that saved me a lot of time and hassle. Also, they have the most comfortable bed I ever slept in and the rooms were really spacious and clean. But perhaps the biggest pro for me personally was the great deal I got. Granted, I went in a totally non-typical time of the year in the middle of December, but I felt like I got a heck of a bargain by only paying around $110 a night. Cons: They really could use an indoor pool. San Francisco is pretty cool most of the year, so having one outside doesn't make a whole lot of sense. They should also really look into finding a way of making the rooms quieter. The location and hotel was pretty quiet in general, but some rowdy younger kids woke me up a few times at night. I'm glad those kids were having fun, and realize that the hotel can't really do much about that. But they could look into insulating the door jams a bit better to prevent this. But for me personally the biggest con is that there are really no frills. Well, there are, but at a high price. It doesn't make sense to me that you pay LESS a night at a nice place like the Hampton Inn and get things like free wifi and free breakfast. Paying a bit more at a place like a Hyatt and not getting those kind of things sort of stinks. But those cons aren't that big of a deal.

It is also close by to the rental car offices in Beach St (we were picking a car up on our departure), and is also on a couple of major bus lines - we made our way to both AT&T Park and the Tut exhibition using the bus.We only ate once at Knuckle's, but this was good.

Our 5th floor room was well appointed,clean and comfortable with a good supply of hanging and drawer space.

The staff is extraordinarily pleasant. We ended up upgrading our room to an Oversize King option so I can\u2019t speak for the regular rooms. The location is fantastic; you\u2019re within easy walking distance to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf if you go down the hill and Ghirardelli Square if you go along the street. There are other sights you could try walking to but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it and the #47 bus goes right by the front and that will take you to most of the more distant places you\u2019d want to check out. Parking is insanely expensive but San Francisco is a unique case when it comes to parking, you can park for about $32 per day if you\u2019re willing to walk 2 blocks from a nearby parking garage at the Walgreen\u2019s which is actually a significant savings over what the Hyatt wants to charge. They do love to charge you for everything. Internet either on TV or WiFi (but not both!) is an extra $10 per day. The TV Internet is dodgy, the wireless keyboard needs a perfect line of sight to work and even then you better hunt and peck because anything faster won\u2019t work. Frankly I\u2019d rather have something wired to the desk that works than a fancy wireless keyboard I could try to use in bed that doesn\u2019t. And the controls are far from intuitive, read the menus carefully before proceeding. It\u2019s a little outrageous when you think any Motel 6 charges $3 for WiFi per day and at a Travelodge it\u2019s usually free but with the money you\u2019re paying to stay at a Hyatt it\u2019s more expensive than most other places. I suppose their regular guests can afford it and the business people can write it off anyways. They have the $5 bottles of water but that\u2019s fine with the vending machines and Walgreen\u2019s nearby and pretty standard. They do provide free whitening toothpaste though which I thought was a nice touch, and plenty of towels and pillows all around. The TV was nice and well placed. The room came with a coffee maker but the coffee it produced wasn\u2019t worth the time, two sips and the rest you want to send down the drain. The desk/TV stand was very handy and had electrical outlets coming out its ears in very convenient locations which we appreciated. The phone by the bed however had so much static on the line it was incredibly hard to hear who you were calling. The d\u00e9cor was fantastic. The bathroom was very modern and stylish which was nice but the door wasn\u2019t really a door so much as a sliding wood panel as if you were stepping into a closet and it was a heavy wood with no proper handle so you really had to thrown your back into moving that thing and it didn\u2019t have a lock which wasn\u2019t a concern for us but may be for others. The bathroom was large; there was no bath in our room but rather a very modern-looking shower where water essentially cascades out of the ceiling. It sounds great but the pressure isn\u2019t the greatest and since you can\u2019t really adjust the head coverage is splotchy. Overall we were really impressed however the room did lack one thing \u2013 there was actually very little information about the hotel itself. It mentioned some services and numbers you could call which was grand but it didn\u2019t have, for example, the hours of the pool. Nor did it state if local calls were free, which they almost always are but after the price of their internet access I began to wonder. It had a room service menu and some limited information about their restaurant but after 11pm it all pretty much shuts down. What good is room service that stops before midnight? Usually room service is a godsend when you get back late at 3am or something and want a good meal. On the whole this is an excellent location if you can afford it but don\u2019t expect the greatest value and while they do the grand flourishes and stylistic touches fantastically they seem to sometimes lose sight of the practical.", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississauga", "Title": "\u201cLocation is great, clean, but I think you could get better value..\u201d", "Author": "bflojim", "ReviewID": "UR45394997", "Content": "The Hyatt Fishermans wharf, is clean and in a great location.

(We stayed on California St for the rest of our trip, which was walkable for both F.Wharf and U.Square.) The staff was very professional. Breakfast in Knuckles (which is nice room, with a trendy-ish bar; there's also cool wooden beams on the ceiling) is table-service or buffet at 18dollars for fairly good food. The front desk and concierge area is nicely decorated. The pool is fine and the area gets plenty of sun, but the pool water dried out our skin more than usual! (not sure what's going on with that.) The fitness centre is very good: treadmills, bikes and cross-trainers (all with TVs); weights, drinking water, sanitising wipes, cold towels, dry towels, earphones. The layout of the hotel is extremely confusing: you'll find yourself getting lost along the maze of green (read: 'puke-green' walls and brown carpets) hallways to find your room. In fact, the decor on all floors (except the lobby) is absolutely depressing (seriously!!) and there's no natural, and very dull artificial, light in the hallways. The decor in the rooms is not much better - they're a sad grey, with brown carpet. Let's just say, you won't look forward to coming home to your room. Toilet and shower, but no bath; the toilet doors are a bit weird and don't fully close; there's also no fan, so you may need to de-fog the mirror with your hair dryer. You'll also hear everything in the toilet from the room! Nice flatscreen TV, 2 phones and a safe. Comfy bed. If you've your laptop, internet access is 9.99 for 24 hours of a pretty speedy wireless connection through a T-Mobile hotspot (so you could use an existing T-mobile account on your credit card, or charge it to your room). There's 2 PCs in the lobby but web access is something like 6 dollars for 15 mins!!! However, they do offer free access to the websites of all airlines leaving SFO, so that you can check-in online and print your boarding pass. It's also possible (but difficult) to print documents for free from your memory stick (but you need to be a bit wiley, and I think I wasnt supposed to be able to do it....) Vending machines, and a washing machine & dryer, on each floor; however, the venders were a bit fussy, some were out of order and you'll need dollar bills (they wont accept higher denoms). Overall, its not a terrible place but management needs to work on cheering up the accommodation.

We were pleased with the room but when the bell boy brought our bags my husband mentioned that we would have liked a better view but it was OK (Our view was of a courtyard) The bell boy told us the hotel was full but if we were staying for a few days then we may be able to move the next day, we said we were intereseted and he said he would try to make it happen. The next morning I went to the front desk and the women was very pleasant and helpful she brought up our account and said they would be able to move us that day, she told me just to pack up and leave the bags in the room and they would move us while we were out for the day. And they did just that when we returned around 4pm our bags were in our new room on the 5th floor over looking the trolley turnaround on Taylor and Bay ave. Also when I reserved the hotel I requested a refrigerator which was not in our room when we arrived but when I called the desk to ask about it they said they would send one right up and it was there within 10 minutes. There is a safeway (supermarket) two blocks away, go out of the hotel and turn right go straight for a block and a half and there will be a parking garage on your right and the entrance to the supermarket is inside that garage, we made many trips here since our first breakfast at Denny's cost us over $50 we decided we would try to cut back with breakfast and some lunches and eat dinner out, and if you take a minute to fill out the paperwork for a safeway card you can save alot more. One day we bought rolls and lunchmeat for sandwiches but I forgot about plastic wrap and/or foil so I went downstairs in the morning and asked a woman that was putting away the complimentary coffee if there was anything I could use for this and she was helpful enough to go into the kitchen and get me some foil. Everytime I asked anyone for anything they were more than willing to assist me. I would definately recommend this hotel, the alarm clocks are I-homes and my son had no problem charging his I-touch on it. Besides the high price for parking that everyone has mentioned, which did not bother us since we just got a 7 day muni pass and rented a car when we needed it, which was only to go out of the city. The only complaint I could possibly agree with is the internet fee $10 per day seems high,I was under the impression that you could log onto their computers for 15 minutes at a time for free but that is not the case those 15 min will cost you $6.95. I'm just glad I did all my research ahead of time and we didn't really need the net, we were on vacation after all. you are able to sign on and check bags and print boarding passes for free which was nice. The muni pass is great the trolleys are normally $5 one way although they are busy on the weekends during the week we used them frequently. The F-line is also cool to ride but we also used the buses alot they can get you anywhere in the city you want to go. If you plan to visit Coit tower there is a bus that takes you up to it, this is one bus worth taking we did not know about it until we got to the top of the many, many stairs that you must climb to get up there, definately take the bus and then for a small fee ride the elevator to the top of the tower for some great views all around the city.

It was easy to use and inexpensive, but be prepared for an uncomfortable and sometimes scary experience. - The pool is located on the third floor which we found strange. Just a heads up if that is where your room is located. It closes at 9 PM (probably to accommodate those sleeping on the third floor.) There were lots of people using the pool and hot tub during our stay and they were both not large enough to accommodate everyone. - The bathroom does not have a locking door. (Hopefully you are quite comfortable with the person you are staying with.) There is no exhaust fan for privacy or drying out the room either. The shower \"door\" is a glass panel that only covers half of the shower so the spray goes all over the bathroom. Make sure you have plenty of towels down. It looked like the hotel was going for something ultra modern, but failed to think the space through all the way. - Knuckles is the restaurant attached and has great food. We ate there twice. - The internet is not free. However, you can use it at no cost to print your boarding pass.", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco Bay Area, California", "Title": "\u201cEat at the Restaurant, Don't Stay at the Hotel.\u201d", "Author": "PinkRoseBouquet", "ReviewID": "UR37367236", "Content": "I made a reservation with this hotel, on their company website in early July for a weekend stay in early August.

The front desk people were polite, but for some reason they seemed not interested in having me as a customer. They offered no helpful information other than to tell me my room wasn't ready with no estimated time for checking in. No worries-- I won't be back. The room was clean, but rather drab for the price. The bed was very, very comfortable. The shower was nice and roomy, with good water pressure. This property is clearly coasting on its location, however-- a shame, since I've stayed at the Marriott, Holiday Inn and Hilton (not at Fisherman's Wharf, though) and gotten way better service. Go to one of these (especially the Marriott, which I've never had a bad experience with) before looking at the Hyatt. Save yourself the potential aggravation.

The cable car stop (Powell-Mason line) was a block away and the nearest supermarkets were a couple of blocks away (go out of the hotel and turn right, take the 1st left onto Taylor and then left onto Bay. At the end of the block is a grocery store and then a Safeway and Walgreens about half a block along again). The room itself was really nice, large and had obviously been refurbished not long ago. Colours are blues, browns and greys so very contemporary. We had a huge bed with lovely linen and loads of pillows. There was also a couch in the room and a very large flat screen tv. We asked for a fridge to be in the room and there was a small one sitting on the floor - not sure why this has to be asked for I thought they were standard but obviously not anymore. There was heaps of storage room in drawers and cupboards. Only issue you might have if you were there on business is that the desk also doubles as the tv stand which didn't seem to leave a lot of room. There was a coffee maker thingie in the room with takeway cups which seemed to be handy (I don't drink much coffee so didn't try) The bathroom was large and the only complaint I would have is that the shower had a long glass screen but no door so water tended to get out onto the floor. The room was serviced well everyday. We had a drink one night in the bar which was fine although a little on the pricey side but then this is San Francisco. We didn't eat there but the food that was being delivered to the tables looked great. We ate breakfast across the road at both of the little cafes.

The rooms were very spacious for a city room, although we all had inner-facing views from the window - meaning the bad news is you had no view of the street, but the good news is no noise from the street. :) Two of us suffered allergies while there, so I'm not sure if it was from something in the room or from being in SF (we are from the East Coast).

The parking attendant was more than happy for us to get checked in and take our bags up to our room and leave the car outside while we did this at no charge. At check in we were given the type of room we had asked for although the check in clerks couldn't be described as overly friendly. The hotel itself is very nice and clean. The bellman took our (4 large) bags up to our room quickly for us and we headed back out (stopping to ask the concierge the best way to the car drop off location - he was helpful and gave us a map). Our room was a good size and everything was very clean the whole time we were there. We were in an internal room, which overlooked the pool area, so it was probably a bit darker than other rooms but very pleasant (and i'm picky). We asked for a fridge and at no expense it was delivered to our room within 15 minutes. The bathroom is a good size and the shower lovely (nice tiles/ good size). The only thing I didn't like about the room was the fact that the bathroom door was a sliding door and therefore there was space at each side that you could see in.

While connection was perfect in my first room, it was not 100% stable in the second room - no mini bar - in standard king rooms, no chair/sofa provided (twin double have 2 chairs, larger Kings have a sofa) except at working desk - no self-parking in hotel garage, they offer self parking in a garage nearby (13$ cheaper than hoel valet) There is an onsite restaurant: Knuckles Sports Bar and Grill. Although being a sports bar the food was very good and provided a very nice menu (also for vegetarians). I would definetely recommend the Knuckles. The very warm welcome from an exceptionally friendly gentleman has been the perfect start for a casual little dinner with consistent food quality both times we ate there. Overall: very good choice in this part of San Francisco.

I had booked a deluxe suite directly from Hyatt's website, and felt a bit foolish not to be using priceline, but since we must have a suite, this was the only way to guarantee one. Anyway, the first suite we had was a very large corner unit with huge window. We loved it until I tried to take a bath. Huh? What? No tub. Yup. Imagine that. To top it off, it has one of those \"European\" showerheads which shoots water from the ceiling directly onto your head. (By the way, I've been to 7 European countries and not once did I see this type of showerhead.) Moreover, the shower has no doors, just a glass half wall. And the seal on that wall isn't great, so water was leaking onto the water on the other side. And the door (sliding style) to the bathroom was so heavy, I had trouble using it. I called the front desk and asked to be moved to another suite with a tub, only to be told that all the deluxe suites have the European showers. Hm! Well, I hated it enough to take a smaller room. In hind sight, I should have insisted on a rate reduction. And yes, I should have just booked on priceline. We ate at the restaurant for breakfast twice, and the food was so so. Service was impossibly slow though. I could have made the whole meal myself, leisurely eat, read the paper, and finish all the dishes in the same amount of time. I suppose they're used to have tourists order the buffet than just individual orders. The pool was clean and warm. Hardly anyone was in it until the afternoon. It was only 3 feet deep, so there were a lot of kids in it. The jacuzzi was tiny and was too \"foamy\" for my taste, so I didn't get in at all. Like others have mentioned, parking was $45/day plus 14% tax ($6.30). There are several parking lots nearby for anywhere between $10-$35/day. Since I didn't know how secure they were, I didn't want to be penny wise but pound foolish. Overall, we liked it well enough and may return in the future.

Lighting was plentiful, though the elderly might have some difficulty in manipulating the small turn switches on the lamps. The bathroom towels, shampoo soap etc were all of a high standard.

On the night of arrival, we paid for the $32 a night parking since it was late but every night after that, we were able to find off-street parking for free.

It is a modern hotel, looks quite smart and well situated near Fishermans Wharf in San Fran. Initially we were well pleased but once we settled in we became aware of one or two problems which people need to be aware of. Firstly the hotel claim to offer tea and coffee making facilities. True, they do offer it but you have to pay 10 dollars each time you use the facility as you can only use their coffee packets etc. Once made up you have to drink it or it becomes strong and horrid so it is an expensive mug of coffee. Also, the dining room is quite nice but dreadfully noisy particularly on match nights as it becomes packed with people watching the games. There is no other facility to eat other than room service. One would have thought a hotel this size could have offered a place to have a peaceful dinner. The internet service offered was the most expensive of all the hotels costing us almost 30 dollars a day. Ouch! The Holiday Inn across the road from us was advertising free internet access. If only we had known we could have saved a lot of money. We were given a room which had an adjoining door. Beware if they give you one. Our next door guests decided to put the T.V. on and make noisy phone calls at 4am. Sleep was impossible. When I complained the hotel staff offered us another room but as we only had one night left if didnt seem worth moving all our gear so we stayed put. Big mistake! There was a repeat performance. Finally, we checked out by using the hotel T.V. check out which promised to e mail the receipt.

We used the Sport bar on two occasions and found the food good but perhaps a little pricey, but no more so that any other hotel of this class. Only negative side was the cost to use the Internet.

Our 2 essential criteria for our SF hotel were a pool and a great location. The Hyatt has both. After 3 days in SF, I asked my 6 yr old what he liked best about SF. His immediate response, \"the hot tub.\" Having a pool is really a huge plus for my kids, otherwise I would have booked a nice B&B. Our other 'must' was excellent location for sightseeing, not shopping. Hyatt hits a home run there, too. Right near Fisherman's Wharf and lots of public transportation. The location was superb. The hotel was very nice in all regards, although there was not a free breakfast. Usually we ate at the Hollywood Cafe across the street - not cheap but large portions so you could share, and the food was excellent and fresh. The Hyatt concierge was pretty helpful. We could have booked excursions through the hotel before we got there, but I think it was better that we did it separately (also, before we arrived - that was very helpful). I don't think the hotel's recommendations were that great. Use TripAdvisor to find the best things to do and the best tour operators. We ate in the hotel's restaurant, Knuckles, one night. Nothing to write home about. There's a new Thai restaurant (something Moon? Pearl?) just a block closer to Fisherman's Wharf, decor was like a cafeteria but the food was very good and relatively a bargain. SF ain't cheap! Two nights we ate at an Italian restaurant two blocks to the right as you exit the hotel, on the same side of the street. It was quite good, not cheap but won't kill you. The Holiday Inn Express across the street looked a bit cheesy compared to the Hyatt, but it's actually rated a bit higher, sounds like it has free breakfast and I think it has a pool, too. If you don't care about staying in a fancy-looking hotel, I'd book whichever one gives you the better rate.

If you rent a car from Avis 1.5 blocks away - they let you park in the garage for free so you don't have to pay the $40/ day at hotel.

They said they were fully booked and this was the only room available. Apparently though, this worked to our advantage because the hotel has a two bed to a room policy. This meant that if we had a two queen bed room, we could not have had a rollaway bed, but a king bed room comes with a sleeper/ couch which isn't classified as a bed so we got a rollaway bed as well. We stayed in seven hotels in total during our vacation in California but this was by far the most comfortable. BUT..... the room we were given was a disabled room which meant that we didn't have a bath tub, but a walk-in shower room. The problem was that the shower head was set at a height of about 5' 5'' and my husband is 5' 11'' . Also the shower has an area of about 2' x 4' of a tiled floor sloping towards the drain separated from the rest of the bathroom by a curtain.

First and foremost, it's a great location, but a bit on the steep side for the amenities. I chose not to spend the $10 a day usage for the internet. On the upside, it's literally two block sfrom the Wharf and a short walk from Ghiradelli Square to Pier 39, the main \"shopping/ tourist\" spots. The cable car stop is behind the hotel. I was traveling with my elderly mother and my two sons and sharing a room was not an issue in terms of space. The rooms were comfortable, bedding was fluffy, but if you're looking for a firm bed, that's not what you will get. Surprisingly, there is no mini bar (or fridge) in the room, and there is no fan in the bathroom either The rate we got via AAA was better than the internet rates, plus AAA rate got us free buffet full breakfast each morning (eggs, fresh fruit, bacon/sausage, banana bread, etc), which is a huge savings. We chose the hotel for their outdoor hotel, but who knew that SF weather in late July would be so cool (it's like Maine weather so a bit cool for the pool when we stayed here). Downside is they only have one concierge on duty at a time, so the wait to get any information about tours or maps can take forever, and if the younger of the two is on duty, i wouldn't even bother asking him restaurant recommendations or suggested tours or routes. He wasn't very helpful and didn't seem to enjoy his role as concierge. The older gentleman was wonderful and extremely helpful and informative. The Radisson and Holiday Inn were close by as well, and are less expensive, if you don't want to spend the $270 a night at the Hyatt. TIP: Best place for dim sum is New Asia on Pacific Street in Chinatown, it's authentic and delicious. All the local Chinese eat there..(Yang Sink is the one the concierge and everyone seemed to recommend, but it's in a corporate office building, and it's really tailored to non-chinese tourists, and although a nicer setter and delcious food, is very expensive for dim sum).

Here's a idea, bathrooms are a tool for your stay they need to provide a function and when it's over designed for visual appeal it looses the function. A two inch deep sink does one thing... it splashes water, most of it on you. As for the shower it has a recessed shower head in the ceiling, I am 5 10\" and can adjust it my friend is 5 5\" and she had to get on her tip toes ,someone who is 5 3\" or shorter better bring there tooth brush into the shower and poke at it if they want to adjust it. It is also in front of the of the shower handles and the shower door does not slide. This means you have to turn the water on standing under it for a nice blast of cold water until you can dive out of the way or until it's warm enough to get back under. Some other things might help this hotel get the 4 or 5 rating the would like and that is don't let the city or whoever position a giant dumpster in front of your hotel.

The rooms were large enough, clean, and appeared to be newly remodeled. The kids loved the big screen TV and I-Home. However, they were disappointed that they did not have a DVD player in the room (or even any to loan out for use). After a long day of touring San Francisco, it would have been nice to relax with a movie that everyone could see (we brought some movies but had to watch them on the laptop). The beds were nice and comfortable. Even though there were big parties going on at the hotel, our room was quiet.

The concierge was helpful with directions, but not so useful when it came to things like restaurant recommendations. When we asked her for breakfast options, she really pushed the hotel restaurant. However, after walking around, we found plenty of choices nearby. We crammed as much as touring as possible into our long weekend \u2013 the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Chinatown, Hait Street, Lombard, the farmer\u2019s market at the Ferry Building, Nob Hill, Union Square, and of course Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Here is a list of some of the family friendly restaurants we enjoyed\u2026. Hollywood Caf\u00e9 \u2013 across from hotel \u2013 very good, reasonable breakfast but cash only Pat\u2019s Caf\u00e9 \u2013 behind the hotel \u2013 delicious breakfast McCormick & Kuletos in Ghirardelli square \u2013 excellent happy hour with full entrees Four Seas \u2013 Chinatown \u2013 Dim Sum Calzones \u2013 Little Italy \u2013 yummy calzones & Mojitos Frytes \u2013 French fries with all sorts of dipping sauces make a great snack Burgermeister \u2013 one of the better cheese steaks we\u2019ve had Ghirardelli soda fountain for ice cream, of course\u2026. As with other Hyatt properties, the biggest complaint is the absence of the little things, such as coffee in the lobby and free internet. With a few extras that probably don\u2019t cost much, Hyatt could turn a good stay into an excellent one.", "Date": "May 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Experience\u201d", "Author": "smoofinator", "ReviewID": "UR16002319", "Content": "I recently returned from a stay at the Hyatt in Fisherman's Wharf.

He also told us about a wonderful restaurant called Sardini's on Columbus Ave. It was the best Italian food I've had in years! The rooms were modern and decorated very nicely. Loved the bedding, and the shampoo/conditioner/soap in the room (Lavender citrus). My one and only complaint is that the hot tub closes at 9pm. We got home from dinner and wanted to take a dip because San Fran can get very chilly, but it was already closed. The courtyard where the hot tub is located is surrounded by hotel rooms so they probably can't keep it open late because they don't want to disturb these guests, understandably.

Check in was fast and efficient, although we were given the wrong room type initially. I suspect the rate we booked might have been a mistake as it soon disappeared online, and that the hotel were trying to get away with giving us a standard room because of this. Anyway, this was no problem and we were swiftly moved to a Deluxe (Corner) room. The room is lovely and large, with huge windows on two sides overlooking Coit Tower in one direction and towards Nob Hill in the other. The room was decorated in soothing grey/blues and neutral tones, and was truly a relaxing and pleasant place to be and wake up every morning. The bed was large and comfortable and the room was equipped with a soft seating area in one corner, a table with four chairs and a huge desk area - nothing had been overlooked. The entrance lobby was large enough to accommodate an extra bed for our 4 year old which worked great as it felt like she had an area separate to ours. The table and chairs was a fantastic bonus, as we were able to comfortably enjoy take-outs when getting over jetlag and not feeling like eating out. The bathrrom was large with a floor to ceiling window (which let in lots of light but it was rather disconcerting to sit on the loo overlooking the buildings opposite!!). Unfortunately our room did not have a bath, just a large walk in shower. We did not notice this until after the bell boy had left us, and did not have the heart to complain again, due in no small part to the room being so fantastic in every other way. The breakfast included was good with plenty of choice of cereal and dried fruits, yoghurts, toast, muffins etc and a small selection of cooked items. We had to pay extra for our small daughter but this amounted to probably $12 a day including tip, so we didn't mind too much as we were getting a good deal overall. We didn't eat in the restaurant/sports bar, but it looked busy and buzzing when we passed. The pool area is nice, although in April the heated pool was not heated enough to compensate for the rather chilly air, but no matter. Overall this was one of my favourite hotels during our trip to the US. We were once loyal Fairmont guests, but decide to forego the opportunity to stay there on this trip to San Francisco. At no point during our stay did I ever regret this. The Hyatt is well placed for touristy things that kids like at the Wharf and is convenient for transport links elsewhere.

I tried to use Hyatt's Gold Passport early check-in several times during the day of arrival, but was unable to secure a room. Instead of a larger, deluxe corner room we were given a very tiny standard room. At least they didn't charge us the original price! Second problem: The noise! Our room was on the 4th floor overlooking a busy street and the traffic, car alarms, loud talking and yelling after the bar closed and delivery and garbage trucks in the early morning kept us awake for most of the night, every night. If you can, request one of those no-view courtyard rooms. Third problem: The bathroom. Beautifully designed, no doubt, but not very functional. The sink is so shallow that you can't wash your face without splashing all over the counter top. The shower head, which is mounted in the ceiling, was impossible to turn on without drenching half of your body in ice cold water. There's no tub and I'd have enjoyed a good soak after being out in the rain all day. Speaking of water, one morning the hotel seemed to have run out of hot water. Also, the lighting was very dim and there was no make-up mirror. The good things: An extremely comfortable bed, a great location, friendly and helpful valet guys and a big TV. It was newly renovated, very clean and the maid service was great. The walls seem thick -- we never heard anybody on either side of us, or in the corridor.

This young Lady Concierge was even able to persevere in brilliantly solving a complex problem of furniture-bought shipping to Europe.

It consists primarily of cardio machines such as treadmills, elliptical machines, stationary bikes, and a small but adequate free weights corner. On top of the consistent Hyatt touch, this property benefits from proximity to area attractions such as Alcatraz, Pier 39, the postcard pretty Golden Gate Bridge, and the shopping mecca of San Francisco\u2019s Union Square.", "Date": "July 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Astoria, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "travel_mom_805", "ReviewID": "UR7872728", "Content": "Newly Refurbished about 6 months ago - beds are extremely comfy.

It\u2019s a very quiet hotel. We had neighbors, but I never heard them once. Nice heated pool and hot tub. The rooms are decorated in a blue and brown modern theme, which we liked very much but which wouldn\u2019t appeal to everyone. Only a few downsides for us, one of which was the bathroom \u2013 it was beautiful, but the sliding doors didn\u2019t close completely or lock, and the shower was only half enclosed, meaning that you\u2019re in there and the back half of the shower was open. This led to water getting out and it being a little colder because the steam could escape. Also, the shower head was a \u201crain\u201d type shower head from the ceiling. Very nice, except that you have to reach under it to turn the water on, so you got a cold blast to the head when you reach forward. And one other picky thing \u2013 the ice bucket is so tiny that we couldn\u2019t have two cans of soda in the ice at the same time. So one of us had to drink it warm. I asked for a second can and they said sure, but it never turned up. I didn\u2019t follow up. And finally, the internet access was awful. $10.00 for a day, and you have to connect through the television. The keyboard was awful, you had to POUND on the keys to get them to type anything and it was totally frustrating. I spent about an hour online to do what would take five minutes at home. And the reason we got the access was to check my husband\u2019s work e-mail, which we couldn\u2019t do anyway since it wasn\u2019t a secure enough connection. And if you bring a laptop, you can\u2019t use it for internet in the room anyway. We didn\u2019t check out the sports bar because there were so many other great places to eat and drink nearby.

Not a location I'd normally choose, but had a free night from Hyatt and it was the only Hyatt hotel I could get into in the Bay Area. The hotel ended up being sold out by the time I arrived, but I received the room type I requested. I asked for a quiet room and was told by the friendly front desk clerk that the hotel is \"a very quiet hotel.\" I've heard that story before, but it really was true. Normally I'd like a view, but as this hotel is only 5 stories high, most of the street-facing rooms look into hotels that are across the street. And the streets around the hotel are pretty busy with traffic, vehicular and pedestrian. My room was on the second floor overlooking a \"courtyard,\" which is just the roof of the hotel. It's pretty claustrophobic, but I just wanted a good night's sleep and I got one. Although the hotel was full, I didn't hear a sound all night. And my room was an adjoining room. The place is built like a bunker, and is incredibly well insulated. I got a newly remodeled room that was very stylish (something you'd see on \"Top Design\" when they designed hotel rooms) in a blue/brown motif. The only part of the room not redone was the old white bathroom tile surrounding the tub. That looked bad. The rest looked great. (I've stayed at the Grand Hyatt on Union Square in the past, but their rooms are in such dire need of a makeover, I'm trying to avoid the place until they spend some money making them look a little less like, well, 1987). My experience with all the employees was terrific... everyone was exceptionally courteous. Didn't have breakfast at the hotel, but there are many places to eat nearby. I got an Egg McMuffin and ate it sitting on a bench overlooking the bay. Highly recommend it. The only downside of my stay? Parking is a rip-off at $43 a night (including tax). Nearby lots charged at least $30 overnight, but you do get valet service at the hotel. Had to wait about 25 minutes for my car when I checked out, but the valets were really working hard to fetch cars (everyone was leaving at the same time), so it wasn't their fault. All in all, a surprisingly good stay at a very nicely redone hotel (some public areas still sport the old decor, which is rather incongruous with the new design). I'm not sure I love the neighborhood (wildly tourist-y in a slighty seedy way) or would come back for another stay for that very reason, but it's an excellent choice if you want to be 3 blocks away from Fisherman's Wharf.", "Date": "April 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!!!\u201d", "Author": "blakebrown", "ReviewID": "UR7239964", "Content": "I just got back from a stay here and have to say this was a great hotel.

I would highly recommend this hotel for business travelers; at the same time, it is above average for tourists.", "Date": "July 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "sheralic2005", "ReviewID": "UR5469814", "Content": "Great place to stay.

Our two negatives were: > Fishermans wharf ain't the greatest place in the world, in all honesty. The one plus of this was that there was a tram stop just around the corner which made Union Street and China Town easily accessible. > The diner (\"Knuckles\") didn't impress for breakfast - we tried it once and decided to go elsewhere from then on.

Not only was the staff extremely friendly and welcoming, but the hotel was in an excellent location and exceeded our expectations given the extremely reasonable rate they offered on line. I had used trip advisor to narrow down our list of possible hotels and can't figure out what some of the other reviewers were referring to when they said that the rooms were dirty and not up to a 4-star rating. We found the hotel to be very clean and the beds were some of the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept in. The noise level was low and because my in-laws plane came in late that night we opted to eat at the restaurant's Bar and Grill which was reasonably priced and everyone enjoyed their meal. The restaurant offered a pretty basic menu, but all of the dishes were great and we were thrilled to be able to eat in such a convenient location given the late hour (11pm). At the suggestion of another reviewer, we caught a quick breakfast at the Sunrise Cafe across the street the next morning before heading out for a day of sightseeing.

It is in walking distance of seafood restaurants, the sea lions, the ferry to Alcatraz, Ghirardelli Square, and the cable car turnaround.
