It was a disaster. Actually we had booked for hotel number 4 or 5, do not remember now, but they made us stay in this one. The room was very small, dirty and old. The breakfast room had only 2-3 tables for 2. On the last day we had to eat in our own room because there was a huge queue for tables. We could have only bread and tea from their breakfast, added our own cheese and had our breakfast. We were afraid to use any kitchen supply in the room because they were very very dirty. The only reason that we did not walk out of this hotel and looked for another one is that the money was charged at once as we entered the hotel without a glance at the room. Certainly I would never stay in this hotel again.", "Date": "July 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Value": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincolnshire, England.", "Title": "\u201cCheap and Nasty.\u201d", "Author": "axus41", "ReviewID": "UR8125825", "Content": "I needed somewhere cheap to stay for two nights. But cheap does not mean dirty and this place is. Small, dark, dingy , dirty room. Furniture which could have come from a skip and edging strips hanging off. Cheap, thin pillows, sheets and towels (clean) but the blanket looked as if it had not been washed for years, and I didn't dare pull the spare one out of the \"wardrobe\" Bed squeezed into a recess with headboard against the window. Draped curtains which were filthy - I kept wondering what might fall out of them onto me during the night. En suite there but very small and dirty. Kitchenette in a cupboard - fridge. clean but the rest a health hazard. Dining room squeezed into the understairs space with only four tables (hardly room for 8 people although they had squeezed in another chair. No tablecloths (which they show in the photo.) and, again, grubby. Certainly not a place to take children!!!

The room was the most horrific hotel room I have ever stayed in, absolutely filthy, shared facilities (I had booked ensuite) in a dark dungeon-like basement. Couldn't believe that they would even try to ask anyone to stay in this room. I arrived late in the evening, and had to go back across the road to the other hotel (that's where receptionist was) and then to an Internet cafe to print out the description from Venere to show that what they were giving me was not what I booked.

The dust was so thick on the shelves somebody had wrote clean me in it and the toilet still bore the stains of the last guest - not nice! Breakfast on morning one was toast because there was nobody about to cook or get me a knife to pread jam or cup for coffee! Second and third day i had a cooked breakfast...one hard egg, one small sausage, one rasher of bacon and the tiniest portion of beans ever and it didnt even tast good. On the fourth morning I learned that, despite having paid for breakfast, it cost an extra \u00a35 for their \"full english\" which is a joke! Just had toast again, this time with coffee and jam. Skipped breakfast on the fifth day and I am now wiriting this, still on my fifth day. I will not be paying for my two breakfasts when I check out, not least because I was not informed of the charge. On the good side, the rooms were cleaned daily (although the toilet was not touched until day 3) and clean towels provided every three days. Kitchen facilities are good, very useful, especially the fridge for milk and cold drinks and the kettle. The location was good, on the same road as the nearest tube and only a short walk for supermarket/newsagents/restaurants(i recommend 'as greek as it gets') and a few bars Overall, this was not good value for money at all. If anybody is on that much of a budget I recommend www. studenz. com Their hotels are not luxurious but also not as bad as this hotel and they are cheaper with better locations as well (but be warned that eaton house has the same problem of four flights of stairs and no lif so if you have a lot of luggage avoid this like the plague!)", "Date": "October 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cDirty, shabby & small\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5333542", "Content": "We stayed at this 'hotel' for four nights. My first impression was that it was dirty, shabby and in need of a good clean and re-decoration. The room was tiny, not a room at all more a a section of corridor, with just room for a bed. The furniture, such as it was, appeared to be sourced from skips. The shower wasn't working properly, you risked being scalded as the temperature gauge wasn't working properly. I didn't dare look at the mattress as I am sure, judging from the rest of the room, that it was filthy. There was no iron, although one was provided when I requested it. When we went down to the dining room on the first day we were told that we couldn't get any breakfast as we were too late even though it was before the time we had been told at the desk. On a subsequent day we were told that we shouldn't get breakfast at all as we were self catering. The rooms were paper thin and we could hear it every time a tap was turned on, etc. I would have left straightaway but for the fact that they had my credit card details and would have charged us anyway plus the fact that we didn't want to waste the few days we had on looking for accommodation. I would advise anyone booking a hotel to avoid this place like the plague. I am surprised that it passes the regulations needed for providing accommodation (if there are any!).

It was the smallest, most disguisting room I have ever had the misfortune of staying in. We had nowhere to place our luggage except on our beds or in the small walkway between the entrance door and crappy bathroom. What concerned me most was that if there was a fire while we slept, we would have died trying to get out with our suitcases being in the way. Reception staff were totally useless. There was no reception desk at this property, you had to play chicken with busy Warwick Road to obtain assistance from Exhibition Court 2 across the road. The shower was not attached to the wall and no matter how many times we asked, no one could get a simple screwdriver to attach this. Their excuse was that a plumber didnt work on weekends. When we tried to shower, water went absolutely everywhere. The bathroom floor will cave in soon due to all the water seeping under the crappy lino. My husband had to shave using a kitchen pot as there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even a bath plug. Silicone was used to patch up everything from a broken toilet cistern to being 8cm thick around the bathtub alone. A garden view is of overgrown weeds and shrubs with rubbish bags and junk piling up outside. When the room was serviced on our last day, they forgot our replacement bath towells. Even if the rooms were free, do not stay here. This is no exaggeration. It will definitely ruin your London experience.

Be warned that these hotels are not the bargin of the century. They are cheaper lower quality hotels. Warwick road is very busy and rooms facing the street get a lot of noise.

The breakfast \"room\" was a small hall in the basement. The standard breakfast consisted of toast (with butter and jam) coffee, OJ, and tired corn flakes--and that's it.
