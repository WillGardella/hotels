The tiki bar is a great place to meet other hotel guests; it felt like we were all on vacation together. We had breakfast there one day and it was well worth the price - it's buffet with made to order eggs and waffles, and even the warm food in the buffet was much better quality than we had the previous day at Sizzler. The hotel was a perfect location to Universal Studios - maybe a $10 cab ride, although you could walk it if you'd rather. Considering the parking at Universal is $15, well worth not having to worry about driving home after a night at City Walk. The hotel is right in the middle of everything in Orlando - all the restaurants on I-drive and the outlet mall just a 5 minute drive. We would definitely stay here again - we had a blast!!

First, the price was right there, very competitive. Second, I don't know if you can do better when it comes to proximity to Universal for the price. The hotel is a stop for a shuttle to the park. Unfortunately, they were the first stop of about 5 before you got to the park. The subsequent days we walked to the park (15 minutes over a bridge spanning the interstate, reccomended). I would assume by car it would be two or three minutes. not having a car, (we flew in and cabbed to the hotel, $50+) we were limited in our traveling the area. This was no problem, as our focus was the theme park. There were many options in the park for meals, but be prepared to pay. We ate twice at the restaurant in the HGI, the breakfast buffet being the highlight. Freshly prepared omelets, eggs, bacon,hash browns fruit, waffles, pastries. Really nicely done, worth the price, and eliminated the stress of finding a good breakfast spot. Don't bother looking, or going to Dennys. Have your breakfast here. Dinner was another story, however it was christmas eve, and we ate in our room, so we got pizzas. Not reccomended, but thats just one option from the menu. I can'tspeak forthe rest of the menu. The room was clean, and quiet and included everything we needed. Beds were a bit soft,( I'm accustomed to firmer) The staff were cordial and attentive from the omelet chef to the tiki bar tender. The pool was more than sufficient to satisfy our 11 year old, clean and well kept. There were always sufficient towels and lounge chairs, some of these under cabana like structures.

Sand Lake Dr should be avoided at all costs during rush hour traffic. That said, if you are in Orlando merely to go to Disney, I would go to the Buena Vista area, but if you want a place close near Universal or downtown this is a great choice. Downtown Orlando is certainly underestimated as an Orlando destination and I would highly recommend a visit to Lake Eola during your visit. As far as price goes, HGI usually runs around $100/night as compared to other hotels for $125+.

Our two teenage boys had their own double beds and bathroom in a spacious room and we had a kingsize bed in the interconnecting room. The rooms were of a high standard and daily service kept them really clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The pool was excellent. We were extremely pleased with the facilities and service and would highly recommend this hotel to families wanting high standards of comfort and service while they explore the theme parks and restaurants. This hotel is suitable as a base and not for relaxation in the evening as there is limited bar and no entertainment facilities within the hotel. The lobby area is merely a waiting-type space and not a place to chill and relax in the evening. We did not eat at the hotel in the evenings as this was not recommended to us through comments we read on tripadvisor. Indeed, we found the restaurant and outside bar area empty on a nightly basis. Breakfasts were limited. I dont know whether limitations in bar, dining and entertainment reflects the purpose of the hotel which is to provide high standards of comfort and service (very friendly and helpful staff) at a reasonable price. I presume that raising the standards in bar, dining and entertainment would also raise the cost of staying in this hotel. We did not require entertainment and dining as we spent the day and evening at the theme parks and in recommended restaurants. This might not suit others who require entertainment, dining etc in the evening after a long day visiting the theme parks or who want to skip these every so often to spend time chilling at the hotel. I think with a little more imagination (and without raising the cost too much), the dining area could be transformed into a bistro-type bar/restaurant with comfortable sofa-type seating offering a good standard and range of food and bar service including cocktails. This would encourage people to relax and dine in the hotel which would create a livelier atmosphere. I wonder too whether offering a basic massage service would add to the overall service of this hotel. This need not cost much (ie a basic massage room) and I'm sure would be a hit among those attending the theme parks and walking for miles in any given day!

My husband and I agreed to attend along with several other friends and family members. However, approximately 2 to 3 days before our scheduled arrival, my husband came down with a severe cough. We didn't think it was anything serious. On Nov 18, we contacted our doctor. He requested that my husband come in for an emergency visit on saturday, Nov 20. Finally, we were told that my husband had a severe case of bronchitis and that he should immediately began taking antibiotics, drink lots of fluids, but most importantly, rest. After notifying the hotel of his condition, I was informed that the only way to cancel our hotel stay and receive a full refund was if my husband was admitted to a hospital, accompanied by a hospital note. I find it demeaning, as well as unjustifiable that a person has to be admitted to a hospital before your hotel recognizes them as having a serious health condition. I travel a great deal with my job, as well as personal travel and have never encountered such deliberate disregard for others. It is obvious that your company's only interest and goal is \"to get as much money from customers at any cost.\" Therefore, I have decided that I will not patronize your company due to this policy. It is unfortunate that my husband came down with this condition prior to our scheduled visit at your hotel, however it was unexpected and unforseen on our part.

If you get a rate that includes breakfast, you'll be very happy. Internet use in the business centre is free, and there was usually a computer free. But what really made our stay was the pool and tiki bar. We were there in peak time, but the pool was never too busy, we could always get a cabana, and there are free towels provided for pool users. There's a warm spa pool as well. The staff at the tiki bar were great, with a happy hour from 4-6pm, and you could order food from the restaurant and have it brought out to you.

I did that the following morning only to find out the bus was already full, and fills up THE DAY BEFORE. Upon returning back to the HGI, they did call another free shuttle service, which took us to the park, but at a little later time. So, my advice is, reserve the shuttle the day before for the following day departure. They only have 2 departure and pick-up times in the AM and PM, so make sure you are aware of that. The (second shuttle) service will actually pick you up any time you want to come back from the park, so I used them mostly. Otherwise, things were fine.

The room was always clean by the time we returned from our day trips. There is a pool outside with a Tiki bar that is open in the late afternoon. We took the option of having the breakfast included in our stay, and I am so glad we did!! This was a great value. Hot dishes were made to order, and cereals, muffins, fresh fruit and waffles were self-serve. I don't recall ever having a better breakfast anywhere. If you can, include this option in your booking! This hotel is close to everything. Universal Studios was quite literally around the corner, and Disney was only 15 minutes away. I'm not sure of shuttle services to these parks though, as we had rented a car for our stay. Parking at the hotel is free to guests! A water park is within walking distance. Restaurants are abundant in the area, many within walking distance.This hotel is also close to major malls, grocery stores and outlet malls.", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boynton Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cI drive area hotel breakfast for charge...\u201d", "Author": "RJ24R2", "ReviewID": "UR69889932", "Content": "I drive area hotel breakfast for charge at standard hgi lobby bar restaurant.

Our room had an old tv but some other rooms appear to have flat screen tv's. The rooms were painted in a tropical colour ie. pale green.

When leaving the hotel we each had two bags so did not want to walk to the road to get a taxi so we asked again for a taxi that would accept credit cards again a unmarked car arrived half way to the airport he pulled into a connivence shop and told us to go in to get money this was extremely annoying as we were using international credit cards and were going to be charged both for using the machine and an extra 10% from our bank for cash withdrawls this extremely annoyed us as we had specifically asked for a taxi that accepted credit cards and even asked again before getting into the car. Once again we were charged alot more for the trip as a normal taxi.

We paid $38 per night, using Hotwire - they call this a 3 star hotel in the Universal Orlando - I-drive North area. We had a quiet 3rd floor room near the elevator, overlooking the parking lot, which I liked since I could always see my car below. There are no additional charges for parking, WiFi, use of the business center or fitness center. There is no free continental breakfast, but the breakfast buffet was $12.95 and looked extensive. Coffee was free in the morning. I think this rate was incredibly inexpensive due to our stay being Monday - Wednesday, and school still in session. I was very surprised at how close this hotel was to Universal Studios, and yet still close to restaurants & shops. There were no hidden \"additional fees\" except Orlando's hotel taxes, but many nice amenities. There were 2 shuttles to Universal at 8:30 and 10:00 and 2 returning at 4:15 and 7:20. Universal opened at 9 and closed at 7, so we thought this was perfect since we planned to stay all day. Shuttles to/from Universal Studios arrived about 10 minutes earlier than the posted 8:30 time, and waited the full time for all to arrive at the pick-up points, but left promptly. So don't be late! It was wonderful not to have to pay for parking at the park, and the hotel does not charge a parking fee either. We brought my daughter's manual wheelchair with us, and the shuttle driver simply put it in the luggage compartment beneath the bus ( a big Greyhound-like bus). We arrived at the Universal entry gates well before the opening at 9 am even though the shuttle did stop at the hotels across from Universal first. Check in/out was very smooth. Clean and welcoming atmosphere everywhere. Shower/bath was clean, had good water pressure and drained appropriately. Cold A/C. Double beds were comfortable with fluffy comforters. Ask at the desk how to use the sleep number beds. Having the microwave, coffee maker and larger mini-fridge in room were a nice plus. We ate in the room or at nearby restaurants on International Drive because that's what the kids wanted. The hotel restaurant was small, but dishes looked elegant - served inside or by the pool. Walgreens & several restaurants (I-Hop, Denny's, Red Lobster, Sweet Tomatoes, Ponderosa) all within walking distance. The outdoor tiki bar and large hot tub were a welcome sight after a long drive and long days at the park. Pool was heated and towels were free and always available. My children especially enjoyed the \"babysit a goldfish\" option, available from the front desk. It made missing our pet at home a lot milder. Front desk always took the time to speak with my children and inquired regularly as to whether we were enjoying our stay. They also offered a free cookie. Didn't use the fitness center, but noticed that several guests did. It, too, looked clean and fully operational with newer equipment. WiFi worked great in room and lobby. This hotel met and exceeded our expectations because of the kind, helpful staff and overall cleanliness. On the first day, I went out the back door to the car, after giving my room card key to my daughter at the elevator. A maintenance worker saw me do this, and gently asked, \"Did you know that you need your key to re-open this outside door again?\" Then, he offered to wait at the exterior door until I retrieved the items from my car so that I would not be locked out.

They say you can walk to it, but they don't recommend it as it is a fair bit away, even though we could see the Hulk and Dr. Doom's fearfall from our window. The other thing, and this is absolutely no fault of the hotel, is DO NOT order from any menu slipped under your door. ESPECIALLY Pastino's Express.

The room was fairly spacious with neutral decor, flat screen TV(good choice of channels), work desk, fridge, microwave and armchair. The soft furnishings were fine although the chair had worn through and ripped on the arms. Housekeeping was spotty, differing amounts of towels each day and sometimes the pillows/bed cushions left on the chair/floor rather than being replaced on the bed.

The pool area was nice, plenty of loungers and towels and the tiki bar opened at 5 each day so was a good spot for a drink after dinner. We opted for a breakfast package and this was the only real disappointment. The food was absolutely fine, although a little limited in choice however the service was very poor.

Wasn't overly busy when we were there so the pool and bar was very relaxing and both were open until 11pm. This is GREAT value for money - don't waste your money on the more expensive hotels nearby.

Good size bathroom with marble top & strong shower (over the bath). We ate in the hotel a couple of times and although the food was a bit more expensive than eating out, it was very good. All the receptionists were very friendly & helpful. Jon on the desk that dealt with the Theme Park tickets was also very friendly & helpful & did not try & push you to buy things you didnt need or wasnt necessary. He was also a good point for information. I would ask for a room with a view overlooking the pool as i think the other side of the hotel looks out over the car park. As other people have mentioned the hotel was very quiet, no kids etc running around making alot of noise, and no outside noise to bother you either.

I dont know what if any shuttle services they have since we did not ask about it. I have to say check in was great the staff was nice and helpful. We asked for driving directions and they gave us a accurtate print out of driving directions to each major theme park and attraction. they had the rolling carts for your luggage and two elevators. Our rooms were very clean and had everything we needed. Fridge and Microwave and two double beds. A/C worked very well. We booked the bed and breakfast package and it was awesome. For breakfast they have bacon, sausage, fruits, bagels, toast, cereal, yogurt, different types of milk, fresh orange juice coffee, teas, they had fresh cooked to order french toast, omlets, waffle maker with fruit toppings, muffins, pastries, oatmeal, grits in all it was a complete breakfast with all you can think of.

The Garden Inn, however, is a of a different breed. My 7-night stay in a double standard guest room was strictly for business. The location of this hotel is isolated from the main strip, so it is very quiet at night, allowing for a good night's sleep. Check-in was a breeze. My roommate and I were able to check-in individually without having to wait for the credit card holder of our company to check everybody in as a group. Bethzaida, who assisted us with our check-in is very friendly and helpful. My room was cleaned and fixed up nicely prior to my arrival, giving me a nice warm welcome. The bed is very comfortable, the water turns hot or cold almost instantly. The bathroom is clean and has ample space. The room is also equipped with a TV coupled with 60 different channels for your entertainment. Nintendo 64 entertainment is available for a fee. A nice micro-frige is available to keep beverages and leftover food nice and cold. The included microwave allows you to conveniently warm up said leftover food. And if you have any dry goods, like oatmeal, you can store them in the cupboard right above the microwave to avoid clutter. If you need internet access, this hotel provides complimentary high-speed internet access at your finger tip. The CAT5 ethernet cable is provided, so you do not need to bring your own. Aside from the core amenities mentioned above, the hotel also includes a small fitness center, a pool, a business center, and a Tiki Bar open for business to supply your alcoholic needs after a long day of work or play. Laundry room is available at the end of each floor ($1.00 for cleaning, $1.00 for drying and $1.00 for detergent available at the pantry pavilion). Coffee is served in the morning. Breakfast can be had at the American Grill in the lobby for a small price. They also serve lunch and dinner as well. The overall atmosphere of this hotel is very businessesque. There were no noisy children or horsing around that are prevailent in other hotels nearby. Not even at the pool. I have no complaints other than the pillows. There were only two pillows per bed and they are very, very flat from usage. I had to double stack them to make one barely comfortable pillow and even then wasn't very comforting. I recommend bringing your own pillow for your stay.
