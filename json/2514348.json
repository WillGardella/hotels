No sleep number bed as those are reserved for the king and queen sizes. (Also, while there are no coffee machines there is a Starbuck's downstairs). The room of course was cozy but we used to live in NYC so we are familiar with close quarters. It was clean and though the plumbing is a bit slow, at least it did the job. The housekeeping staff were lovely as well. Having the 51st Street subway right there was really handy and we used it alot. I can't imagine finding a cheaper hotel in NYC for what you get.

So I called reception and told them about the underwear as well as the missing duvet. The underwear didn't get much of a comment, but he did get housekeeping to come re the duvet. They turned up quickly, but with a duvet for a double instead of a single bed and one that looked like it had seen better days and was very heavy. We asked the guy to go and strip a bed in an other room which he refused to do. So we asked for a woolen blankets which he went to fetch, huffing and puffing though. No mention of the underwear.

We paid $14 for 24 hours use of wi-fi and it worked only sporadically and slowly, despite multiple calls to the front desk and to their internet technical support line.

She then said \"Avoid the 7th floor\", right before the elevator stopped for us on the 7th floor, and we all laughed. Perhaps the rooms on the other floors are nicer and have been recently renovated.

We arrived at the hotel after a long flight around 8 pm, only to be told that the hotel was overbooked and we would have to wait for them to organize us a room. Strange, because we had clearly stated in the reservation that we would arrive in the evening. After almost an hour of waiting we were finally given a room. Not only a room but a suite. Nice at first glance, but sadly it had only one queen-sized bed and we had booked twin beds. The receptionist even tried to argue with us about that, at least until I showed her our booking confirmation and she conceded that yes, we had in fact booked twin beds. Never argue with your guests, that's tourist industry rule No. 1. This wouldn't have been that much of a problem if I had travelled with a close relative but I don't usually make a habit of sharing beds with acquaintances. We would have gone to a different hotel after that but it was already 9 pm and we were really tired after a long day of traveling, so we stayed. Bad decision. The next morning we had to leave at 6 am and asked for a wake-up call - which we didn't get. Aren't these usually done automatically instead of in person by now? Luckily I suffered from jet lag and woke up shortly before 6 so we barely managed to catch our bus. The only positive thing I can say about this hotel is the location.

We know that bugs are everywhere but its a bit unnerving to find a roach in your room, especially when it crawls across your foot and the carpet is black so its very difficult to see if they are anymore. We were allowed to switch rooms (our request) and upon checkout we were given comp. parking but even then we were treated like its no big deal. I just feel the whole situation could have been handled better. Also we ordered room service we tried to get a bottle of champagne and were informed they only had one kind available (there were at least four on the menu) we ended up getting 3 martinis which came with ice in a glass that you are given in your bathroom. We didn't even drink them, they tasted so bad. That being said the bell hop was extremely nice and funny. I wouldn't say the experience was horrible but it was less than enjoyable and I will not likely return.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cTiny rooms\u201d", "Author": "CobusP", "ReviewID": "UR124499214", "Content": "I'm writing this review mainly to inform others that the rooms are not made for more than 1 person.

We were up on the 19th floor round the back and tho' the view wasn't great it was very quiet during the night and not too busy in the hallway. The room had a pleasant decor, but the bathroom was bordering on grim: cleaned yes but the ceiling had peeling paint which made the room feel scruffy.

I also think wi-fi in the room shouldn't be a big deal nowadays: still a wires connection at extortionate rates although you can go down to the lobby to access a free service.

I don't like Starbucks and we didn't like the look of either restaurant so we went across the street - there's a wide range of alternatives if you feel the same.

Hall smelled awful, but room not too bad. Asked for extra \"febreeze\" treatment which helped. For some reason we didn't get maid service after the 2nd night, and had to call to get clean towels delivered. Complimentary wifi with Club Carlson membership. The junior suite was basically two tiny rooms with an open connecting door (in fact there were two entry doors into hall). Room 1 had bathroom, closet, twin sofa sleeper, desk, TV, mini fridge, climate control. Room 2 had bathroom (identical) queen bed, closet, tiny dresser, TV, climate control. On 5th floor facing 48th St. but traffic noise wasn't bad -- problem was BOOM BOOM from nightclub a couple of nights. We turned up A/C for white noise which worked. Queen bed was comfortable with nice linens, sofa not so much. Bathrooms tiny but fairly modern. Even though very clean, room had an \"icky\" feel. Carpet was wavy, shades sort of stained, woodwork looked like it had 50 coats of paint, electrical outlets loose, and closets were the worst but adequate to hang up your clothes I guess.

The new room was a bit bigger and had a king size bed with sleep number mattress. If I did not have to pay the extra, I would be quite satisfied with the room, though nothing about this hotel is shiny or new. On the contrary, the bathroom definitely seemed to be in need of upgrade. Having said all that, this hotel has a great location. It is within walking distance from Times Square, Rockefeller Center and within three blocks from the Grand Central station. Another major plus is having Starbucks inside the hotel. There is also a 24 hrs pharmacy within one block and liquor store across the street. Also, there are places to eat within walking distance in every direction.

I requested a room on an upper level, we were given a room on the third floor (second floor, really), directly above a night club with music thumping until 4am. 2. When we checked in there was only a sheet on the bed. I called three times and an hour and a half later (9:30pm), still no blankets. Finally, I had to go downstairs and refuse to leave the counter without a blanket in order to get one. I was given a stained, \u201cdown\u201d duvet that had been washed and dried so much it was just a duvet cover filled with hard balls of feathers. 3. I was in the bathtub one night, which is about three feet away from the door, and a hotel employee used her key and walked right into our room without knocking (for no reason, we had not requested anything, it was 8pm) and saw me in allmy glory. Not good. 4. I found a dried out/crusty wash cloth under the bed????? Yeah, my thoughts exactly. 5. We weren\u2019t given any wash cloths until our last day there.

Sadly, it probably had availability due to the bad points below\u2026 The bad: I wouldn\u2019t rate this hotel as \u2018terrible\u2019 as I save this rating only for the truly appalling. I think I\u2019ll go with poor. These are my top 5 reasons why: 1. It\u2019s expensive and for similar fees you can stay somewhere far better in NY. The only reason I didn\u2019t was because I left it too late to book and so nothing else was available for long stay \u2013 my own fault.

Everything about this hotel is old. The bed sheets are far too old, stained, dry cleaned to death with holes or rips\u2026etc. The exact same thing goes for the towels. I got my own. The carpet is old. The elevators are old. All the furniture is old. Everything is worn and needs a massive refurbishment. The amenities are old. 3. The bathroom is sub-standard. There was no air vent, it was small, the running water felt filthy given the prehistoric age of the plumping. And the bathroom fixtures\u2026rusted, limescaled, worn \u2026screaming out \u2018renovation\u2019. 4. The windows are not double glazed. I was on the 20th floor and could still hear cars beep, police cars, ambulances, fire trucks\u2026etc. The hotel is on a busy junction in mid-town and this drove me absolutely nuts. If you are on the first few floors facing the road, pack earplugs. 5. Room temperature gauge was ineffective which meant it was either freezing cold, or it was like a sauna.

We were given a really nice room on the 26th (top) floor and it was fabulous. No problem with cleanliness or water pressure or noise and I am picky! I checked everything and it was all good! I do think that they are willing to accomodate their guests if they aren't too full and I don't doubt that maybe some of the other rooms are run down and need renovated on other floors. I would definitely just ask to be moved to a renovated, different room on a higher floor. Hopefully they will be willing and able to help you. We were lucky too because we had reserved a deluxe room, which was fairly standard I think, but it seemed to be a step up from basic. I got this at a great price through Groupon.

The bedding was not clean and looked like it was 10 yrs old. This is one of the very few times that I would not sleep under the bedding in a hotel (and I have stayed in hotels all around the world). The hallway smelled of smoke, but at least that diverted my attention from the filthy carpets. There is no lobby to speak of, which is a problem for biz travellers. The only worthwhile aspect of this hotel was the starbucks attached to it. It's so bad that I've had my company's travel service remove this place from our list of approved hotels.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cgood position\u201d", "Author": "TillyJ6", "ReviewID": "UR119901553", "Content": "We stayed at the Radisson Lexington for 4 nights 20-23rd October, we were in room 616.

I waited for over a half an hour for someone to come out and show me and nobody came out until I asked what was taking so long despite the fact I told them I posted regular reviews on Trip Advisor. I think they were hoping I would leave. I watched the front desk and while there were lots of people checking in I was not impressed with the attention paid to patrons at the front desk by the staff. When someone did come out she was very pleasant and we took the elevator to a room. The condition of the hallways and the carpeting on the way to the room was disgusting and filthy.

I was a little surprised, particularly for a radisson to also experience the following: (1) Business Centre: it may be open 24 hours but it is merely an internet cafe with printing capabilities from the Radisson computer terminals. There is nowhere to sit and work on your own laptop, connect to printers or scanners etc. You also have to put up with literally queues of people trying to get onto the existing terminals (in case you wanted to sit down at one of the desks to use your own laptop). There is no-where to sit to discuss issues or have a mini meeting with your colleagues away from the loud lobby music. The hotel suggested that we hold meetings in my bedroom (which, given that I'm a femle is not really acceptable). The best the hotel could offer us was access to one of their business meeting rooms at $70 an hour. (2) Wifi: The free wifi (available only in the lobby) is very weak and despite sitting right next to the router, our wifi would drop out regularly to \"limited or no conectivity\". To have any other wifi or to have access elsewhere in the hotel is $40 per day. (3) Service: I dealt quite a bit with the front desk staff, bell boys and concierge over my 5 day stay and surprising for a Radisson, I have to say they were quite sullen and unhelpful. I'm used to \"American\" service in NY - even the staff at Starbucks next door were friendlier! (4) Rooms: are tiny. I had a queen size room and it must have been about 20m2. The beds are also very hard - but that's an issue of personal taste.

We had used Priceline so they could've said \"Sorry, no changes\" but they didn't. The rate was excellent, and LOCATION perfect. The hotel is about 5 easy blocks from Grand Central Terminal, & several other subway stops are right up Lexington so getting anywhere is a breeze. It's easy to walk to Times Square, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick's Cathedral. Lots of restaurants/bars are located a short walk away on 2nd and 3rd Avenues, and we enjoyed breakfast at the little deli across the street every morning.

Please read all of this!\u201d", "Author": "Chrisla2082", "ReviewID": "UR115228005", "Content": "Let me start by saying that I've written a lengthy report of our experience if you are interested, but if you are one of those who prefers a shorter review.... This hotel was awful. As I've detailed below, the rooms are old and have obviously not been checked for quality (see below), only some contain the \"Sleep Number\" beds that Radisson boasts, the management is horrible and treats you as though \"you should be lucky we let you stay here\" attitude if you book on sites such as Priceline, and is an overall terrible experience. I am not one of those that looks for much out of a hotel besides a comfortable bed, good service, and cleanliness, but this hotel does not have any of them! Our first image of the hotel was an extraordinarily busy lobby (about 2:00pm on a Thursday) with only one guest service attendant. After a short wait (totally unacceptable for a desk that could accommodate 3-4 GS Reps) we were called over to a small desk by an Asian female who we were later told was a manager on duty. She checked us in silently accept to ask for my ID and credit card. I jokingly said that is was my birthday so please make sure I have a great room to which she responded with a sarcastic (ha ha) and kept silently about her business. My partner and I were lifelessly directed to the elevators and entered a very small room that had 1 very small double bed when the reservation was made for two people. I called down to ask about changing to a larger room. The phone was answered by the same lifeless personality that checked us in, and after expressing my issue, she asked for my room number and what my room number was and that she would return my call momentarily. During the next ten minutes we looked around the room only to find paint peeling from the ceiling and a not so pleasant smell. After my call went un-returned (10 minutes later) I called the desk, was answered by the same lifeless personality and was told I would again be given a call back - all with no answer to my complaint. This time the call was returned after about 2 minutes. I was told that because I booked through Priceline, I automatically got the smallest room despite my reservation being for two. However, she would, \"as a courtesy\", upgrade the room if there was something available. After two more five minute waits I was told that all larger beds were sold out for the evening but to check back later that night. Having worked in the hotel industry before an knowing that this is a common falsity I checked the Radisson websites availability for the evening an low and behold it had queens and kings available. My partner asked to speak with the general manager , and explained not only our issue about the room, but also the fact that we were lied to. This gentlemen (which I will identify as being of Middle Eastern or Indian decent) apologized for the lie by saying that previous manager only had limited access to the hotel's availability and that's was the reason for the inconsistency. Instead of handling the remainder of the issue himself, he stood by while he had a gentlemen he introduce as his \"assistant\" checked availability (he did however step in to say that if he was given the opportunity to make money off of us he would do what he could) and then once larger rooms were found he offered to upgrade the room for a fee! We explained the previous offer for a courtesy upgrade and he replied that he didn't know why she would offer this and that he would need to call her. At this point he disappeared into a back room. His assistant Michael followed him and returned saying that he would process our courtesy upgrade. We were then told to leave our original keys in the room after \"moving our things as soon as possible.\" Upon exiting the original room, a housekeeper in the hall asked if we had \"messed anything up in the room\" with the connotation that she did not want to go in and clean it. He apologized and stated that the only room he had available to upgrade us to was on the noisiest level of the hotel. We accepted and were sent to a room that had a foul odor and a 5 inch square hole in the wall's vent paneling that blocked the electrical system. ( Prime exposure for bugs, rats dust, etc.) As if that were not bad enough we the ledge outside was covered with cigarette butts! We of course felt uncomfortable in this room and notified the manager again by phone, and were told to wait so he could come down and see what I was talking about. After another 10 minute wait we went upstairs to find him sitting at the desk talking to other guests. He changed the room to another on the same level which, as I tried to enter, was blocked by the housekeeper's closet left open with a broom. After she closed the door, we entered the room to be greeted by an even worse foul odor (smelled like a dumpster had been emptied), a dirty stained window, and a view cinder blocks, and loud air conditioning units. After returning to the desk, we were given a fourth room room on the hotel's top floor *which takes to elevators to get to). The room was much better with the exception of the chipped paint on the bathroom fixtures,missing handles on the dressers, broken iron, and incomplete towel set (which we had to wait about 35 minutes for to be replaced) As it was my birthday, and more than two hours after our arrival, we chose to ignore these things and kept the room. The remainder of our stay was filled with inconveniences and overheard constant complaints of others: 1. When we left and returned to our room, our keys did no longer worked and had to take 2 trips on the 2 elevator ride to the top level to get back to our room. 2. We heard several other guests complain about false charges, $100 hikes in rate to extend their stays, and one guest even expressed that his hair dryer was sparking and he felt unsafe during his stay. During checkout, that I could not wait for!! I waited about 10 minutes at the again under-manned desk, while the Middle Eastern rude manager who disappeared and never returned the day before stood and watched the slow progression of guests checking out. I was asked about my stay, and explained my problems only to be told that nothing could be done to accommodate me because I booked with Priceline, but that I should have a nice day!

Bell hops are non-intrusive and ask you if you need help or not, without the angle for a tip. Check-in is fast. Honestly that was the best thing about the place. The \"cons\" - Value - Bathrooms could be improved. The toilet is like one of the models you see in an airport washroom.. a manual flush with a big steel handle on the side. You know the kind. - No separate soap for shower and sink - Key cards may stop working and will need to be refreshed - Thin walls/doors; I could hear those coming and going and talking quite easily from my room (and I was not near an elevator) - During the day, I could hear the noise from the street quite easily, although I was > 10 floors up. The whistle from the bellhop for example. Pros - Friendly staff - Location (starbucks connects to lobby) and Grand Central not a far walk - Clean - Informal vibe All in all a serviceable stay.

All I would say against the room was that it was a bit cold for me and took a long time to get warm when I came back to the hotel at night, then the switchover from \"just warm\" to \"stuffy\" was very quick so then I turned the heating off and woke up cold in the morning. Perhaps an extra blanket would have helped! I also echo what previous posters have said about there being a lack of tea and coffee making facilities and very few plug sockets. Also the furniture was a little tired. However, I wasn't disturbed by any noise, the staff were helpful and there were no bedbugs! Which I had been paranoid about before arriving in New York due to all the news lately about them. So despite the cold I would stay again. With one warning... when it came to billing I was billed the cost of the room and then also the cost of the room plus a $200 \"pre-authorisation\" fee. According to the Radisson Lexington accounts dept. my (Irish) bank should have treated this as one transaction in two parts, but as it treated it as two transactions I was effectively billed twice, although the second payment will eventually come back to me.

The room was very small but we has expected that due to it being in the centre of New York. The hotel itself and the room that we stayed in was well decorated but not very clean which is a shame because that let it down a lot and could easilly be rectified. The heating system in the room was very noisey and even when we turned it off we still couldn't sleep because it was still very loud. Although we didnt see any, we suspect that there was bed bugs in our room as after a couple of days I had a few very large itchy marks on my legs! I know this is common in New York but it's still not what you would expect from a 4 star hotel. What was most disappointing about the hotel was that on our last day we recieved a sheet of paper which was posted through the bottom of our door it stated we owed money and that it would be charged to our credit card, it did not say what the money was for. When we checked out we queried what the charge was for and we were told by the receptionist that it was for drinks that we had in the hotel bar. We explained that we had not had any drinks in the bar and that there must be some mistake! The receptionist apologised and said she had removed the charge. On return when my husband checked our credit card statement he noticed that we had been charged!! We e-mailed the hotel asking them to refund the money and we have still not heard anything from them!!! Very disappointed!! and for that reason we would not recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clifton Park, New York", "Title": "\u201cHotel was just right for our stay\u201d", "Author": "shoes1965", "ReviewID": "UR101673390", "Content": "We got this hotel on Priceline for $120.

I still feel that it was a good deal for $200, in NYC. The location was excellent. We arrived by train at Grand Central station which was a 5 minute walk away. The common areas of the hotel are very impressive with a lovely lobby. Times Square, Central Park , Rockefeller Center, Chrylser Building, St. Patrick's Cathedral were all less than 20-25 minutes away by foot. Desk staff was surprisingly aloof when we checked in, but because our stay was short, only one night, it didn't matter. The room we ended up with was plenty large enough with 2 bathrooms which was great. It was clean with modern amenities, but they had missed some details during renovation. For example, paint and paper were peeling in places and paint on the trim was chipping in some areas. None of this was enough to bother us. What did bother us was the bed. They had sleep number beds which some folks might like, but it was incredibly uncomfortable for us, and caused me to have a terrible night's sleep. We ate breakfast at a deli across the street which was awesome. We made the decision to stay clear of the onsite restaurant due to steep prices. Having Starbucks in the hotel was a definite plus for my husband who is a huge fan. Overall, our stay was great and we have no major complaints.

The lobby is very impressive and all the staff so friendly and helpful; not only that, but it is clean and well looked after. It was busy which is always a good sign and had a good vibrant atmosphere. The hotel managers were close by at reception and so friendly and helpful which, again, I think says a lot about the class of hotel. I had only booked a petite room and so was expecting a very small room - however it was what i would call a normal size and very neat and tidy with fantastic views. It was also very clean with good decor. Perfect for what my mum and I needed on our NY shopping trip! Handily there was an adjoining Starbucks and Raffles cafe to the hotel which made early morning jetlag barable. But i'm yet to get to the bonus points of this hotel... The location! Amazing. Right next to Lexington avenue, it is perfect for shopping, sight seeing and within easy reach of the subway if you want to go further. The hotel were very helpful in advising good places to eat and drink, although a couple of nights we had room service and ate at the hotel's own restaurant which was also very good.

Other things were great. The location is out of this world. Only blocks to Grand Central Station, Rockefeller Plaza, Times Square and other great sights. The lobby is very nice. When I checked in they said they were upgrading me to a Jr. Suite 'just because.' That ended up coming in handy as my family was joining me a couple of days later. So far, I am very happy. Upon first exam, the room was just plain old and plain. The carpet was threadbare indoor/outdoor carpet. The bathroom had super old fixtures and a badly stained bathtub. The couch cushions were extremely stained. There was however a large HD flatscreen TV and nice king size bed. I got in the bed and pumped up the Sleep Number bed and watched a little tube. No problems. Until 3 am when I woke up 'in a hole.' The sleep number bed had deflated and wouldn't go back up! Ugh. It worked this way sporadically throughout the trip. When my family joined on Saturday night we couldn't even begin to relax as the club two doors down BLASTED hip hop music that was literally FELT as well as heard. It had already started around 10p when we arrived back in our room. We 'took it' for about an hour and then I called guest services to complain. She nonchalantly said it was gonna go on until 4am and then hung up on me! I immediately called the manager who came to our room to discuss with us. She was very helpful in 'trying' to remedy, but of course the hotel was oversold and there was no where to move us. So, we were stuck, along with our neighbors who popped their heads out to complain as well. She promised to call the club and complain. It must have worked because around 1am the music miraculously stopped and we were able to sleep. The manager graciously gave us free breakfast during our stay which was nice, esp. since we wouldn't have eaten at Raffles to save our lives since a simple breakfast of 2 eggs, toast and coffee was $18.95! So, I hear the price of this place is better than many. Just make sure you are on a high floor (away from the club) and make sure you get a remodeled room and you will be fine.

Go to Stardust Diner for breakfast (opposite Novotel on Times Square)...the waiters/waitresses sing while serving! Get free ferry to Staten Island for great views on Statue of Liberty.

My boyfriend and I are fairly young so wanted to enjoy some night life whilst in New York and thought it would be ideal to go the club but everytime we went to go we were told we could not enter because of a private party. We found the bar staff really helpful when deceiding where to go for dinner at night and the restaurant across the road was out of this world, we would definatley pay it a visit if I returned to New York.

The reviews were mixed, some not too good, but I booked there anyways. I hope my feedback will be taken seriously and management can see ways where they can improve on the little things that may make or break a customer's decision on a return stay to the hotel. The check-in process was OK for the most part. I think the clerks at the counter should show a little more enthusiasm and helpfulness when welcoming the guests upon check-in. I did not get that from the young hispanic guy that eventually checked me into the first room. Customer Service goes such a long way when it's managed properly. To summarize, all in all my stay turned out to be quite enjoyable, I slept well after changing rooms for the third time. The first room, the phone message system and the toilet did not work properly. Thanks to the Senior Engineer whose first intial start with the letter \"J\", who went above and beyond to ensure that the toilet and the phone was fixed after I rang so many times about the same problems. The last room I was switched to did not have a properly functioning toilet either. I'm not sure what the problems are at the Radisson regarding this vital amenity, however, it was frustrating to have to be ringing down to the operator to complain about the same thing over and over. Front Desk Manager whose initials are N.S, I want to thank you for all that you've done to turn things around and making our staying an enjoyable one after all. My daughter commented too that you were an extremely patient and pleasant person to deal with, as well you had a smile on your face all the time. The location was quite ideal and the food at the restaurants attached to the hotel was great! We will return for any future stay.

This was our first travel together without out children in 7 years so we had been looking forward to this stay for a while (We're both in our early thirties). When we checked in (30/7) we were informed that we could only get a small room to start with as everything was fully booked but if we were not satisfied we could get a larger room the following morning. When we got up to the 15th floor we saw that our room wasn't that big but we weren't planning on staying in the room all that much so that was something we could have lived with. Our bed was however only a 1,5 x single size which was far too small for us to sleep comfortably in. After a sleepless night, mainly caused by lack of a bed suitable for 2 grownups + noises from the next bedroom (but you could literally hear everything that went on there, which gave you the feeling you were on a cheap model in stead of a Radison) we went down to the lobby to ask for a new room. The employee that assisted us that morning was extremely rude and basically said that we could not get another room and she doubted that the employee who checked us in had promised that. She furthermore stated that this was a full size bed in spite of our claims. I asked if this was a king size but she just repeated herself by saying this was a full size. We were little amazed by the treatment we got but in stead of making troubles (which we should have done) we decided to try to enjoy our first day in NY and try too see whether we could find a little less hostile employee in the afternoon. When we got back we were informed that we could try to check again in the morning, which we did. The third time we got down we were informed that we could at the very first get a larger room on the 2nd-3rd of August and it would going to cost us extra money. This employee acknowledged that this was neither a king size nor a queen size. After that we sort of gave up from the idea of getting a larger room and decided to stick with this one. There are several other things worth mentioning, 1) during the day and nights it got really warm in the room so we decided to turn on the air-conditioner ....if you are interested in having a conversation or watch the TV when its on then rather accept the heat, it's was abnormally noisy when the air-conditioning was on 2) if you decide to close the bathroom door when showering, make sure that you have a partner with you on the other side or a mobile to call for help as our door alway got shut due to the moisture and needed to be lightly \"kicked in\" by the other individual 3) there is a gap between the floor and the door to the bedroom so you hear everything at all hours from the corridor, the gap was around 4 cm where largest. 4) The safe did not work 5) We bathroom was messy once we arrived and had obviously not been cleaned well enough, we e.g. saw a pubic hair in the tub before we used it. The hotel had one good thing that one cannot complain about but the location was excellent, you are very well centered in Manhattan and many locations are in walking range. Coming from Scandinavia I've stayed several times in Radision in more then 4 countries. I've always been pleased but this was a very bad experience and I would rather recommend couples to stay in a different hotel. We paid for this stay with bonus points from the airline I do most business with but I don't know if that was the reason for the treatment we got. I used tripadvisor before we booked our stay and also checked the homepage of the hotel. The general manager of the hotel comments every review in this forum which gave me a comfort but you could read a large number of dissatisfied customers, his comments gave you the notion that if one was not pleased every measures would be taken to address the problem. As previously described than that is not our experience of the hotel so if you decide to stay then embrace yourselves for a bad experience.

When I received my credit card account I realized that they changed the room rate to $309. Now they refuse to discuss this with me and I have already instructed a lawyer to act on this.

My only issue upon being dropped off was the large number of people sitting and standing out front of the hotel smoking. You had to walk through a deep wave of smoke just to get to the revolving door. Of course, there's little a hotel can do about guests smoking out front, but it wasn't very welcoming. The check-in was very smooth and the staff at the reception desk were very professional and friendly. A+ The room itself was TINY. The bed was comfortable and there was little noise from the street below. The bathroom could use an update. The grout was discolored, the tiles were coming away from the wall, etc. It just looked like it got a half-renovation a number of years ago, and then they forgot about it.

The room was basic but not a bad size for inner city hotels - bigger than one we had in London last year. The room was very clean and although obviously well used it was not too tired looking. Massive TV. Even with the window open the daytime street noise was not awful, although we slept with the window closed as the weather was cool. There was plenty of space to store clothes and a safe too for the valuable bits and bobs! There was a little noise from next rooms and corridor but as a light sleeper I was not troubled by it. Plenty of places to eat close by from sushi to chops and a good store across the street open 24 hours. Also great for transport links with bus, train and subway really close by and loads of tourist attractions within easy walking distance. When organising transport back to Newark airport for our return the concierge service was really helpful giving us plenty of information and prices for all our option. We decided on an executive taxi which they booked for us which made the system run smoothly. The bell boy will also take bags for the day $2 per bag which we found brilliant as we had a night flight.

There was no extractor fan in the bathroom so got very hot and stuffy, I presume that was why it was moldy.

That was a big mistake. - When I arrived,the first room I was given was already in use by somebody else! I walked into the room to find a shocked German guy asking what I was doing in his room. - The second room I was given had not been cleaned, and there were some unpleasant crusty green stains on the sheets! The room had a small sign by the phone saying \"If you have any problems or requests, please call 8444. You will get immediate attention.\" (or something similar). I called, and nobody answered, forcing me to go back downstairs, only to once again be offered a different room. (The receptionist mumbled \"second time today\" to a colleague after I told her the problem). - The third room seemed okay, until: a) I noticed there were no towels in the bathroom. I called 8444 (this time answered) and was told some would be sent up. After waiting an hour, I tried to call again, but once again, no answer. So I had to go downstairs to reception, where I was offered an apology, free breakfast during my stay, and promised that towels would arrive in five minutes, which they finally did. b) I got into bed later that evening, to hear the [drip] [drip] [drip] of water from the air conditioning onto the carpet next to the bed. By this point, I was so sick of changing rooms that I just switched it off, leaving the room a little too hot, but at least quiet. The hotel's website also boasts about its \"Complimentary high-speed, wired and wireless Internet\", which helped to persuade me to stay there. Despite this, there is nothing complimentary about it - it actually costs about $10 per day. I tried to call 8444 to enquire, but again, no answer. So, another trip to reception, to be told that nothing could be done about this (\"change of company policy, I'm afraid\"). Only after complaining to a different staff member was I was told that the charges could be waived. The instructions on how to use the 'Sleep Number' bed were missing, making the hotel's boasts about these meaningless. I had to sleep on the bed as it came. On the last night, the air con started dripping again (despite being switched off), which I guessed was because the room next door had started using theirs. I had a terrible night's sleep, for which I was told $50 would be knocked off my bill as an apology. Altogether, my stay at this hotel was characterised by one problem after another. The staff are apologetic, and they did provide free breakfast, waive the internet charges, and knock $50 off the final bill.

Our previous hotel had increased their rates dramatically, so we were looking for a hotel that was more affordable. We booked this room on the Radisson website and got a rate of around \u00a3150 a night without breakfast. As the prices were high and it is a Radisson hotel, we thought it would be pretty good, but the only good thing about it was the location. It is located on 48th street, so takes about 20 mintues to walk to Central Park and about 30 mintues to Times Suare, plus there are subway stations very close. In terms of the hotel, we arrived about an hour before check in, and most hotels would normally get you checked in early, especially as this hotel has over 700 rooms. They did not, so therefore we had to store our bags and pay $2 per bag, they tried to even charge for a small bag which we attached to a suitcase, so just took it off and paid for the 2 suitcases. When we checked in, the hotel we were given was on the 17th floor, and faced Lexington Avenue. The room was a petite room, and they were not joking, a very small double bed, desk and drawers, plus the rooms needed a bit of TLC, especially the bathrooms. We spent 1 night in this room, in which we got no sleep due to the noisy Lexington Avenue. The windows let in so much noise!!! The next day we asked to move rooms, which they said was possible between 3pm and 6pm and was told we would have a room on the 23rd floor facing the back of the hotel where it is quieter. At 5.30pm we went back to Reception to sort this out, and they were not able to do this at this time, and said we needed to wait another hour. At 6.30 we were called in our room and were told we could now change rooms, so had to head back to Reception and sort it out. The next room ended up being on the 21st floor, and was facing the back of the hotel which was a lot quieter, however the bed was uncomfortable, as the matress sunk into the middle from both sides, and everytime you moved even a little bit it squeaked. Also, room and bathroom was tidy and clean, but the inside window was very dirty and had not been cleaned for a long time as you can see from the dirt on my fingers in picture i added.

We will be coming back to New York and will be staying at this hotel again. Another complaint I read was about the noise. We were on the 17th floor and, while we didn't have much of a view, we had no noise from the night club next door and only minimal street noise. It's the \"city that never sleeps\" people!! Even the Plaza has street noise! If you're a light sleeper you may want to include ear plugs (this goes for any hotel in NYC).

Breakfast included, you do have a different menu however there is still a selection to chose from, my husband had a cooked breakfast every day, juice, toast and coffee. Our room was on the 8th floor and we were over the air conditioning unit outside, however, this did not disturb us in the night and we had a good nights sleep. We did not have dinner in the hotel, but there is a marvellous Indian restaurant The Maharaja on 133 East 45th Street. Exit through Sarbucks, turn left and walk for a couple of blocks and turn left onto East 45th Street the restaurant is on your left. We ate there 4 times in a week, supberb food and prices. Do not be put off by the decor, it is very small but very friendly. They did not have any Chardonnay wine one night, they asked me to write down the wine I wanted and they went out and bought a bottle, where else would you get service like that. A marvelous selection available, including a dinner special for $12.95, choose 1 appetizer or 1 soup or 1 salad, plus 2 entrees 1 vegetable, 1 chicken or meat, includes nan bread and papadam. Hotel only 5 minutes walk from Grand Central Station and even closer to 51st Street. Buses available 42nd street for crosstown and 2nd Avenue for downtown. One great tip is to buy a weekly unlimited Metro Ticket if you are there for a week, unlimited travel on subway and buses for $27. Just swipe the card each time you use it, and buy it at any subway station. For those on their first trip to NY you ideally need a metro ticket for travel on the subway and buses, as the buses only accept correct fare for each trip $2.25. Just go to the nearest subway station and you can by them at the machine, you can buy a variety of tickets so there will be one to suit you. A really nice treat is to have a private car back to the airport, just see the Bell Capain and he will arrange it all for $60. Taxi from the airport is $45 plus tolls so not much difference in price. Found the service in the hotel very good, and the free internet access in the Business Centre is excellent, especially if you need to check in on line for your return flight. We flew with British Airways during the strike, a bad experience as they cancelled our return flight but did not think to tell us!!!! The internet access helped us enormously to arange new flights and keep an eye on the flight to ensure it was not cancelled again.

On leaving JFK we went outside to look for a taxi, a word of warning to first time travellers to NYC, take a taxi from the rank and not from someone who says their cab is parked in the car park nearby, they are legitimate cabs but will over charge you. We payed $120 dollars for an old rattle wagon from the airport and $60 for a limo back to the airport. On our arrival the reception staff were friendly and efficient. The luggage staff were like Jack Flash, if a bit miserable, but to be honest we found this to be the case of most New Yorkers we met, they made you feel like you were inconveniencing them just by being there. The room was smaller than some hotels, but for the money it was clean, well appointed and more than adequate for our stay. We were in room 2624 on the 26th floor, so we missed most of the traffic noise, we were by the lift however, which was a bit noisey through the night, we were so tired it didnt really bother us, but it may be a problem for light sleepers. The bed was amazing, fabulously comfy and it had a gizmo attached to it where you could adjust the firmness of your mattress. The bathrooms are small but adequate. The hotel has a couple of restaurants, Raffles is nice but a bit expensive, there's an all you can eat diner accross the road where you can get much better value for money. We didnt venture into the cocktail lounge, but it looked really cosy. The hotel is ideally situated, just at most a 20 minute walk to many points of interest such as Grand Central, Chrysler Building, Times Square, Empire State etc. If you are a first time traveller to NYC as we were, there is a help desk in the lobby, the staff there are really helpfull and will point you in the general direction of any tours you wish to go on. We chose the Redline Bus Tours, its a 36hr ticket, where you can get on and off at various points of interest. Its good value, but look out for the English guide, he's much friendlier and much more knowledgeable than the others we came across (more miserable New Yorkers unfortunatley). If you wish to see a show during your stay, you can get tickets for the older shows at the ticket office under the big red staircase in Times Square for a fraction of the price if you book direct at the theatre or at your hotel. But be prepared to queue. For any of the newer shows, such as the Lion King or Billy Elliot or Wicked, its probably better to book online before you go as these are mostly sold out by the time you get there. If you go for a pre breakfast stroll around Central Park, as we did, and are looking for a good value breakfast, try Angelas Deli at Central and 6th, nothing special inside, but you get as good a breakfast as anywere else but for $6.00, pretty good when you can pay up to $25.00 each at a lot of other establishments. All in all we enjoyed our visit to NYC, the New Yorkers arnt a very friendly bunch, but the hotel was great and the staff in the main were lovely, we would certainly stay there again.

It was definitely in need of better insulation and sound-proofing, however I have found this in many areas of NYC, and I could have complained and moved rooms but chose not to. 2- The only other Con was regarding the food. We ordered two warm bread puddings from room service one night and they were both served cold. Also, the service at the Sung Dynasty restaurant was horrendous. We arrived at 9pm for dinner, and they said that \"Of course\" they were still serving, and led us to our seats. Our server was very rude, and the whole wait staff sat around staring at us impatiently waiting for us to finish our meals so they could go home. We felt this was odd and uncalled for, considering they were supposed to be open until 10:30pm. Anyway, we rushed through our meals and literally threw back our bottle of wine because we were so uncomfortable. Now, the Pro's: Other than the things listed above, our stay was fantastic! From the bellman, to the concierge, to the front desk attendants, to the maid service, the staff at this hotel really made our stay! Literally every staff member that we encountered was kind, helpful, gracious, and willing to do whatever needed to be done to accommodate us. Also, given that I had to change my reservation several times prior to arrival, I fully expected to have some problems once we arrived, however, everything was in order and fully taken-care-of. We even got a room upgrade. This was a breath of fresh air for a weary traveler. It is because of this level of customer service, and the value of the rooms for the price and location, that we will return. The rooms were really very nice for such a great price in NYC, especially in that location.

This was our first time in NY and despite several people offering their own advice and hotel experiences, we opted to book via the web. We chose the Lexington. We arrived around 2pm, with the Bell-boy taking our bags approx 15ft from the kerb side to just pass the rotating door and stood with his hand out, telling us that he was finished for the day and we were to have a nice day! So, rather than engage in a dispute over the merits of his efforts ( or lack of) 2 dollars were deposited in his gloved palm. Booked in and the room wasn't ready, although it does say 3pm check-in, it would appear that they can't or won't budge on early entry into your room. After a 7hr flight, it would have been nice. So rather than wait, we left our bags with the Bell Captain and went out for the day! There is a Satrbucks on site right on Lexington, but there are no seats within, although you can take your coffee into the Hotel Lobby. When we finally got in our room, it was tiny for a double. Now, as I say this is the first time I have been in NY, but it was a small double bed, with a 42 inch plasma TV approx 2 feet from the side of our bed. A small cupboard ( smelled damp) for clothes with an easy to use safe-FREE!! The bathroom was ok but nothing special. We were 22 floors up, it has 27. The noise at night and early morning was incredible. The wind howled through the ill-fitting windows, and this was not double glazing at it's best-every sound for some reason was magnified. The problem is, once your settled in, it really feels like more of a hassle to start complaining and moving. The concierge staff were helpful, but DO NOT PURCHASE TICKETS FOR A SHOW. The mark-up is 100% and in fairness they tell you, but just shrug their shoulders. The location is ok, your one block down from the Waldorf and 3 blocks from the Chrsyler building.

While I was there the staff was wonderful. I was given a fantastic room,a corner room with a lovely view. The location was fabulous. The staff were friendly. It was quiet. All was well. Problem was I started to develop itching and strange bumps on my arms and legs and back that were harder and darker than mosquito bumps. In all my world travels, I had never seen or felt anything quite like it. I went to the doctor after and he said they were definitely bed bug bites! I wrote to the hotel to notify them and they wrote back saying that they \"checked\" and found nothing of the sort. I should add that they offered me an upgrade for my next stay, but I didn\u2019t find being eaten by bedbugs in a bigger room, to be compelling in the least and found it to be a very strange offer in light of the lack of promise to get rid of the bedbugs! Thus, needless to say, I found the manager's response to be fairly unsatisfactory, but I didn\u2019t want to get into a drawn out battle, so I let it go. I was SO relieved that I didn't bring any of those things back home, or I would have been livid! I'm writing a full year later because I am returning to New York for the same UN meeting and I was looking for my hotel. I wondered if maybe I had been wrong to tar the entire Radisson with the same brush (mostly wishful thinking because they were so nice otherwise, the location is perfect and the price was right). I was hoping that maybe it was just the person who stayed before me and the situation was isolated to that room and perhaps, in spite of their denial, the Radisson subsequently corrected the situation after my complaint,(after all what hotel would say, \"Ah yes, as a matter of fact we DO have bedbugs.\"). So I googled \"Radisson Lexington NYC\" and \"bedbugs\" and found numerous sites where folks reported finding bedbugs at the very same hotel! :-( Thus, I felt compelled to add my experience to the chorus in hopes that they will actually admit the problem and do something about it because I would love to return! I'm glad to see through the positive reviews that some others have managed to avoid the bedbug afflicted rooms so that I know it's not a universal issue throughout the hotel. However, i don't want to roll the dice unless I know they have done large scale fumigation and laundering or whatever it takes for bedbug eradication, because two weeks is a long time to be chewed on by those critters. :-) I'm advising the same to my many friends and colleagues who are looking for lodging for the upcoming UN Commission on the Status of Women.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, N.

The heating in the room remained high above 70F all one night through the next morning, making us sweaty and thirsty, losing sleep. When we requested a different room the next morning, the front desk told us that the room will not be ready until 12:00 pm. We could not wait in the same room because it was too hot. We were told, however, that there was nothing they could do until 12:00 pm. The front desk also explained that there was only one technician for the entire hotel to check on heating. We waited for more than one hour for the technician. When there finally came a technician, however, there were two technicians. The technicians could not yet do their job because our baby had just fallen off into a slumber. There also came a cleaning crew knocking on the door, with our room on their list for \"check-out\", waking up the baby. We spoke to \"Nancy\", the front desk manager(a Thai woman), that we needed to move out immediately. \"Nancy\" became very irate for no reason, banging and knocking her computer keyboard. We almost thought she was going to break her keyboard. \"Nancy\" told us that there was no room available next to an ice machine area. We had given a mere indication of our preference to stay next to an ice machine area, only it was a possibility. \"Nancy\", however, made it sound as though we had made some absolute, \"specific\" request, using it as a reason for lack of availability of any room where we could move into immediately. Moreover, though she had suggested two possible rooms to move into, we had declined because we saw these rooms being of different size and capacity. \"Nancy\", however, kept on insisting that these rooms were of the same size. \"Nancy\" also laughed at us in front of everyone, as if it were ludicrous for us to desire a room next to an ice machine(we desired this for the sake of our baby). \"Nancy\" finally gave us a key to a temporary room for us to stay until 12:00 pm. The key did not work. She gave us a different key with no apology. Our baby was staring at her with a look of bewilderment, if not horror, all this time. This was a totally different image of \"Nancy\" who initially greeted us with a friendly smile and perhaps an overexcitement to see a baby arrive at the hotel. We waited in the temporary room for a new room to get ready. We called \"Nancy\" asking her when the room will be ready. She told us that she had just gone up there to see for herself, and the room was being cleaned at that time to be ready in no time. After 45 minutes, we went up to see the room on our own. There were cleaning staff still working in the room. They told us that they had just started to clean up the room only seconds ago. They also indicated that they could have set up our room much earlier. We moved into the new room. Heating in the new room worked ok, cooling off within one hour after turning it off. This was not consistent, however, with an explanation offered by the hotel's general manager(by the name of \"Don\"). \"Don\" had explained to us earlier that it was because the building was very old that the guests had no control over room temperature once the system gets turned on, suggesting that we therefore needed to admit outside air by opening the window. Doing so, however, would have hurt our baby. This is in the middle of winter, outside snowing. The two technicians also indicated that repair work was necessary for the room we left behind. We called hotel's customer service. \"Don\" called us right back regarding our call to the customer service. I was on the cellphone with my wife, when \"Don\" called in. \"Don\" asked my wife to see if I was in the room. My wife said no. \"Don\" then started yelling at her in a loud, angry and hostile voice. \"Don\" questioned her why we called the customer service. Though we merely reported our experience, \"Don\" accused my wife of making a request for refund of the entire cost of our stay. We did not make any such request. I heard our baby crying and screaming out loud in the back through my cellphone. My wife told \"Don\" that she no longer wished to have any conversation with him. \"Don\", however, yet kept on yelling at my wife that he will not reimburse. I also overheard \"Don\" repeatedly yell at my wife that she can look for another hotel to stay. My baby later vomited and had a diarrhea. Don had earlier indicated that \"Nancy\"'s behavior was \"unacceptable\". Besides a problem with heating, there was also a missed wake-up call. There was also an incident where housekeeping was not done until 5 o'clock in the afternoon, despite our request made at noontime. The bathroom door hinges squeked. A bathroom lightbulb was flickering. An alarm clock was missing. Extra towels did not come. All of these problems took hours and hours to resolve. We were exhausted and exasperated. We also felt scared. Calling me \"sir\" for an unnecessary number of times did not make us feel any better. No amount of apology is enough to compensate for this experience, to be rolled up in one slick word of an \"inconvenience\".", "Date": "February 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "liverpool", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel and location\u201d", "Author": "firebladebill", "ReviewID": "UR55375785", "Content": "i dont know why this hotel gets negative comments, stayed at the radisson for 5 nights with my teenage daughter, we did have a bit of delay checking in because our room wasnt ready, but the staff on rececetion were excellent and gave me free breakfast vouchers for our stay for the inconveniance, rooms are good with free wi fi, very clean hotel great central location very friendly and helpful staff, cant wait to stay again,", "Date": "February 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Clean Hotel and Friendly Staff\u201d", "Author": "TigerCME", "ReviewID": "UR55040847", "Content": "Visited the Radisson whilst on a 5 day trip to New York with my girlfriend.

Firstly you need to bear in mind that this hotel is in New York which I have come to realise does not have the same star rating as other parts of America. The hotels are generally older buildings. Having arrived approximately 45 minutes early we were told that we could check in immediately. The whole process took less than five minutes. Hand over credit card details and collect your key. We were offered assistance with our bags but declined as the lifts were nearby. We were on the floor and easily found our room. Having stayed in New York on previous occasions we were pleasantly surprised with our room (827). It was fairly spacious, more than enough room for two even after my wife has shopped. The bathroom was spotlessly clean although possibly a bit dated but again its New York. Strange air filled beds ......... hours of entertainment........ Although not so good when you neighbours decide to inflate theirs as you can here the fan. The view from our room was limited to some back yards but lets face it how much time do you spend in the room looking out the window. People its New York go and explore, oh and shop. The temperature of the room was very comfortable on the first night and as it had snowed the following day we were concerned about how warm our room would be. This again was not a problem as an extra quilt had been placed in our room should it be required. My wife used it but I was comfortable enough without. The hotel itself is very well located for shopping and sight seeing 5th Ave, Lexington, Times Square, Central Park, everything within walking distance. Personally we did not try the food at the Hotel as there are so many fine places to eat in New York. We did however make regular use of the Starbucks. I did not find the Hotel too noisy, too hot, too cold or even to dirty like some of the other reviews mentioned. The only issues I had was the fact that it stated you could only change $100 of traveller\u2019s cheques. This was not a problem on the first morning as they happily changed more. However the next morning I spoke with a rather abrupt young girl who pointed to a sign stating that it was $100 only. I explained that it had not been a problem the previous day to which she responded that it should only have been $100. She then gave me a $100 bill. I asked if she could change it and she told me that it was all she had. Makes me wonder why I still use traveller\u2019s cheques!!!!! Due to the city being hit by the tail end of a blizzard we were concerned about our flights home. I asked the concierge who immediately logged on to the internet and checked the status of our flight. He then phoned a friend at the airport and explained to us that although the news was reporting doom and gloom this only related to domestic flights and not to international travellers.

The room we were moved to had blistering paint in the bathroom, a carpet that was clearly infused with years of dirt (although it was vacumed well), and the bath was severely chipped. The room was really poor. It reflects very poorly on the hotel as a whole. Without a doubt, the grottiest hotel i have ever stayed in and definitely the worst Radisson i have been in.

Like others I looked at the reviews on Trip Advisor, and was slightly concerned at the some of the negative reviews, though as the trip had already been booked, decided to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt. We caught the Newark Express coach from the airport, which was fantastic, and dropped us at Grand Central Station, a short ten minute walk from the hotel. Upon arrival, the staff were extremely helpful and courteous. We were given a room on the fourth floor and upon inspection, decided that the noise from the air conditioning unit outside may be a problem at night, therefore I asked whether we could switch which was not a problem, and was done immediately. Our second room, was far better. The rooms (dependent on which type you go for) are a cosy size though ample, with flatscreen TVs and a decent sized bathroom. The room was nicely decorated and whilst could do with a lick of paint, not shabby in the slightest. We knew we were in New York and were likely to spend very little time in our rooms. All we wanted was something clean and acceptable, which our room certainly was. At the hotel there is a Starbucks, Raflles Bar and Cafe, a Cuban restaurant, Habana Room and the Lex Lounge & Sushi Bar. I can't tell you about any of them as we never ate in the hotel. That's not to say there is anything wrong with the restaurants at all, we wanted to explore New York and often were still out around meal times so found restaurants near to where we were at the time. For breakfast we found a little cafe, Cafe Metro on Lexington Avenue that was our start point every morning. It sold omelettes, bagels etc. The location of the hotel is absolutely perfect, within easy walking distance of the major attractions, Central Park, Rockefeller Centre, 5th Avenue etc. Grand Central is 5-10 mins walk away for catching a subway train to anywhere in Manhattan, also there is a subway station at Lexington and 53rd Street. We walked to the Empire State Building on the final day, down on 34th Street and this took 20 minutes so still not a major journey I have seen some reviews talking about noise from outside and have to admit there were a few fire engines and police cars passing by on occasion, though was to be expected for New York and did not cause any problem. Most times we were completely exhausted from a day of sightseeing so rarely were awake for long when it came to going to bed!! Overall, I would absolutely recommend the Radisson Lexington to anyone thinking of travelling to New York. The location cannot be beaten, the rooms were clean and adequate, the staff were friendly and helpful and the service could not be faulted.", "Date": "December 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "3", "Value": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cNot as bad as they say\u201d", "Author": "plexiglasss", "ReviewID": "UR50806263", "Content": "I was nervous about this hotel after reading some bad reviews, but it wasn't nearly as bad as I expected.

We had initially booked a double, but when we arrived the very small room was dirty and what was called a double is nothing more than a large single room.

The corner room we stayed in was located on the 7th floor, so we could hear all the noise from the streets and the subway running underneath the hotel. Every night at aroun 4.00 some bass started thumping somewhere and at aroun 7.00 the construction workers across the street started. The first 2 nights our heating was broken, so we complained about it. The heating wasn't fixed, but a duvet was on the bed when we came back to the hotel the 1st night. Finally on the 3rd night someone came and turned our heating on. Unfortunately the heating wasn't adjustable so we had to sleep with a blasting heating on one side and a cold open window on the other and woke with soar throats the next morning. On the 4th night 2 guys had to take apart half our room in order to fix the heating. It seemd someone had slammed a screw through a wire......! The bathroom and room were rather dirty. No one vacuumed during our stay so one couldn't walk without shoes. There was old dust throughout the room and the window panes had never been cleaned. The bathroom was horrible. Very small and with a very low ceiling so everything stays wet all day after a shower. It was also dirty with tiles turning yellow from old soap and a drain that didn't work properly for both the sink and bath tub. Out of the 3 phones in the room only one functioned with hick-ups. All in all we thought it was really not worth the 400 dollars a night with so many flaws.
