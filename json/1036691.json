{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Disappointed Together with my wife we stayed in this hotel in october 2008.Some comments:If you can not read Japanese the hotel is hard to find (sign only in Japanese and small roman sign only readable when you stand in the front of the hotel). Reservation can be made through the internet in English.Hotel is in quiet area. Staff is friendly but do not understand any English. Rooms are clean but furnishing is old.Free internet (LAN) in the room.Very, very small room. No place to put your luggage (not even under the beds). Only one old chair. Small desk with no room for your legs (the small refrigerator is under the desk). Large beds (one bigger than the other in the twin room).Very, very small toilet/bathroom. No view from the window (blind wall/staircase). We were lucky that our room looked at the adjacent outside staircase. This gave my wife a good feeling because it gave an escape route in case of fire (otherwise did this not exists). The good thing on the Hotel: Good location (near Ueno park, shopping, station). (Keep in mind that if you want to go to the station between 11.00 PM and 07.30 AM the elevators/escalators do not work on the flyover so you have to haul your luggage up and down the stairs your selve.) Conclusion: Although the hotel is called Tourist hotel the hotel is not fit for tourist. And the price is far too high for what they offer (yes I know hotel prices in Tokyo are high but I know for a fact that other hotels offer better rooms for a lower price.) The higher price does not offset for the location near the Ueno busy area.", "Date": "Oct 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR598220708", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Butchi"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066461-d1036691-r20950780-Tourist_Hotel-Taito_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1036691", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
