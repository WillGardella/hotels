I have stayed here 3 times and ALL 3 times there was an issue. 1st stay during a heat wave....A/C didn't work, but the heater did and was baking us in our first floor room during our 3 day stay. The advice given: sleep with your windows open....they have \"security\". 2 ladies staying on a bottom floor room that faced the back parking lot, I think not. The manager did end up comp the room but not after having to track him down at the hotel next door since his staff couldn't reach him cause he was \"off the property\" (next door sitting on the couch talking on his cell phone). The hotel changed names from a Quality Suites to Comfort Suites after the 1st stay. I figured it might be going under new management, which I was told it would be. Giving it a 2nd chance, I booked again. 2nd stay: 3 rooms. Booked well in advance and requested first floor rooms next to each other. Specifically stated I didn't want any room(s) in the corner by the back parking lot door or staircase. Called back a month before to verify our reservation was good to go. She gave me the room #'s; one was the corner room. I said, no, that they would need to change that she then gave me a new room # to replace it. We arrived to check in and to my surprise, the corner room was never changed. Forced to spend the night in the room cause they didn't have any others rooms unless I was willing to pay more $$. :/ Next day/night they were to move me...which they did but to the 2nd floor away from my family. At that point, I wasn't going to deal with the staff anymore and was going to enjoy my time with my family. I called upon my return home and spoke with the mngr. Erika for over 2 hours. She was very understanding (at least I thought so) and stated she was making notes in my file; was going to credit me back for half of my stay and give me points to cover a 1 night stay. I was told to contact her if we decided to ever come back. I felt good after our conversation. 3rd stay: Stayed last weekend for 2 days. Called to speak with Erika and from Dec. 2011 to March 2012 not one note was placed under my name. I had to remind her of our 2 plus hour conversation;red flag went up. Once that was figured out and I calmed down I called her back to book the room. We checked in on a Sat. -- came back to our room that night at 8pm and had to deal with a party in the room next door. 11:30pm: Called front desk and was told it's still early for a Sat. night and that the hotel doesn't have a policy against parties. RED FLAG. But that security would address the noise. Noise only got worse - people coming and going from the back parking lot door...front desk had no clue as to how many people were in that room or who was coming and going. RED FLAG. 1:30am: called front desk again, told they would have to call the cops. 2am: Cops show up and clear out the \"extra\" guest. Finally silence and maybe some sleep. :/ Phone in bedroom didn't work; light bulb missing in lamp on night stand in bedroom; water damage to the ceiling/wall/wallpaper peeling off in bedroom; refridge was turned off so all our food went to waste. One can only hope this hotel will change it's policy on parties and having the 2 back door entrances just open for people to go in and out of without a key. Security is a BIG ISSUE...guest safety is not a top priority at this location or to the staff. Plenty of hotels in and around the area...may have to pay more, but if it's for your safety or the safety of your family...won't you spend it?

The party guests take up all of the parking spaces. We returned to the hotel at about 8:30pm on a Saturday night to find no parking spaces. We even checked the lot behind the hotel but there were only a couple of spaces at the dark far end. We might have parked there but people were loitering back there in the dark. We ended up parking in a strip mall with \"Towing for non-customer\" signs everywhere. When we entered the hotel, there was no one at the front desk. We were very un-comfortable about where we had parked and went back down to the front desk after about 20-30 minutes. There were 3 people at the desk and they told us that there would be parking after 11:00 pm when the party had to legally break up. We stayed up to after 11:00 pm and found that party goers were leaving. We then moved our car. The next morning we complained to the front desk when we checked out.

If you are the kind of person that expects a luxury spa hotel, don\u2019t stay here go to the Hotel Del Cornado and pay 5 times more. If you want a clean, safe place with plenty of FREE parking in San Diego, I recommend this hotel. It is 15 minutes away from the zoo, down town, sea world and most everything you want to do on S. D. Lego land is 18 miles away and about 30 to 40 minutes. The staff is nice and the rooms are good. The hotel pool and hot tub is kept nicely. The FREE breakfast was a little better than your standard continental breakfast. Every morning there is at least some form of hot meat and eggs. The coffee is fresh and there is an attendant that takes care of everything. The most disappointing part was the happy hour. Yes, there is free beer and wine, but the \u2018so called\u2019 light dinner consists of chips and salsa. You\u2019d be better off stopping at the many liquor stores or grocery stores and get your own beer or wine because the stuff was CHEAP. This was the ONLY complaint. In the immediate area there are plenty of places to eat and shop \u2013 even an In and Out burger within \u00bd mile. It shares the parking lot with a Holiday Inn and a Dennys. I\u2019m not a fan of Dennys so I wished it was something else, but that really has nothing to do with the hotel.

We decided to go check out the hotel on Thanksgiving Day; the lobby was very clean, bright and inviting. The lady at the front desk was very helpful and allowed us to take a look at one of their King Suite rooms...and when they say suite they mean suite! :) It was what I call and outdoor entrance to the room; you walked into a big space where the sofa bed, TV, desk, wet bar with sink, refridge and microwave were. Then you walked down a short hallway; to the right was the bathroom sink and then another door to the actual bathroom. As you cont. walking into the next room it opens up into another large room with a King bed, another TV and closet space. The rooms could use some updating, but over all looked clean, and the best part was you could move around and not feel enclosed in. I must say we were kicking ourselves after seeing the room because where we stayed was nice, but the kind suite rooms were small and made you feel closed in. The other nice part was the inside outdoor courtyard with Palm Trees and water fountains...very inviting if you just wanted to sit or walk around. The pool & hot tub were nice too.

She then proceeded to put me in a room with a king bed, when I had requested a room with two double beds when I booked four months ago. Best part was, she neglected to inform me. My parents, cousin, and I went up to the room, walked in, and realized we were given the wrong room type. I went back downstairs, had to wait for her AGAIN, then informed her that I had booked a different room. THEN, she decides to tell me that none were available, but that she would make a note in the computer now and make the changes tomorrow. Shouldn't she have made the notation in the computer when I checked in? And shouldn't common sense and courtesy require her to inform me of the change in rooms and offer an apology for the inconvenience? I didn't get any of that. Instead, I was made to feel that I was inconveniencing her for making her do her job. The next day, I called to request a room change, and someone else was working the front desk.
