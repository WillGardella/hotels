{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Decent choice for overnight stay I stayed at this hotel overnight before an early morning flight. Hotel is located conveniently near the main train station (less than 10 minute walk with bags), with convenient transport to hotel (about 15 minutes by train).Check in was pleasant, with the person at the front desk being very nice. The room itself was quiet and tastefully decorated, but a bit on the small side, especially considering how much I was paying. I also paid for their business package which gives Wi-Fi and free movies, but the internet was s-l-o-w and my TV did not work properly. I chose this hotel because it was the cheapest, reasonable hotel that was accessible to the airport. While I would stay here again if it comes to that, next time I am in Frankfurt I will look for a different hotel.", "Date": "Dec 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR116454592", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "JKDC"}, {"Content": "Convenient to Hbf (main train station); fine for brief stay       Bed", "Date": "Nov 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR133401929", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "yong111en"}, {"Content": "Nice Boutique Hotel We stayed at the Flemings Hotel for 2 nights on vacation prior to traveling to other parts of Germany. Hotel is located near the main train station (Hopbanhof) in the city center. Although the hotel rooms were small, the hotel and room itself was charming, clean, simple and the perfect for our short stay. I think the room would have been problematic for us if we stayed there longer. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. They allowed us to stay in the room much later than the check out time. Bed was very comfortable. If there is one complaint I have of the hotel, it's location is less than desirable. I would suggest staying in the Sachsenhausen which caters to the locals and has better dining, siteseeing and shopping options.", "Date": "Oct 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR821897779", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Golod1"}, {"Content": "Very convenient This hotel was exactly what we needed for our last night in Europe. We had been there almost a month and stayed in some interesting places, so it was nice to have a clean, nice size room for our last night. We took the train from Paris to Frankfurt and just walked to Flemings. It was very easy to find. I liked the proximity to the Hauptbahnhof (main train station). We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant that night, which was practically empty. The food was good and the atmosphere was pleasant. We liked having the free wifi as well, that was very nice. The one thing that kind of put a damper on our stay is that when we were checking out they tried to charge us 100 euros even though I had booked our room online for 68. They worked to get it fixed but we had to leave to catch our flight to the States before they could get it all fixed. The good part was that I gave them my e-mail address and when I got home I had an e-mail waiting for me. Our Credit card had three pending charges on it totally over $300 but as far as we can tell, they only charged us 68 euros and the rest of the charges should fall off. My advice would be that if you book online before you go, make sure that you take the piece of paper that says how much you booked your room for because that might not be stated on your reservation in their system. Because I had this piece of paper, the process was a bit smoother.", "Date": "Aug 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR246855914", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "kgirlPhoenix_AZ"}, {"Content": "A very Good Choice My fourth visit, and it's still all good.

We've been at Fleming's for a week in New Year's Eve.

Cafes  pubs nearby and plenty of fast food in the railway station. It's a safe area although you can watch weird people at late night.Rooms : quite big (250 m2), large and comfortable double bed. Wide range of tv stations. Enough closet space for two. About the famous glass walled shower, it's really good and fun!. But only if you travel as a couple ,I guess.Staff : Room cleaning is very good and staff is polite and helpful.

This hotel is in a prime city location. We were able to walk around during the day and evening and felt safe. It is surrounded by office buildings and some other hotels. We had a room on the 3rd floor that faced the street. The noise was not too bad...until the police or an ambulance came by...then it was really bad. The room and lobby appear very modern. We chose to drive in Germany and drove from the airport. Parking is sparce. The hotel has about 10 spots and that's it. To enter for parking, you need to enter the driveway in front of a rollup door, ring a doorbell and find a space either at that level or via a car elevator in the basement which is very tight to maneuver in. The hotel has a gym in the basement with 3 or so machines which seems rather useless. They also have a decent sized sauna and a steam room that seats 2 very intimately. The hotel restaurant was pretty good. We ate breakfast there which included eggs to order and other european pastries and deli meats. We ate dinner there once too. It also was prepared well, good service and priced decent for what we got. Overall I would stay here again if I had business in Frankfurt. However, as a tourist, I would look a little harder next time. The front desk staff were courteous and did what they could to understand english. One word of note...don't get driving directions from them. Ask for a map and do it yourself. The hotel is close to the train station and that was convienent too. The room was fairly modern with a glass bathroom, low bed, small desk and decent television. Housekeeping did a good job. The A/C wasn't as powerful or as cold as what I'm used to while traveling in the US but it kept it comfortable. We had a regular room that was $161.00 euro per night.

Positive details:-sleek and chic decor. Modern clean dark woods with sleek lighting and clean linens. Glass shower and vanity/sink area were a stylish and innovative way to make use of a small area and make it appear more spacious.-free wireless internet. slow connection but most hotels I've stayed at charge $10+ per day to use. -large double bed was a single mattress instead of the usual two smaller mattressed pushed together that seem so common in european hotels. The mattress was adequate, but I prefer a more dense bed.-it was raining during our stay and the hotels offered free daily use of an umbrella. small detail that was very thoughtful and useful.-location is close to the Hauptbahnhof, but area felt secure. Our room faced an inside street so noise wasn't an issue and we slept with the window open. -In house bistro was delicious but expensive ($90 without drinks for fairly routine fare). Seems they have an accompanying deli that has a great selection of raw milk cheeses and cured meats and salads for togo orders.Needs improvement:-some minor and not so minor details with the bathroom area. Minor issue with the toilet room door not locking, door shuts okay but the lock doesn't function. Bigger issue, the shower doesnt seem to drain fast enough and water leaked out all over the bathroom area floor. We had to use all the available towels to soak up the leaking water and also had to wait a few minutes after showering to open door due to not wanting to unleash a flood of water. -In the toilet room there was what appeared to be a tiny smear of dried blood on the wall near the paper dispenser. Normally this would disgust me to the point I'd switch rooms, but for some reason it didn't affect me any more than I felt that housekeeping should pay attention more to details. It was a really small, but obvious stain.-like all hotels it seems, the glasses provided in the room did not appear clean. Mostly dusty or spotty, but one had dried brown fluid.Overall the hotel was comfortable and fun, I'd stay there again despite the few notable drawbacks, but only because the problems seem easily fixed and also fairly common in the hotel industry so they annoy me, but are tolerable.", "Date": "Jan 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR549436819", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "frankfurtermadchen"}, {"Content": "chic and sexy Hotel was well placed to see all the sights of Frankfurt.Unlike some hotel pictures , flemings lived up to all expectations.We loved the shower in the room all that was missing was a mirror on the wall at the foot of the bed!!!!!!!!The staff were very helpful and attentive.
