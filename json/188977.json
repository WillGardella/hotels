We had a nice welcome on arrival at Hotel Lenox and the lobby area was good space. We had booked for three nights and this was confirmed on our arrival so as it was our first trip to Paris we asked how much it would cost to upgrade to the junior suite for the duration of our stay. We were quoted 130 euro which was basically the difference between the two anyway. We decided that we would do it and make the stay extra special. The junior suite was over two floors but was very tiny. The bathroom had an unpleasant smell of a urinal that seemed to come from the shower drain not really condusive to getting ready to go out. The bedroom in the suite was up the stairs and perfectly adequate albeit a bit tired looking. We had breakfast included in our deal and would not have bothered if it had not been included. The chap that served the breakfast was very friendly so we could not fault the service but cold croissants are not the same as nice warm ones. So three days later, taxi ordered and all packed we went down to reception to check out. We waited for ten minutes for the receptionist to grace us with his presence. The taxi had arrived and the cases were loaded and the meter was now running. This was when they tried to charge us for the breakfasts but we had the email confirmation from Eurostar with us and were able to prove that it was included. Then they hit us with a bill for 390 euro for the room upgrade! This was beyond belief as the difference between the room rate for the deluxe room that we had already paid for and a junior suite was 50 euro a night on the maximum rate. The receptionist told us the 130 euro was per night and not as we had agreed for the duration of our stay. No one in their right mind would have agreed to pay 90 euro a night over the room rate. The exchange became really heated with the receptionist and it was very upsetting. We stuck to our guns and paid the agreed 130 euro but my husband was called every profanity going as we left. The taxi meter had already reached 17.50 euro before we even left the hotel! This experience really ruined the Paris experience for us and we will never return to the Hotel Lenox. The best advise I can give you is if you want to stay at this hotel and upgrade get the agreed amount printed out and signed for your protection.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cMy favourite hotel in Paris\u201d", "Author": "Christine M", "ReviewID": "UR124055415", "Content": "I've stayed at this hotel many times now, and this latest time the service, as ever, was wonderful.

First of all the breakfast room is charming and beautifully detailed with marquetry panelling of jazz musicians and themes from the '20s. I requested a soft boiled egg on the first morning and was asked in great detail exactly the degree of 'soft boiled' I desired - it was determined that it would be a four minute egg. It was perfection. The concierge recommended a favorite local restaurant of his to me which was excellent. On my last morning I had an early flight and had to leave the Hotel at 6:00AM before the restaurant was open. When I arrived in the lobby, Antonin, the concierge who had been on night duty had a tray prepared for me with steaming coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice and a Madeleine.

I was suprised to find no in-room coffee or tea facilities upon arrival, something I would expect from even fairly cheap hotels. When I asked on the second day if we could order a hot drink in our room, or take one up from the bar, I was informed that all drinks had to be taken downstairs. The second matter occurred during check out. I had paid in advance for the room and yet was asked to pay a further amount upon check out. I pointed out that I had paid in advance to secure the price of the room to be told that the rates had changed since I booked. I was insistent about the terms of my booking and so the staff member on duty checked the records to discover that, as our stay had been over a weekend, two of the nights were cheaper than shown on the computer.

Upon an exicted arrival into Paris via the Eurostar, only to receive a lack luster welcome by hotel staff which did not inform us of any ammenities (ie, no mention of the hotel password for internet, or breakfast times in the morning.) And I cannot believe no one on here has mentioned the room keys! OMG, they are 1980's first generation electronic key with the holes in the card that you have to leave with the front desk everytime you exit the hotel! The key should have been my tip-off of what was to come. Room was dull, dull, dull. No pictures on the wall just a bed, two black laquered nightstands, teeny tiny desk & chair, and a bathroom with ZERO counter space. And this was a DELUXE room, not a standard. Also NO ALARM CLOCK!! Just a old phone from the 80's that had no indication of what number to dial the front desk with. Yes, European hotels are smaller and I understand that, but this was mega small. My walk in closet at home was the size of this room. After spending all day/night out and about, came back to our room (don't forget we had to stop at the front desk to ask for our key) to relax a little before bed. TV only had French stations working. Told we should have 4 English stations, but they don't know why we don't have them. No apology, just a shrug of the shoulders. We gave up on that and decided to just go to bed. Whew, it is getting warm in our cubby hole we need to turn on the air-conditioning....uh NOPE! Broken in our room. And everyone on tripadvisor mentions how this is on a quiet street. It's quiet if the windows are CLOSED. But if it is open to get air circulating then the street is loud with motorcyles zooming past, ladies heels clip clopping on the street, and people talking loudy as they walk by. And don't forget the wonderful cigarette smoke that lingers up. UGH! Morning time, can't wait to get out of this room. Let's start this day with a clean slate figuratively and literally -- but oh no the shower! No water pressure to the shower head, just a little trickle. Now I can't wash my hair. That is it, I'm fuming. Finish getting ready with dirty hair and calm myself down enough to be civil to the front desk. Inform them of all the problems (no a/c, no tv, no water pressure) and tell them I either need a new room or some type of reimbursement. These are the two things I do give credit to the Lenox St. Germain for: 1. They could not give us another room so they compensated us 50 Euros per night. I still think 160 Euros per night for that hotel is too much. It really is a 2 star hotel in my eye. 2. The bed was comfortable. Although we did not use the blanket, I highly doubt it would be handy since it was thin and had a rough texture. It would not be a cozy blanket by any means. All in all I would definitely say check out some other places before you book here. To put it in the most forward way, we hated every minute of this hotel. Did not like it at all!!

Overall I would reccommend this hotel if you are not too fussed about the little details. Had they done things better I think they could have 4 stars but at the moment i would rate this hotel to have JUST at the lower end of 3 stars.(its not a negative comment, just realistic) My room was on the first floor (no16) and for a single traveler the size was fine (if we were 2 people i think it would be too small) I wouldve liked to be upgraded, I actually mentioned that perhaps i will see the other rooms but the concierge said that I have a very nice room (mmmm... ok lets see about that- alas i took his word for it, and now i'm wondering if perhaps I shouldve paid more and upgraded only because it wasn't as special as in the reviews, or on the pictures) I'm going to warn you that i'm quite a fussy person and i've stayed in numerous hotels and paying 130Euro per night for the classic room I would expect just a bit more. 1.) i understand the hotel has recently been renovated, well, I can tell that my room had new curtains, and a head board etc, but the doors and half of room being painted in chocolate brown definately didn't do it justice, plus it had an awful light brown throw over the bed (30C Paris) very artificial woollen thing i had to get rid of immediately 2) the bathroom wasn't renovated apart from a few new fixtures such as mirror but the tiles shouldve been changed as grouting was dirty, and they kept the old loo seat etc... just a bit dissapointing to be honest. The showerhead was attached to a cord that is too small so 50% of the water gushed through the top of that instead of through the showerhead. (There is a bath, but honestly i'm not sure that any adult would be able to fit in it as it is so small - these are all things that should be addressed during a renovation and they couldve then decided to install a shower instead!) 3) they had nice bedsheets and towels however i was under the impression that I will have a queen bed,what i got were two single beds pushed together, which left me unable to lie in the middle of the bed :-( (which is the pleasure of being a solo traveller paying for a queen bed and being able to stretch out, still the bed was comfortable and after a long day perfect!) 4)I was unable to open half of the cupboard as it was blocked by one of the bedside tables (i understand that there is nowhere else to put this cupboard, and it was a good size so not going to complain too much about this, however then placing the safe on the wrong side so that i'm now also unable to reach the safe or open the safe door fully due to it being placed on the wrong side of the cupboard (just attention to detail that is lacking) 5) there is no full length mirror...;-( as a lady i can't see how my outfit looks 6) the brown stripe carpets make it difficult to see if it might be dirty, and they were not particularly soft so decorwise it made the room very dark, and not the most welcoming. 7) I walked past other 3 star hotels and the curb appeal was much nicer, fyi, i'm not sure Hotel Lenox realised that their trees out front are half dead... perhaps they need to inspect, compared to other 3 stars who had beautifully manicured trees and lighting outside. PLUS POINTS!!!! 1)free wireless 2)lounge at entrance is lovely, nice music and magazines and beautifully decorated 3)the bar was closed and it wouldve been nice if i was told about this prior to my booking as it supposedly has live music, and it does look lovely on the inside, just the place you want to relax after a night out and walking in at 2 am for a nightcap. 4)Location location location, its a 3 minute walk to the seine, 8 minutes to the middle of the louvre, 2 minutes to the nearest Laduree, and surrounded by galleries and restaurants etc (howerver be warned that everything is closed during August (parisan holidays) and everything shut on Sundays.. ;-( 5)staff speak english and were helpful as i left my international plug at home... very good service (but perhaps couldve been a bit more by for instance asking if i'd like a coffee or a drink when i walked in late one night and sat in the lounge checking my emails... (just again coming from someone who is perhaps used to it?) 6)they were happy to keep my bags whilst i scoured the city after my checkout Conclusion: Should you stay here? YES, Would i stay here again...

They are just completing some renovation, but nothing that took away from the hotel. We booked a deluxe room to have some more space (keep in mind European hotels are smaller because they are in older buildings). Worth the extra Euro, and it was still a great value compared to other hotels in the area. This is in the heart of the Saint Germaine-Peres area, which has great shopping, great restaurants, and is central to all of the main sights; close to the boat to get to other points. Louvre is just across the river, Notre Dame a short walk, etc. The staff was VERY friendly, breakfast each morning was very good, and again the staff made sure there was plenty right up until 11am when they stop serving. The walls are a little thin, so at night we could hear doors close, etc but nothing horrible.
