A huge step down I think we can all agree. Cosmo gives you a trip to the best buffet in Vegas for breakfast, Hyatt gives you cold cereal fruit and not very good coffee. Cosmo has wifi that works, Hyatt does not. Very slow if at all. The staff was fine, but management needs to get in the habit of walking the property and finding and fixing problems. Outside I saw a drip sprinkler do an excellent job of watering the parking lot. Lots of those little things to be corrected. In the bathtub, the spigot could not make up its mind to be show or tub fill and noisily let me know! And the design makes the room seem cramped. Windows were dirty also. I remember back in the 80's when the Hyatt name represented the best of hotel in this country. Sadly, that no longer seems the case. As far as other reviews, somebody mentioned requesting a strip view, that's not possible for a place being between Swenson and Paradise. You can see the tops of strip hotels I suppose, but I would not call that a strip view. Also, no taxis? Just about every cab going to or from the airport uses Paradise and Swenson. If you can't get an empty one to find you here, well, I have no response. Did you ask the front desk for help? In a worst case, just walk over to Hard Rock, they always have cabs, and the liquor store across the street ALWAYS has limo drivers around because it gives away free coffee, and they will take you anywhere, believe me. In sum, if it's a business trip, it's ok. If you are coming for the \"vegas experience\" no way. VERY convenient for the ride back to the airport however, about as close as you can get and I did enjoy watching the planes land from my room!

I really think Hyatt has the very best product in the mid-scale space when it comes to Hyatt Place. I've stayed in quite a number of Hyatt Place properties now (and I darn well ought to have the Platinum status now - I think I've finally attained it). Many of the Hyatt Place properties are thoroughly / extensively renovated AmeriSuites and they have been done very well. I think the new build Hyatt Place properties are even better but I would still choose any Hyatt Place over a comparable choice. At the end of the day, the mid-scale hotel space is very crowded with all the comparable Marriott (Fairfield, Courtyard, TownePlace, SpringHill, etc.), Hilton Family (Hampton, HGI, Doubletree, Homewood, etc.), InterContinental Hotels Group (Holiday Inn Express) and more options. I've always thought of Hyatt as being a solid choice in upscale and high-end space but I was a bit skeptical about how far they'd be able to go with Hyatt Place. Hyatt and Marriott have the most lucrative promotions when it comes to their loyalty programs and this really drives my desire to stick with them whenever possible.

So I had to wait in the Vegas HEAT (95\u00b0+ deg.) for 20 min. I will say that the Driver was very nice and respectful and on the way to the hotel I calmed myself. No on to the Room#532 the Hotel is located off the strip which is good and bad depending on what you are there for. I was there for business so it was great for my needs, plus having the HARD ROCK CAF\u00c9 across the street is there if you wish to mix in a little business with pleasure.

My room at the Hyatt Place had Carpet Stains (see pic) by the coffee bar, room was also missing some of the toiletries (Tooth Paste), but overall I like the lay out of the room had a nice big 42\u201d flat screen to view, also a fridge to store you choice of beverages and there are restaurants all within walking distance. So although the front desk service could\u2019ve been better for having the HYATT name I was only pleased with staying there mainly because of the location of the Hotel. The So-called breakfast is a JOKE\u2026 Donuts and bagels is not a breakfast and I\u2019ve seen LA Quinta serve better food and that is not saying much, HYATT could provide better amenities for the rate there asking. The Shuttle Bus runs 5a -12a -ish to the airport I STRONGLEY recommend that you get conformation on Shuttle hours prior to leaving anywhere to avoid being stranded and would ask the Shuttle driver versus asking the front desk because the couldn\u2019t really give me a solid answer, this is why I put 5a \u2013 12a ish because on the night I stayed there the drive told me that he will continue to operate until about 130a.

Deanna at the front desk (bless her heart she was there when we checked in at 8 pm and also when we checked out the following morning). She was a doll. Very helpful with show suggestions, directions, etc. The hotel manager I presume was also very helpful and actually assisted in clearing tables in the breakfast area. Certainly not his job, but he didn't seem to mind one bit. That is very uncommon in other parts of the country. There was a hot breakfast included in our rate (omelet was excellent) and we also ordered a waffle which was a bit crunchier than we liked, but no biggie. The cook really tried.

It's a remodel of an older hotel, but has a more modern look. What I like best is the layout of the single room. Instead of having the bed, TV, chairs & desk all in 1 room, the 1 rectangular room is divided. There is the \"living room\" side with a large, comfy sofa & large ottoman-coffee table, desk & bar w/ fridge (which is a real fridge, not just a \"cooler\"). Then there is the sleeping area with the bed, vanity & bathroom. The large flat screen TV divides the room, and you can swivel it, so people can watch on the living room side without lighting up the whole sleeping area. You can also sit & work at the desk area without disturbing the sleeper. (Free wireless Internet, yay!) Rooms have always been clean. Beds & pillows are super-comfy! Staff is very friendly & helpful.

There is also a snack counter in lobby where you can also order beverages, snacks, sandwiches, salads 24/7. The negatives: Bathroom & closet are tiny. Some of the bathroom fixtures (shower nozzle & handles) seem a little unsteady or not installed well. Next door to Hyatt Place is a German beer hall, Hofbrau Haus.

Like almost all things in L.V., this is a much larger Hyatt Place than normal and it was pretty full from sports groups booked there (I think the S.D. State women's basketball team was one of the groups there). Seeing that, I was a bit nervous about room noise and the long lines for the complimentary breakfast but after requesting a quiet room, was surprised that it was a nice quiet corner room on the second floor. No noises from the other rooms around or above and the room was clean, well kept and comfortable (if you don't like firm beds then beware). As stated in some of the other posts, the only noise was from the airplanes overhead----having previously lived under a flight path, I think I was somewhat insulated from the noise but it is an issue to consider until they change the flight path. The wait for the breakfast line was not too bad and while they had run out of a couple of things when I first got there, I was surprised at how quickly it was replenished (compared to some of the other Hyatt Places I've stayed at). Did not take advantage of the pool (which was outdoors and looked nice) or the exercise room (which was on the second floor). They have 2 internet stations by the breakfast area in addition to the free wi-fi throughout the hotel. Did not take advantage of the free airport shuttle as I had driven over (but this is a great feature for L.V.) nor the complimentary shuttle to Planet Hollywood as I was told you had to call for pickup. However, location across from the Hard Rock Hotel/Cafe is great and if you're a walker, a great selection of restaurants on their \"Restaurant Row\" on Flamingo Rd. is about 10 min walk away.

Our room, like the other reviews suggest, was the size of a suite. Reasonably clean but quite an unpleasant smell lingering in the corridors. We were absolutely gobsmacked to find that we were under the flight path - perhaps flight path are the wrong words. Flight path suggests the planes have actually taken off before they bounce over the roof of the hotel. We are on the top ( 6th ) floor. The planes are constant - the sound of one, not disappearing before the next. The room vibrates as they go over and car alarms in the parking lot below sing in unison as the jets set them off. We asked if we could be moved to a lower floor thinking that maybe a few storeys above us would kill the noise ,but the room we were shown stunk of cigarettes ( although this is a non-smoking hotel ) and there was no getting away from the planes. The local pharmacy sells ear plugs. What we couldn't understand is why no-one else had mentioned this in their reviews. Well the answer is that for the next 6 months they are relaying a section of runway at the airport and during this time planes are taking off and landing on a different approach.

These fees are pretty standard at most, if not all the Vegas casino resorts. After a few days, they can really add up. The estimate given to me from their site was exactly the rate I paid to the penny! Also, Hyatt Place opened in December 2007 so it isn't beat up like most of the other places I've stayed in Vegas. I doubt you can find a more comfortable bed in town! Despite not having a restaurant, the amenities at Hyatt Place surpass most of the resorts too. The standard rooms are very large. The 42\" HDTV actually gets a ton of HDTV stations and pay per view movies. I'm amazed how many other hotels invest in HDTVs and then don't subscribe to get the HD stations. Of course, in Vegas, most resorts have poor TVs so you spend more time in the casino. The free wireless Internet was fast and flawless. You can connect your ipod to the TV speakers. Just remember to bring a cord. While some people here didn't like the location, I did. The strip mall across the street with the CVS has at least a half dozen good restaurants including a great New York Pizza place.
