There was a large floor standing airconditioner in the room, taking up a lot of space, but its noise prevented its use. The room and bathroom echoed to the noise of occupants in adjoining rooms using their bathroom facilities. The paint/plastic on the windows was peeling and the sealant around the windows, bath and sink was unkempt and grubby. There was mould and goo in the sink overflow and the general hygiene and cleanliness of the facilities was worse than many 1 and 2 star hotels we have stayed in. The hotel brochure noted that complimentary coffee would be provided if we contacted reception, so we ordered coffee for two and when it arrived were asked to pay \u00a315.

I stayed for a weekend in March. As I said in my title, the hotel is not terrible - but it could *easily* be so much better. This hotel is supposedly rated 5-star, but in my mind to earn a rating like that requires much more attention to detail than found at this property. To begin - there are two entrances to this hotel. One off of Piccadilly and one off the street behind the hotel. The 'back' street entrance is the actual entrance, even though the hotel fronts onto Piccadilly. What is strange is that there are no staff posted to the entrance on Piccadilly - so if you want assistance with your bags (if you took the tube like I did) you have to walk through the hotel to the reception desk at the rear. Furthermore - you need to walk with your bags through the elegant Palm Court! I would have hated to pay for an expensive afternoon tea in the Palm Court to watch people walk through pulling their luggage all afternoon! The room itself was nothing special. The bed was comfortable, and quite clean - but really, for this price - is it worth mentioning? (only when everything else is so disappointing). I my room, the hairdryer was pathetic, and totally inadequate, and possibly 20 years old. Again, not up to standard. While our room did in fact have a tub - it was inoperable as the tub stopper would not seal, and the faucet only allowed water to flow through the handle - not the faucet itself. Again - poor upkeep. Surely if someone is paying for a room like this - everything should be in working order. Again, the little things matter. The music playing at the reception was totally inappropriate. As a 90's child - I appreciate alternative rock as my taste, but nirvana playing on check in? I saw more than a few raised eyebrows... Overall - this hotel could be so much more - it is just disappointing. If you are planning a visit to London, I would not seek this hotel out - but if you are booked to stay here, it will be satisfactory (just) but nothing at all special - which is a shame as it could very easily be.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely not a 5* hotel!\u201d", "Author": "rumbers", "ReviewID": "UR126337057", "Content": "I booked a double room through the Lastminute.com 'secret hotel' deal recently, and paid approximately \u00a3110 (room only). The location of the hotel is great for anyone staying in London - right between Hyde Park Corner and Piccadilly Circus, opposite Green Park. Very close to the tube, and a short walk from the buzz of the West End. However, I have to say that the experience wasn't really worth \u00a3110 (thank goodness I didn't pay the full \u00a3200+ price or I'd have been furious). Firstly, reception didn't have a record of my booking - apparently the Last Minute.com booking reference didn't match theirs. After a 10 minute wait, they eventually went through the manual records and found it on the system. The room itself was fairly small, which was no problem, but definitely didn't live up to a 5* experience as billed. So, the good points. Decent flat screen TV, safe, comfortable bed, wi-fi (though at a cost, and only 1 bar of reception). The bad points. The bathroom was VERY outdated and in need of refurbishment. Old cracked marble tiles, old taps, an annoying 'clingy' shower curtain round the bath...it just looked and felt old and tired. The shower pressure was fine, but overall, not great. No kettle or tea and coffee making facilities, let alone a complimentary bottle of water. The minibar was secured with a tag, so I didn't even bother looking in it - I suspect it would have been prohibitively expensive. Poor climate control - the room was far too hot, and the old dials seemed to do nothing useful. So, all in all, great location, old and tired rooms. I think there are probably better, refurbished 'executive' rooms, which were offered to me for an additional \u00a348, but as we were only there one night for a stop-over while seeing a show, it didn't seem worth it.

Initial reaction was good. Although the Hotel is old it's charm still seeps through the tiredness of some of the hotel fabric. We decided to book an executive double as some of the Trip Advisor Reviews suggested that the standard double rooms were somewhat disappointing in many respects. Our room (601) was spacious, clean and quite acceptable considering the age of the Hotel. The room which was supposed to be a double was in fact a twin. Not really a problem but the receptionist offered to have \"Housekeeping\" convert the beds to a double whilst we were out at the Theatre. We decided to eat our evening meal in the Hotel Restaurant and were advised by Reception to book a table via the Consierge as, being a Saturday, availability of a table for dinner could not be guaranteed unless booked in advance. On returning from the Theatre during early evening we went up to our room to change for dinner only to find that the beds had not been converted to a double as promised. Not that much of a problem really so we let it pass. At about 8pm we went down to the restaurant for dinner only to find that the Consierge had apparently failed to book a table for us for dinner. The Restaurant Manager's attitude was somewhat disappointing as he considered that it was not his problem and went off to see if he could find a vacant table. He duly returned with the announcement that he had solved \"our problem\" and escorted us to a table. My wife and I chose our meals and the Restaurant Manager recommended that my wife's order should be accompanied by a side dish of vegetables. Our meals duly arrived and we reminded the waiter that he had forgotten to bring the vegetable side dish. Thinking that the vegetables would arrive propmptly, we started to eat our meals. Some time later, after we had virtually finished our main courses, a waitress appeared with the vegetable side dish. We explained that it was too late for the vegetables and instructed her to remove the item from our bill. The waitress insisted that we accept the vegetables without charge and it was becoming embarrassing that she would not take the side dish away. We asked to see the Restaurant Manager who aplogised for the error and told us that he would discuss the matter with the chef. I explained to him that we had specifically chosen to stay at the Sheraton Park Hotel and also to eat in the Restaurant as it was a special occasion and so far we were less than impressed with the experience at the Hotel and its restaurant. After our meal I asked to see the Duty Manager and was met by Roman Husock who attempted to excuse all of the events experienced so far. It was at that point in time that Mr Husock told me that the Sheraton Park Lane Hotel is a Five Star Hotel. I explained to him that if the Hotel is in fact Five Star, the management should inform the Hotel Staff of what is expected at such a level. A degree of intensive training perhaps or just a reduction in the Hotel's Star Rating may be the best solution.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location ..

Then our first morning we discovered that there wasn't any hot water---a massive inconvenience to our plans---and then when we attempted to check into our second room after the first night for a guest that had joined us, the very inexperienced receptionist, Kia, was incredibly rude and declared that our reservation had been cancelled to the whole reception area, and couldn't seem to grasp that we had TWO reservations for separate rooms and insinuated that the four of us were attempting to stay in the same room!

After I found out it was The Park Lane I went to check out the reviews on Trip Advisor, and boy was I shocked and more than a little disappointed as to what Priceline was getting me into. As a result of the poor reviews I decided I would take Mr. Paul Dumphy (the hotels GM) up on his offer to contact him and asked if it would be possible if I could request a refurbished room. Mr Dumphy quickly responded and passed my request on to a duty manager who also sent me an EM stating that they were aware of the challenges the hotel was facing due to it's age, but that they were in discussions with Sheraton regarding financing for a major overhaul of the entire hotel - which we all can agree it needs. When I checked-in I was very happy to find I had been upgraded to a 6th floor park view executive room, which was very spacious and comfortable, even if a little old school. I must say that all my contact with the hotel staff during my 4 day stay was first rate - they are what allow this hotel to claim a 5 star rating - first rate. Also during my stay there were a couple of issues which seemed to get resolved very quickly. The first was the funky smell in the grand Palm Court. I noticed it on my first day, as I was going down to the gym (unfortunately you have to go through the elegant Palm Court in your work-out clothes in order to get to the gym in the basement - however the gym is nice, and reasonably well equipped). By the time I checked out the issue had been fixed. The second issue was the East wing elevator - on my third morning as I was leaving for the day, I got into the elevator, the doors closed but the car didn't move. I kept my finger on the lobby floor button and eventually the car moved down. Unfortunately when I got to the lobby floor the doors wouldn't automatically open, so I pressed the \"door open\" button and the doors opened. I immediately reported the problem to the bell hop. Later that afternoon I returned to the hotel, and sure enough the elevator was posted with an \"out of service sign\". By early evening when I returned again to the hotel the elevator was back in service.

It's supposed to be in art deco style, not that you get that from the room. The bathroom was tiled - so I suppose that was in line with the art deco style...and maybe it's just me, but I don't like white, square-tiled bathrooms. The bathtub was generous, but since I didn't take a bath and only showers, I can tell you without a doubt the following: the fittings for the shower head and taps were on the side wall and given the curtain behind you, there's very little space to shower in comfort...very narrow. In terms of sleep quality, bed etc was comfortable but the a/c in the room blew lukewarm air. So I spent a few mins in a warm room before I opened the window to let in the cooler air. Anyway, the bar/tea room downstairs was truly art deco, with big band music sometimes playing, interspersed with music from Cafe Del Mar. (The strange thing is if you enter from Park Lane, you have to walk through this bar/tea room to get to the lobby). I used the gym (open 24hrs and accessible by key card) and it was ok. Also ate at Citrus, their in-house italian restaurant, which was pretty good. I had a starter portion of the bass fish which was big enough for me not to have a main. The spaghetti was done al dente and quite authentic. Even in the upgraded room, the internet was GBP6 pr hour or GBP17 for 24hrs. So I had to pay, but at least it was fast and it did not drop at all. Finally, it's about a 15-20min walk to Piccadilly and a few mins more to Leicester Square...and to get to the hotel from \"Heafrow\", take the Piccadilly line and get off at Green Park (not Hyde Park Corner) which is a little closer to the hotel.

There is a lot to do in the area, and the property is right by several parks (which were terrific for running). Furthermore, the property looks great - from the outside. It also has a bar/tea area that is one of the areas you would walk through when entering the hotel. This area is definitely the nicest area of the hotel. The bad: The hotel needs to be unpdated becuase it did not feel clean, and parts of my room felt run down. While I will admit that I prefer modern over traditional design, I don't mind traditional when it is well maintained. This hotel isn't. Futhermore, the lobby itself is very understated. I will also admit that I was concerned about the cleanliness of the room and sheets, because there were some stains on the sheets (not large, but still a little disconcerting for me). The lobby staff was not friendly but not rude either. I'd describe their attentiveness as average to below average. However, the concierge was helpful. I probably would have given this hotel a three star rating just because I liked the location as well as the look of the exterior. However, the booking site I used classified this as a 5 star property, but it has the look and upkeep of a 3 or even a 2.5 star property. I would recommend looking elsewhere. If I had booked this hotel in the U.S., I wouldn't have cared as much because I travel within the U.S. all the time. The only concern I would have had was about whether the room was sanitary. Because I am not in London often, I considered just loosing my money and going to a different hotel. I ended up staying, but I noticed a hotel that had comparable rates for the time I was staying, and I wish I had stayed there.

You could tell the hotel was making upgrades as the walls were being painted in the hallway while we were there, and the carpet in the room smelled and looked brand new. The furniture in the room was nice, but was a bit scuffed up. So the rooms could have used either new furniture, or some re-finishing. The bathrooms were nice, ours contained a tub and a stand-up shower. They did look like they were last renovated in the 90s though, so they could use some updating; although, everything was clean and in working order. If I had more time I would have loved to have high tea in their Palm Court, the tea looked very nice and the room is beautiful. There was a harpist playing there when we went. The food also looked good. I don't think the tea was cheap though. I want to say it was something like 36 pounds a person or close to $60 USD. You had to pay extra for wi-fi and the price was exorbitant; however, depending on which room you stay in, you could pick up the free wi-fi from the other hotel next door...

Overall the staff were helpful and the common areas were luxurious as you would expect from a 5 star hotel. We had requested a twin room and that was no problem for them. Check in and out was easy. All good so far. My issue with this as a 5 star hotel is that the bedrooms are old and tired with bland decore. Definately needed a paint job. There was some sort of air conditioning machine in the room which wouldn't have been out of place in a 1950s American motel. The bathroom was definately substandard as well with a mixer shower tap over an old bath. It was quite a art to shower without a scolding or being frozen!

I have stayed a number of times since I last reviewed it in 2006, most recently this weekend, and while I can see justification for some of the criticism, there is still much to be admired about the Park Lane. The first thing that I will admit is that I am amazed that it is still open as a Sheraton, as it was thought a major refit was only just around the corner. That has obviously not yet happened, and during my stay the hotel was very busy, my first reaction therefore would be that poor hotels are not usually fully booked. The best points are the food, the 'Palm Court', the beds, (try to get a refreshed room) and the friendly staff. The hotel restaurant, 'Citrus', is a quality restaurant, the food is excellent and well presented, again full during my visit: breakfasts are taken in Bracewells and are as much as you want to set yourself up for the day...eggs benedict is highly rated by my wife!! Palm Court is a wonderful place to sit and watch life go by, the afternoon tea service is rated as one of the best in London. The bedrooms are variable, the refreshed ones are fine espcially on the SPG floor, the beds are excellent and the wide screen TV's have a wide range of channels. It still irks me in this day and age having to pay \u00a316 a day to use 'wifi' in the bedroom...but then the Park Lane is not alone in this policy. Some of the rooms are 'tired' and you will have to see what you can do if you really object to one of these rooms. Overall the hotel still has a sense of the grand about it, but I would hazard that a major job must be done on it in the not too distant future...but I bet that will be after the Jubilee and the Olympics have passed.

First up, the supposed dress code? There isn't one! We dressed quite smartly for the occasion but it seemed you could wear what you wanted. Saw one guy with a bright green puffer jacket, jeans, trainers and a bobble hat. Perhaps that is what they meant by \"smart/casual\" ? Staff, all of whom seemed to be from Eastern Europe, were very pleasant and efficient. Our coats were taken to the lobby for us and we were seated right next to the harpist who did a sterling job playing throughout the afternoon. We were asked if we wanted drinks but since Champagne was included in our menu we just ordered sparking water which arrived promptly. The waitress opened the bottle and poured the water for us. A slice of fresh lemon had been added to the glass which was nice and something we both like with our sparkling water. Following this we were brought two glasses of Taittinger Brut Prestige Rose Champagne, which I believe is a blend of different Champagnes? I'm not a connoisseur but it was very nice so no complaints there. After about ten minutes another waitress came and asked what tea we would prefer. My wife chose Jasmin and I went for the Moroccan Mint as I wanted to compare it with the tea we have at home. The tea's arrived in good time and our cups were filled by the waitress. So, first big let down, the tea. Not great. Although they clearly used full mint leaves for my tea it hardly tasted of anything at all. In comparison the Dragonfly Organic Moroccan Mint I have at home tastes far superior and that comes in a bag! My wife's Jasmin didn't fair any better....it looked nice but that was about all. Next up came the finger sandwiches. There were five in all. Coronation Smoked Chicken, Roast Beef with Wasabi, Roasted and Smoked Salmon on Pesto Bread, Grated Egg Creme Fraiche and Cress on Carrot & Herb bread and finally White and Brown crab meat with cucumber on brown bread. All sounds very nice? Very bland would be a better description. Honestly I have had tastier sandwiches in a Costa Coffee shop! There seemed to be little if any seasoning and you would have been hard pressed to notice the different types of bread if indeed they were different. Moving on, next to arrive were the scones. I think there were two fruit and two plain along with two types of clotted cream and two preserves. These at least were well made and the preserves and cream were very tasty indeed. Last up were what they call the \"Fine French Pastries\". I think the French would be appalled to have their country's name tacked on to these. They \"looked\" the part but were disappointingly tasteless. Someone else mentioned the traffic through the middle of the tea room and I have to agree. Having people wandering through with their cases and shopping on the way to their rooms just cheapens the whole affair and pretty much turns it into nothing more than a premium price cafe. We had no complaints about the staff. All were friendly, in an efficient sort of way and did their job superbly. The decor is nice and were it not for the constant stream of people walking through it would have probably left us with a much nicer impression. The big let down for us though was the food. It doesn't matter how nice your decor is or if you have a harpist playing beautiful music in the background, if the food doesn't taste good then the whole exercise is no more than smoke and mirrors. We are not expert food critics but we do know good food when we taste it and this definitely wasn't it! Honestly we could have spent a third of the price and gone to our local Marks & Spencers super store where they have an excellent restaurant. Ok the surroundings are definitely not as nice and the staff often leave a lot to be desired but the food is ten times better and it would have cost a lot less....oh and we could have done our shopping at the same time :) I think we'll try The Ritz next. It's costs more and is not so easy to get a booking but at least they DO have a dress code and I heard the food is much better.

I was upgraded to an Executive Room, so my room was big and comfortable but the regular rooms are a bit on the small size for this category of hotel. My biggest complaint remains that the hotel is noisy. Not street noise, and wisely the layout is such that you do not hear the neighboring TV (the bathroom buffers that, which is great). However, the doors are very heavy, and they slam shut. So when others come or go on your floor, or the floor above, you know usually know about it. It was impossible to get rest without earplugs. A new experience during this stay was the screeching of the pipes from an adjacent room early in the morning. I asked my husband if it was a fire alarm. Luckily this didn't happen every morning, but when it did it was terrible and lasted as long as our neighbor's shower. The bed is very comfortable. The location is terrific, right across from Green Park and just a block from the Green Park Tube and walking distance to many sites. I have always found the staff was very nice and polite. The concierge at night was very kind and friendly. Because fog delayed our flight and we'd arrived at 2 a.m. I had phoned ahead and we we arrived all our paperwork was ready to go (we appreciated the speed since we were so exhausted). The prices for all hotel dining are outrageous, and why bother anyway with so many excellent options in walking distance. London hotel prices overall are overpriced, so while I think this hotel would be overpriced in any other city it is really a reasonable value by comparison. It is one of very few hotels I've experienced in the UK (where I have traveled extensively over the past 20 years) that doesn't have a total disaster of a shower situation -- i.e. they have managed to design a bath/shower that doesn't completely flood or wet the bathroom floor. That alone is surely worth a few extra pounds and worth a return visit. The closet is enormous and has a good safe, which is great if you're staying a few days. Probably the worst thing about this hotel is having to use the odd side street entrance, where nasty drivers are ready to run you over and taxis are always speeding along. The hotel frowns upon using the Palm Court entrance on Piccadilly, so usually guests are forced to take an unpleasant walk down the side street (whose street sign is torn down, are where one night revelers had vomited along the tiny sidewalk).", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cEasy access to Heathrow\u201d", "Author": "Durak", "ReviewID": "UR121074526", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel two days.

I had an upgraded room as part of Plantinum status, but it was still so dated, and not in the quaint British style. The carpet was threadbare and the bed was the typical 2 beds pushed together. I came back one day and the nightstand was pulled far from the wall (like perhaps they were trying to clean, but then never put it back?). The room set up was odd too, the TV was off to the side wall, instead of being straight forward. Actually, when I walked in from the hallway, there was an internal hallway with a closet and a door to the bathroom and then a door to the bedroom. Weird layout, but it was okay. There was a lovely bathtub in the bathroom and overall it was a huge bathroom with a window, so that was nice, high ceilings too. There is a safe in the room, which I used, and when I tried to open it one night, it was completely dead. I left it alone as I didn't need anything immediately and tried it again the next day, but still didn't work. I called down to maintenance and they had someone up pretty quickly, actually 2 people together, which was good practice, as it was later at night and I was a female traveling alone. Luckily since I had that weird hallway and the safe was in the closet, I could go back in my room for privacy. They worked on it for about 20 minutes with no luck, then said they would come back, they did a little while later and finally got it open. I didn't mind that it took so long, I thought they handled it well, were really apologetic and ultimately got the job down.

I'm not a fan of the Le meridien there either as the rooms as quite rundown, so I've opted for the Sheraton as I am loyal to Starwood.

By the second time we stayed at the Park Lane, we knew to ask for a non-smoking floor. We were put up on the top floor. The bed was HEAVEN (again, especially compared to other European hotels we've used) and the bathroom was well done too. Our room was very quaint with lots of character.

It was impossible to produce a constant temperature, and I totally gave up trying after many minutes. The room furniture looked like it had been picked up at a charity shop.

When we got into the room it was bright and clean. Beds were very comfortable. There were complimentary tea and coffee facilities available (you had to contact reception to get it delivered). The Bathroom had retained its original victorian tiles which was nice, and the bath was half sized but since i shower anyway it didn't bother me. The only issue i had with the room was that the shower head could do with updating (it would only aim straight down and you couldn't adjust this due to the shower head being too heavy for the hinge). I understand they want to retain the victorian style but lets be honest, most people would be happy to forego the style for usefulness. This upgrading seems to have been adapted in other aspects of the room since we didn't get a 'yellow box' hairdryer, we just got a normal one so please consider new shower heads to match. We didn't have food here as \u00a326 for a breakfast seems a little overpriced so can't comment on that. Overall a very good stay and no problems encountered (apart from the shower). Would definatley stay here again, although perhaps wouldn't pay normal room fees, but if i was paying a similar price as this time, i would be happy to.

An easy walk to Piccadilly, Soho, the West End and (in the other direction) Hyde Park and even Knightsbridge; 2) Staff. I personally have never had a bad experience here and for the last two times I would say the staff --- especially at the front desk --- were excellent; 3) Convenience. Green Park Tube is nearby, and Shepard Market with it's varied eateries and pubs is almost literally \"just around the corner\". While rooms vary in size, we've never had one that was not acceptable or dirty. Depending on where your room is ordered on the schedule for cleaning and the occupancy of the hotel, it can be mid-afternoon before the room is serviced --- but that's true of any large hotel. Word of warning: Although the Park Lane fronts on Piccadilly, the hotel is actually in Mayfair. This is important if you're booking a car from Heathrow or one of the other airports (we find the cost to be significantly less than a taxi) because to a Piccadilly location the fare can be upwards of 130 pounds, whereas to Mayfair 55 pounds. The diffenence, in large part, is because starting about where the Park Lane is located on Piccadilly heading towards the Circus, traffic snarls down to a crawl at almost all times of the day.

From the moment we arrived in our \u201cupgraded\u201d suite to find a dirty, dark hodgepodge of small connected rooms, that obviously hadn\u2019t been renovated in the past 30 years, we were disappointed. This disappointment only deepened with each day of our stay. After sending an email to the guest contact that had arranged our extended stay stating we wanted to move to another SPG property, I was contacted by Roman, a front desk manager. He called at 10am stating we would be moved to a renovated room. After hastily packing up the entire room I then waited and waited and waited for him to call me back. After 5 hours I was finally shown a room. 7 hours after his initial phone call, we were moved into a new room. Roman assured me that this room would be allocated to us each week throughout our 5 week stay (we checked out on a few weekends to travel outside of London). He stated he wanted us to feel at home since we were staying so long and convinced me that the previous mistakes would be rectified so we chose to remain at the Park Lane. No follow up phone call or apology was ever sent to us. We checked out that weekend and arrived 2 nights later to be told our room wasn\u2019t actually available. We were given a new room that was considerably smaller, had a bathroom half the size of the previous and we went from a king bed to a glorified full. Another email sent and we heard nothing for 3 days. When they finally contacted us they asked if we wanted to move again. Needless to say I refused to let them inconvenience me further with yet another move after having unpacked everything because we had heard nothing from them. Again, no apology or note was sent. Nicholas, another manager, assured me that he had allocated the original promised room for the rest of our stay and when we checked out and back in we would receive it. No apology or note was sent. We sent an email to the general manager. He sent a tiny 2\u00a3 bottle of cheap wine with one apple as his apology. 2 weeks later we check out again and upon return are yet again told our room was reallocated. We are put in a room so small we could barely fit our luggage inside. My spouse and I travel full-time because of her job and live almost exclusively in hotels throughout the year with an average of 200+ days in Starwood Properties. I tell you this because I want the average guest to bear this in mind when reading this review. If this is the customer service long-term guests with Platinum status receive, you can draw your own conclusions as to the level of service you should expect to receive at the Park Lane. We have stayed in hotels throughout the world and have never experienced such disregard from hotel management, especially at a Starwood Property. As you can imagine this attitude has trickled down to most of the staff as well. Aside from the shockingly apathetic management, the hotel is in dire need of a renovation with stained carpets, peeling wallpaper, ragged furniture and outdated fixtures throughout. The only good things I experienced in my 5 week stay were the breakfast and the location. If those 2 items are at the top of our priority list for a hotel then go with the Park Lane.

Check-in was slightly delayed due to the room still being cleaned. This inconvenience worked out to my favor because as we were sitting in the lobby waiting for the room, the front desk realized I was a gold member.

Staff on Reception very helpful and seemd to speak various languages as there was a queue when we arrived and I could hear them talking with other guests - I was offered an upgrade from our Standard Room to an Executive Room for an additional 40 pounds per night. I had made our booking via LateRooms.com and took a chance on their 5* Mystery Hotel - I'm pleased I did as I feel we got a good deal and didn't need the upgrade as our Standard Room was large enough in size with very comfy beds so we didn't bother with the upgrade. Apart from the bed, the rest of the furniture does need updating though as does the bathroom which really isn't 4* standard, but as we weren't staying in the room much it didn't bother us. Strangely you have to request the tea/coffee making facilities and iron from Reception (I've never known this in any hotel I've stayed in?)Getting around London from the hotel is easy as you can buy a one day or one week Travel Ticket and use the tubes and buses all day. The hotel is easy walking to Piccadilly though and Leicester Square is just a minute walk further on so China Town, Soho, Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden all easy to get to on foot if you are reasonably fit. However if like us you feel you have walked miles all day long (we went to Portabello Road Market on the Saturday which is huge - so we bought a Travel Ticket as you have to get there by tube) and right outside of the hotel just to the right on Piccadilly is a bus stop which takes you right through the West End to ease those aching feet. The only problem we had in the hotel is that on the second night, the same-sex guests next door arrived back around 2.50 a.m. and woke me up with their laughing and talking and then you can guess what came next - for a couple of hours these women didn't bother about anyone else trying to sleep! so noise between rooms was a problem and then to top it all off at 5 am the TV set in our room came on of it's own accord - no idea why as it hadn't happened on our first night. Inconsiderate guests are not the fault of the hotel though and as they hadn't disturbed my husband who slept through the whole episode I didn't call Reception to ask them to assist in getting our noisy neighbours to shut up. I would stay at this hotel again - I have stayed in several in central London and this room size for a Standard is good, but not 5*. One tip I have for theatre tickets is to check out directly with the theatre in advance before you go to the so-called 50% off ticket shops and booths around and online. I wanted to see Les Miserables and checked all of the on-line ticket agencies and was surprised to find out that buying direct from the theatre was the cheapest as you get them face value.

So with a MacBook and an Ipad, we were up for 100 pounds, which seemed quite excessive. The room we were shown (115) was a shocker! Two single beds, each made up for one person were pushed together to make one bed. The furniture was extremely tired...a small lamp sat with the shade askew, and the shower was an old fashioned bath tub with a shower curtain. I don't know what the non-upgradre room would have been. I spoke with the Duty Manager, Daniel, who offered us room 126 instead. This had a king sized bed and a comfortable large modern bathroom, though with no shower cap, one bar of soap and one bottle of shampoo. A walk in closet offered plenty of space. The room also had a completely mismatched table and desk, one comfortable wing chair and a mismatching office chair on wheels at one table with no room for a seat at the desk, which had a very noticeable chip on the corner. It seemed as if a bunch of leftover, random furniture was pushed together into one room. To plug in a hairdryer or computer I had to crawl under one table to find a powerpoint. The room had no facilities for making tea and coffee, one bathrobe for two people, and an ironing board with no iron. All of these were promptly provided after a word with Nigel. I've stayed in many Sheraton 5 star properties in various parts of the world. None had rooms that looked anything like these two. After the second room my wife and I gave up and accepted 126.

It is astonishing how the standard of the rooms within the same category vary so outrageously. Sometimes we've had the type of room you would expect from a Hotel of this standard. Other times we have been given a room more akin to a 3rd rate B & B (trust me I am not exaggerating - you just need to look at reviewers photos) On my last stay We were given a room so awful, it felt as if we'd checked into a filthy squat. Unfortunately, and even though my Husband and I hated the room. We made the decision not to complain due to the fact that a Family member had paid for this as a treat and they were also staying at the Hotel with us. The Park lane has only one saving grace - The stunning Palm Court. This at least remains a great place to come for afternoon tea. The bar is also beautiful.

The only problem is that it is not a five star hotel, but is sold as one. If you were advised that it's a four star property (and charged accordingly) you'd be perfectly happy here. The problem is that there is a lot of money needing to be spent at the property. Carpets, both in the rooms and common areas, are older and in some cases in fairly poor condition. Fittings and fixtures in the rooms are a long way from being 5 star in quality and condition. Having said all that, the service here is, for the most part, 5 star. Superb room service staff and food.....and at realistic prices, which is not always the case these days. Very helpful lobby staff. If not for the condition of the rooms, you could just about call this a legitimate 5 star property. But the rooms are what they are, despite the excellent efforts of the manager of the property (who in all fairness has no control over whether the owners spend millions upgrading the rooms or not) to compensate for the slightly shaky room quality through great service. I've only seen the executive rooms, which are apparently much nicer than the standard rooms. If so, you do not want a standard room. The Exec rooms are only \"pretty good\"....and will set you back over \u00a3300 after VAT is applied. You can stay at the Ritz across the road for just another \u00a3150 or so, and the Ritz is in a different universe. So the bottom line is that if you can get a room at the Park Lane at 4 star prices...i.e., \u00a3125 a night or so......it's a good deal, and good value for money...and you'll be quite happy. Between Tripadvisor's \"Top Secret\" hotels, which often features the Park Lane, and Priceline, you should be able to get in at that sort of price. But if you're paying full whack.....you are most definitely NOT getting good value for your money. Paying 5 star prices for a 4 star hotel is no fun.

Followings : 1) We had reservation for two rooms 2 adults and 2 children. While booking on the phone I had to agree 2 rooms as 1 room can't allow 4 people despite one is really minor aged 3. No issue on that. On arrival the 2 rooms we were given not inter connected, however, 2nd room took 2 hours to get ready. Sill no issue. But both the rooms were tiny and some one can't even properly stretch. Rooms were not equipped with any basic amenities ie mini refrigerator, hair dryer etc. The rooms were not centrally air-conditioned and one of the room the standing cooling system was not working. So we had no choice but to upgrade ourselves to suit which can accommodate 4 people, (however, when I was booking online I have been told several time that no room even the suit can hold 4 people including minor as per the UK regulations) superior, larger, spacious at a cost of additional 200 GBP per night means 2 rooms price that we booked originally plus GBP 200 per night. However, no one could tell us properly what is the room called or named. 2) The suit we got finally was spacious, however none of the doors inside the suits were working. The room was old and not sure when last carpet was cleaned. They said it is a refurbished room. 3) When you travel with 3 years old child you don't expect to order hotel food, kids burger every time. So one evening we bought food from outside for kids and requested for extra plates and spoons and in reply room service informed us per extra plate will be charged GBP 3 and the funny thing is they are confused themselves. Looks like adhoc basis decision. No Sheraton where I stayed in most of the Asia ever asked for 3 GBP extra plate charges. How could you ask some one for extra plate charges who is paying GBP 450 plus per night (excluding vat) for 8 days staying. This is unprofessional and mis selling. Even the gentleman Who served the plates were very much disappointed with his boss's decision . 4) Internet GBP 6 per hour but You can avail package GBP 50 per week. Hotel business decision and I fully respect that but I will expect service. I got a package for 7 days and we need 3 handheld to be connected to the WIFI system. Unfortunately, we get connected to 1, while enquiring and reply from hotel was each additional device has to pay GBP 50 pound each. For what and why, you can get multiple wifi connection from same source and all of our homes connections are such. Is it a additional money making ways for Sheraton park lane? I think the entire place lacks management leadership and directions. I will not request any one to stay there. It is situated at best possible locations. From front you go to green park and got to see buckingham palace in 5 mins walk from back end you are linked to park lane And slight walk will take you to HYDE park. Property is doing injustice to it's competitive advantage. Sheraton global management should look into with immediate effects because similar kind of reviews I have just seen in trip advisor. Sheraton global management should take the full advantages of location by not charging per plate 3 GBP but by providing best quality service at cost of high room charges. Let's not be penny wise, pound foolish! Please try to make more money than 3 GBP for additional plates.

The room was always reserved, so book tea early. We had a \"classic\" room with a king size bed that was quite spacious with chair and ottoman. The rooms have traditional charming English style. Some tiles were cracked on the floor in bathroom, but this does not bother me, I think it adds to the English charm. The bathroom was very clean and so were the sheets/bed/floors.

We stayed at three Starwood properties using points from my SPG Gold account. I love the Starwood program and find tremendous value using this credit card and hotel program. It was a fantastic experience all around using the Park Lane, Edinburgh Resort and Spa and Heathrow Sheraton. Our first night was spent in London at the Sheraton Park Lane. After the long haul flight we were brought to our hotel by car service. The car dropped us off at the front door on Piccadilly which is not the door used for check-in. The revolving doors were tough with luggage and you then have to walk through a lounge and bar area to arrive at the front desk. The back door brings guest right the to front desk. When hotel staff saw us coming in the Piccadilly entrance, they immediately took our bags and directed us to the front desk. We arrived at 8am and we stored our luggage with the concierge. The front desk suggested Shepherd's Market for breakfast and we loved this marketplace of shops and bistros just a short stroll from the hotel. The front desk attendant called me on my cell phone during breakfast to let me know my room was ready. We so appreciated that kind attention and the early check-in. The service overall was outstanding. By 10am we were in our executive room and the king bed was split into two twins with one phone call. The room was very comfortable and quite spacious with a sofa, flat screen television, desk, bureau, credenza and mirror w hairdryer and walk-in closet. The bathroom was a large black and white ceramic oasis with a splendid footed tub (great for a hot soak with good hand-held shower), a glass shower stall, a window that actually opened (love that), lots of counter space and a heated towel bar. Two people had plenty of room to set up their toiletries and use this area as a changing room which we did for this father-daughter trip. The heavy drapes in the room totally blacked out any light and the beds were very comfy making it a great place for a nap and perfect for a good night of sleep. After a full day of touring we slept until our wake up call the next day. The Sheraton concierge was very helpful with phone chargers and advice for dining. But it's the location of the Sheraton that makes it so special. The hotel is in the heart of the best of central London and you need go no further than Shepherd's Market for a great array of dining choices: So quaint and lovely. We stayed at the Park Lane for one night and did not dine at the restaurant so I cannot comment on dining services. With so many great choices in London, I don't chose hotels for the food. We did see the gym and there is a lovely lounge where tea was served and cocktails can be ordered. The Park Lane facilities were all very nice and I appreciated that the hotel had a boutique feel about it. This is not a flashy, modern hotel and the Park Lane does not have a Club Lounge. But if you are looking for a hotel with good bones, great personal service in a fantastic location where you can have a great night of sleep- I don't think you need to look much further.

The lounge, restaurant and everything about the hotel is simply lovely. Such great ambiance, live music most nights and nice people. Location-wise this place is perfection. It was our first time in London and it was ideal for getting everywhere. There are two tube stations a short five minute walk, plenty of shops, sights (Buckingham is literally less than a 10 minute stroll across Green Park), and restaurants. Sometimes at night we would just wander around and just be in awe. I would definitely recommend purchasing the breakfast package so you get it every morning.

The May Fair hotel around the corner will not disappoint you in the way this hotel did us. The twin room I booked with my mother was cramped, dated and far from luxurious. The bathroom had cheap plastic fittings, a shower over the bath with a shower curtain that sticks to you when you shower and grubby marks in the bath from wear and tear. The toilet handle was lose when flushed. In the bedroom, there was a hole visible through the curtain lining, a freestanding lamp stood in a position where you had to wrestle with it to look in the dressing table mirror. The decor was grim, old fashioned and not at all pleasing to the eye. We had the impression the room was meant for one person, as there was only one robe in the wardrobe and one set of shampoo/shower gel etc. There were none of the extras you would expect in 5* bathroom such as shower cap, cotton buds etc. We had not been offered a wake up call or a morning newspaper on check-in, the staff member was pleasant enough, but lacked the extra effort you expect from a 5*.

The May Fair hotel is far more flexible and superior on this score. We stuck with the buffet breakfast, which was quite unpleasant, hash browns were undercooked, bacon tasted odd and scrambled egg was tasteless. The coffee was awful and we had to take a trip to Starbucks down the road to make up for it! Overall I am at a loss as to why this hotel is 5*.

We had a deluxe room on the sixth floor that was extremely comfortable. The bath room was about 72 square feet with a stall shower with overhead spray, tub, a double sink of about six feet, magnifying mirror, lots of counter space, heated towel bar. Room with two nightstands with lamps, flat panel t.v., mini bar, safe, chair, desk, small table near a lounge chair. All in all we were extremely comfortable. I guess it's the luck of the draw based on the number of compaints received from others. My wife and I found the maid service, concierge desk and front office to be excellent. The location is absolutely the best. So close to the metro......Green Park. Buy an Oyster Card if you plan on staying in London for close to 5 nights and you will save big bucks on your transfer from Heathrow to the hotel. The cost of the card is about the price of a one way transfer from the airport to the hotel by taxi. The metro is the best way to get around London. We travel with two overhead suitcases and a large camera bag plus my wife's large purse. You don't need much luggage these days.......jeans do the trick in any restaurant we visited. Ties are worn by some men, but they were coming from their office or having business meetings. Tourists dress just liked we do here. Restaurants we visited included (ratings on food, ambiance, & service)....Cost is for two persons for relatively light eaters having one glass of wine for the two of us: Bocca di Lupo 7/7/7 $76; Latium 5/8/8 $114; J Sheekey 7/8/9 $103; Haozhan 8/6/10 $79; Locanda Locatelli 7/9/10 $140. If I went back to London the only retaurant I would return to would be Haozhan.....located at 8 Gerrard Street. The expensive restaurants just weren't worth it. Had a wonderful shrimp dish at Haozhan as an entree and my wife had a vegetarian dish she loved. The fried rice was not great and neither were the egg rolls (too much oil), but the entrees were supurb. We enjoyed London Walks (Famous Square Mile, Old Hampstead....we loved this tour with the owner of London Walks). In addition, we took a train to York and enjoyed the free city walk offered by volunteers.....the train is expensive, but we thought it was worth it. We took a wonderful 1/2 day private tour with Wendy Hammerston (British Museum, Library and Bloomsbury). She can be reached at ----@----------.fsnet.co.uk We particulary enjoyed Starbucks for morning coffee and Pret a Manager for a quick bite (great soup and sandwiches). And finally, if you can get the type of room we had, I know you are going to enjoy your visit to London.

If they are choosing to serve tea in these pots they should really be attentive enough to pour it themselves, I nearly dropped the whole thing at one point it was so hot! The day I visited was quiet with plenty of staff so no excuses.

The business center PCs could not accept my flash drive to print a file, and neither the evening concierge nor the front desk could open my emailed file because they didn't have the proper authorization to access email.

There are two steps - no ramp - from the tiny lobby floor up to the front-desk floor, thus luggage cannot be rolled up. Hotel rooms are the proverbial box of chocolates - some roomy, some cramped. I'm convinced that no two of the turn-of-the-century bathrooms are the same.

On arrival, through the Piccadilly door of the hotel, I struggled with my case through the revolving door and once I gathered my senses after then, I felt a little bit like Paddington bear - lost. There was nobody remotely identifiable as hotel staff to welcome or even direct me to reception. And dear reader, since I had to struggle, so too will you... When I eventually arrived in reception (up some stairs and down some stairs with a suitcase is not much fun) there was KidPop musak playing so loudly that I asked the receptionist if anyone had taken the time to read the reviews here on TA. She nodded, clearly they were aware. I told her I was looking forward to being able to write a better review... \"Musty\" is the word that best describes my room - when I opened the windows onto a laneway, the noise from aircon and other electrical equipment was deafening. So the windows remained closed and hence the mustiness. The whole establishment is shabby and borderline dirty. A manager did call my room to see if everything was ok, but since the phone in my room was not working properly, it was only when i called the operator later that night that he gave me an access code to voicemails. On the website, it looks like a quintessentially British establishment - regrettably it is of an establishment that passed 30 years ago.

Once I found out what hotel I had signed up for I read the reviews and felt a little upset that I had been duped into getting an \"unbeleviable deal\" on a not so great hotel. I contacted Lastminute and explained to them that if the Hotel was as bad as some of the reviews said I would be photographing the hotel, staying elsewhere and disputing the transaction on my credit card. On arrival at the hotel I was pleasantly surprised. I checked in by a courtious young woman and Basil Fawlty was nowhere to be seen. The Hotel is definitely old but I wouldn't say that it is in disrepair. It is clean and it is not musty. The hallways are wide and the floorboards creek when you walk down the hall. The bathroom in my room is clean, with a big bath (it is interesting to see the bath fittings have made in England on them which is not something you see every day). Is it a 5 star? I'm not sure if I could prove that it wasn't or that I even care all that much. So here's the scoop. I have a bit of an insight into this because I remember travelling to Manhattan when the $AU was half that of the $US. If you read most of the negative reviews they are from Americans who feel that the hotel is overpriced and that they were ripped off. Are they wrong? Well from their perspective no. I have every sympathy for people when they feel that the doorman probably earns more than they do in real terms. In fairness the hotel have show great restraint in responding to what are quite vitriolic complaints. To their credit they have not disputed any of the claims made. London was beautiful today, it was sunny and everybody was out enjoying it. This hotel positions you well to get the best out of London. If it was rainy and you were trapped inside the hotel all day there's not much the hotel can do to make that a fun experience. The hotel is not a 2 star hotel. I can assure you because I have stayed in some pretty bad hotels in my day. If you want the \"bright lights and Coca-Cola\" then you should avoid London all together. This makes the question of the Park Lane Sheraton being a 5,4,3 or 2 star hotel moot. Finally all London Hotels charge unreasonable fees for slow/unusable WiFi so be smart and go and buy a prepaid SIM or USB dongle from one of the many cell phone shops in London and get reliable fast Internet at the hotel and on the go for $30-$40 for your whole stay.

To give the hotel its due - it generally got the 'big' things right - service, general cleanliness and front of house. It was the small to medium things that started to add up though. The lift button to call the lift was worn out to the bare plastic below. While not a 'big' thing it did start waving a warning flag in the back of my head. A tightly run ship would not accept this. I was in a first floor room. The carpets looked dated and slightly stained. On entering the room, it felt small and dark (though I was warned by reception that this was one of the last smoke free rooms available and therefore smaller than average. I was offered a larger smoking room but declined since I wasn't confident that there wouldn't be the smell of old cigarette smoke). The basic lighting lacked the sense of either intimacy or grandeur I have experienced in lower starred hotels. The room felt somewhat stuffy, and the aircon was a standalone unit connected by an inelegant hose to the window. The fridge mini-bar didn't seem to be working as the contents didn't seem to be any cooler than room temperature. The room walls had exposed minor repairs of mounting points, possibly for pictures, but had been hastily polyfillered and not even painted over. The bathroom was very dated with old spotted marble floors, a large mirror but the silvering having seen better days, and an average size bath with shower hose fitting. Unlike other reviewers I did have plenty of high powered hot water for the shower. The bed was a good point - queen size, comfortable with crisply made clean sheets and plenty of pillows. But...make sure you bring ear plugs to get a quiet night's sleep. Even though I stayed on a Thursday night, there was a thumping beat from a disco going on downstairs somewhere, conversations overheard from neighbouring rooms and from people wandering down the corridor and occasional faint smells of 'chemicals'/'dry electricals'. The curtains in the morning weren't very light secure either. I didn't bother with breakfast as frankly, for over \u00a320 to have just fruit juice, tea/coffee, porridge and a roll was beginning to irritate. So, in conclusion, wonderful location, great place to meet in the bar, but unless you can get a very good price for a room then don't bother.", "Date": "March 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely old world hotel but in need of renovation\u201d", "Author": "rejoyce1976", "ReviewID": "UR99664691", "Content": "I booked this hotel as a \"Top Secret Hotel\" on lastminute.com. I knew what hotel it was before booking and was just trying to save a bit on price. It is a 5 star Hotel and we got it for \u00a3159, so I suppose it was ok value. The location is super, 4 mins walk from Green Park tube and right on Green Park. THE GOOD The reception was very good, we were duly welcomed and I would say given as good a welcome as SPG members, the checkin was very good. The concierge service was excellent, as were the porters. This is the type of stuff you love in a 5 star hotel, they were so helpful! Our room was very nice, it had high ceilings and was fitted out with lovely furniture. We requested a baby cot/crib and a porter was along within minutes with the cot. The Lobby / Bar of the Hotel is magnificent, its got a arched ceiling and is full of old world charm, I was very happy to welcome some friends and family here for a drink as an apr\u00e9ro. The restaurant onsite is called Citrus and I found it to be great (at the price we paid). We booked a table for 6 through toptable.com and got 50% off the food. I think if I was paying the full price for the food I would not have been as happy. THE BAD The hotel is a bit dated, this is first noted in the corridors, the 1st floor corridors were pretty horrible, awful carpet and a strong smell of chlorine, I'm not sure if there's a swimming pool somewhere, but it smelt like it. I am used to paying above average for drinks in a 5* hotel bar, but the Park Lane was exorbitant. I felt like a beer (as you often do in England), they had no beer on draft, which seems ridiculous for a 5 star hotel and they were charging about \u00a35.50 for a 330ml bottle of beer. I also noticed on the wine list they were selling E. Guigal C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne wine for \u00a340 a bottle. I recently bought this wine for \u20ac5.50 in France and I think this was a too much of a markup for an quite average wine, the hotel were most likely buying it for less. Our bathroom was not in a good condition. The tiling was old, awful and poorly done whenever it was last tiled (probably at least 20 years ago). On the 1st morning there was obviously some water problem as the hot water was running brown and was also not very hot. I showered in it, using only the hot tap, thinking back if they had rectified the problem during this time I would probably have been scalded. In all their bathrooms need a lot of attention. Then again, if they did this they could probably charge \u00a3200 per night. The minibar fridge did not work and indeed the door of it did not even stay closed, but instead had to be held closed with a Sheraton sticker. The hotel is not really that accessible. If you come in the front you have to go down a short flight of stairs and then have to go up a bigger flight of stair to go to the reception. It is possible to enter \"around the back\" without any stairs, but I didn't see anybody or any sign advising of this. Perhaps this is something they'll have to work on for the 2012 Olympics, Green Park Station is in the process of putting in 3 lifts for the same reason. On the 1st morning Housekeeping knocked on our door at 7:20am. We had a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door and I was quite annoyed to be woken up this early. He said \"Housekeeping\" and then \"Sorry, wrong room\", this should not happen.

There is NO WAY this is a 5 star hotel, We've stayed in better 3 star hotels. I feel very strongly that Lastminute have completely misrepresented this place. On a positive note to begin with, our room (246) was a good size and the bed was large and comfortable. On the negative, it was dark and smelled musty. The view was of walls and windows very close by. The carpets and fittings were dated and dingy. The air conditioning was a large free standing unit near the window, with a hose connected to the outside , which we didn't use because it was so noisy. No tea/coffee making facilities, no robes/slippers. The bathroom was appalling! It reminded me of the facilities at my boarding school back in the seventies....sit up straight bath, weird tiles, dirty grout, wooden toilet seat...no shower gel, no shower cap, no sewing kit or vanity set......definitely not 5 or even 4 star! However to be fair, the water was hot and plentiful, and the towels were fine. In the morning this was a very noisy spot....we began to think people were slamming doors on purpose!!

We phoned reception from our car and were told to 'drive the wrong way down a one road' to the back of the hotel to access their garage as the correct road was closed due to roadworks - unbelievable that they would recommend this to a guest! When we entered the hotel, we had to wait 20 mins to check in. My partner decided to upgrade us to an executive room and here's where the real fun started. The 1st room had peeling paint and shabby, dated furniture so we asked to be moved. The 2nd room was dingy too so we asked to be moved again. The 3rd room was more contemporary but the bathroom was dirty - green mould on an electrical cover and black mould round the sink mastic and secondary double glazing; furthermore no extractor fan so once you'd had a shower the mirrors, windows and ceramic tiling were dripping with condensation - so much so, that both of us slipped when we got out the shower - unsafe. Furthermore, there were black mould patches on the bathroom ceiling. We were so fed up we didn't bother asking to move yet again, we thought we'd try to make the most of it. No bathrobes as one would expect from a 5 star executive room! We rang down for some and were provided with 2 particularly grubby towelling robes, frayed, worn and feeling like cardboard - goodness knows how many people had worn them previously. Next, we found there was no complimentary shower/body wash so off my partner went to the local Tesco express for supplies - once again, not very 5 star! Saturday evening, we asked if the inclusive breakfast could be taken in our room the following morning..yes we were told as long as we paid a covercharge. Fine we said. Sunday morning arrives and the waitress lays out the breakfast then asks us to sign for a \u00a350 bill! No way we said, we were told last night we could have it in our room for a small surcharge. So my partner had to ring down once again and complain - at least they had the decency not to charge us as we had been misinformed. Check out was another 20 minute wait and when I handed the receptionist my feedback card and advised her we were really unhappy with our stay and could we have Sheraton's head office address, we were told no and she merely handed us the evening Manager's business card - she was downright rude in her attitude and couldn't care less that we'd had such a disappointing stay.

I have to huff my bags from the main entrance all the way to the front desk. Once I make it to the front desk, the bellman asks me if I would like a hand with my luggage. The room is in dire need of a make-over. The tub has rust stains and the atmosphere is quite depressing. I immediately get on the internet (which works well) to see if the hotel is haunted. Thankfully, it is not. :) I am happy to find a stocked mini-bar as I am very thirsty from huffing my bags around the hotel. Day 2: Fire alarm goes off at 6:30 am. I rush to the lobby in my pj's. I have the honor of being filmed by some tourist who wanted to capture the event on video. If it ever makes it to youtube - I am the one in the blue pj's. After 20 mins, there are no announcements made and eventually we assume we can go back to our rooms. We have tea at the hotel (very good) and listen to harp covers of the beatles and michael jackson (she is very talented). As my manager and I begin to chat, I find out that he has experienced fire alarms here each of his 3 visits. Interesting. Long waits to use elevator as one of them always seems to be out of order. Day 3: After several days of walking in bad shoes, I go down to the concierge and explain i have a blister and ask if they have a band-aid. He suggests I walk 10 blocks to the nearest pharmacy. The manager of the hotel reads my first post on Trip Advisor (which was deleted) and has someone call me to look at other rooms. I did not take advatage of their offer, but I really appreciated this gesture as it did suggest they care about their customers. Day 4: Time to check out! Overall: The location was great!

I happen to live very locally (one mile away) - I stayed here because there is heavy building work in my house and on Valentines day the last thing I wanted was to return to my dusty abode without hot water. Anyway, I did as many seem to have done - booked the hotel, found out which one it was, went straight to tripadvisor and became rather apprehensive. So I emailed management, as many seem to have done, and was told that they understood my concerns and would pick a \"nice\" room for me. This was done by placing me in a room on the 8th floor which, albeit apparently refurbished, was next to the customer lift shaft and the double staff lift shaft. I did see others on here complain about lift noises and think they may have been overreacting perfectionists, but the mechanics made for a loud, constant and annoying noise. I asked to change rooms and the staff were obliging, placing us on a different floor away from any lifts, though this move saw us relocate from a partially refurbished room to one of the older rooms. It was something of a downgrade. We asked to be moved again and were eventually placed on a top floor room overlooking the park - this was nice, but nothing to write home about. I can write about the quality of the hotel comparatively - I have gone for a secret hotel on Piccadilly before and ended up with The Athenaeum; that was a five star hotel undoubtedly. The Sheraton Park Lane Hotel is for some reason inexplicably dated and not well maintained. Old carpet, dating fixtures and furnishings, cracked plug sockets, no visible reception at the main Piccadilly entrance (there was another couple also stumped as where to check in and wondering around with us cluelessly, for the main entrance hall is unmanned). The staff were nice and attentive and did eventually find a solution, but this shouldn't have been the case especially as I got in touch in advance. When there are other more moden and clean hotels dotted around within a square mile radius, even 3 or 4 star boutique hotels at a simialr price, it is just a pain to have fallen for what appeared to be a five star hotel when money really would have been better spent on something which lives up to its star rating. I do not believe that tripadvisor should be used to be petty and put old B&B owners out of business, but where the hotel is part of a global and successful chain and is advertised as being a five star rating, a rant is justifiable if that hotel fails to attain the standards one would hope for.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cReally good experience at this hotel\u201d", "Author": "PhilAC", "ReviewID": "UR96549600", "Content": "I booked this hotel the night before using Lastminutes 'top-secret' hotel promotion.

I never saw more than two people behind the front desk. Was assigned a room on the first floor, which was fortunate as it seemed the lift was broken. The rooms are spacious but poorly layed out, and not very clean. To add to the worst parts, the toilet wouldn't flush properly. Housekeeping carts were in the hallway the whole time I stayed there. The floor was creaking the whole time and I could hear people walking around at all hours of the night. And despite being in a non-smoking room, the hallway smelled overwhemingly of smoke. Upon leaving for the airport, the concierge assured me the taxi accepted credit cards. He seemed to be very friendly with the taxi driver, but of course when I get to Heathrow the taxi won't accept a credit card, and I had to find an ATM machine to pay for the ride. The location of this hotel is very good, but there are plenty of other options in the area so no reason to stay here.

This is an old London hotel that was bought by Sheraton I *think* a few years back. The good: the service and the location were great. The bad: the lobby. What lobby?!?! Heaven forbid you plan on meeting colleagues or friends in the lobby- there's nowhere to stand, sit, or wait with out looking weird. Also the rooms and hallways are kind of dingy. In their day I'm sure they looked nice and flowed with the British feel of the hotel. But now, its just kind of shabby. This is definitely not a 5 star hotel. 4, sure. But not 5. My first night I was in room 819, which was nice and large. BUT happened to be right next to the room service elevator. Basically, the night before a big meeting, I got zero sleep. But this is when the good service came into play- I called the front desk and asked if I could be moved, and while I was out during the day, they move me and my luggage to another room. For the duration of my stay I was in 714 which was nice. It was very big, had high ceilings, and a couch. No view, and still dingy, but totally quiet. Next time I go back for work and have to stay here, I am requesting this room. Also, their beds are not sweet sleeper beds, fyi. I wouldnt recommend this hotel only because I think it's a little pricey for what you get. I had a really successful hotwire experience in London with the hotel I stayed in after the Sheraton, and it was much more reasonable price-wise.

Disappointing selection of cakes etc. No strawberry jam with the scones. Member of staff who dealt with each course was efficient, but not friendly. Used the toilets - a walk downstairs and along corridors for the men - even further for the ladies. Ladies discovered when they found the toilets they had been directed to by the staff, that they were closed. Staff nearby told them to go all the way back and use elsewhere. When a complaint was made to them about the length of walk, they were grudingly allowed to use the toilets in the banqueting suite. Tired and stained porcelain, not what you expect from an advertised five star hotel. Palm Court used as a cut through by residents to the reception area - suit-cases dragged through whilst having tea, not very pleasant. Dress code advertised as smart casual - not enforced at all, seems that the management prefer \"wear what you like\". Overall, I would say that this hotel is one to avoid - much better service and meal elsewhere.

The first was Le Meridien in the heart of the west-end of London and now The Park Lane Sheraton. Both supposedly five-star hotels and both SPG , Sheraton group. I stayed two nights at the Park Lane Sheraton, a dated, shabby place with complacent staff and management and very poor standards. A total lack of an eye for detail; as long as it looks good from a distance it must be OK.! Upon arrival I checked in and went to my room, an executive room (641). I am a regular user of Sheraton brand (Platinum level frequent guest) and have experienced some of the best Sheraton hotels in the world and in this case one of the worst. The carpets were filthy, actually black around the edges and under the doors when you opened them. The curtains were so old they were actually falling apart The desk-lamp shade was old and had been burned brown by the bulb The furniture was scratched and battered and worn out Even the information cards on the desk were dog-eared. No matter, on my first night, I decided it was too late to change rooms, in any case, despite three calls to \u201cGuest Services\u201d I could not get a reply from the Duty Manager. Requests for a call-back were ignored. I ordered room service which arrived within the allowed 30 minutes. The waiter left a corkscrew for my wine, I would have expected him at least to have offered to open it for me and check it for soundness. In most Sheraton hotels I have experienced (except this one), those staying in Executive rooms get a complimentary breakfast, not here. There is no executive lounge, no complimentary evening snacks. Not even a free newspaper. With regard to restaurants, I tried The Citrus. The in-room information says it opens at 5.30pm, this is wrong, it opens an hour later, so a wasted journey at 6pm for an early dinner. I returned at 6.30pm and was offered a limited choice of table as it was very busy; reception did not advise me to reserve a table when I checked in. The food was very average, don\u2019t worry Michelin doesn\u2019t feature here! The chefs \u201cGourmet Pizza\u201d was an overcooked, dried up affair with some wilted rocket leaves thrown on it. I needed to use the business centre for a small printing job. It was unmanned so no-one to assist. However one of concierges helped out which was good. After some heavy complaining, (I interviewed the duty manager eventually), on my second night I was moved to a large suite overlooking the park, (however it was dark!). But the thought was good. It was a lovely suite, although newly gloss painted (perhaps that day?) so I had to sleep with heavy paint solvent fumes, as opening the window let in too much ice-cold air. I had a headache from this by the next morning. I looked forward to a nice hot soak in the big bath, but sadly water did not come out of the taps at all and it was not possible to fill it up with the hand-held bath shower. I used the ordinary shower instead but the water pressure was rather poor. So that\u2019s it then! All in all, perhaps I should have read the Trip Advisor reports before booking this one. I naively assumed that Sheraton Brand would be good. Not so this time. At the time of writing, out of some 579 reviews, over 60% of reviews are \u201caverage\u201d or worse, almost 36% are \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cterrible\u201d and 16% are actually \u201cterrible\u201d. This is not good enough for a supposedly top flight hotel in the West End of London. It\u2019s a disgrace.

Of course, prior to trip, I read reviews and was horrified at the low ratings...not to mention overly concerned about what to expect. We arrived at hotel at 9 am coming from overseas. Were told by a female clerk that our room wasn't ready, however, it shouldn't be long. Family and myself went to Palm Court lobby to relax and when I checked back about 1 1/2 hours later, was told by another female clerk that room still wasn't ready. There was gentlemen clerk by the name of Christian who kept whispering to other 2 women clerks there about check in times and ensuring that no room was given out prior to 3pm. Being a preferred Starwood guest, I was very upset. I left and came back about 1 pm to see if our room was ready. Christian, the male clerk, told me (after whispering to a couple of other employees) that the dryer had broken and therefore linens were not being provided for the beds so it could be a few more hours. At this point, I'm steaming. I mentioned to him that that was a lame excuse and I was very disappointed at the way they were handling early checkins. However, I was more than glad to add to their poor reviews on trip advisor as soon as I got a chance. I went back tot he lobby with my little girls to wait. About 10 minutes later, Christian came over to tell me that miraculously, the dryers had been fixed and our room was being prepared. We got up to our one-bedroom suite. While it was warm and comfortable, the furniture was very outdated and the decor was very poor. Throughout our 5 day stay, we didn't spend much time in the room to allow it to bother us. Overall, the rest of our experience there was uneventful. I loved the location of this hotel (Starbucks nearby, walking distance from Piccadilly Circus and other London highlights), however, not sure I'd stay here again.

As I had booked the hotel as a surprise for my husband to celebrate our anniversary I was very worried and contacted the hotel manager by e-mail. He responded staright away and re-assured me that he would do everything he could to make our anniversary special. Upon arrival at the hotel we were told that we had been upgraded. The service at the front desk was very good and when we reached our room, the front desk rang to make sure we were happy. The room was very spacious for London standards and had a great view over Green Park. As there were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room, we contacted Room Service and asked for a tray to be brought up. This arrived within 10 minutes however not only did we receive the tea tray, we also received a bottle of champagne and two glasses as it was our anniversary ! The hotel is old but I would far rather this than a minimalist, modern hotel. The bar area is beautiful and we were disappointed that we didn;t have more time so we could have a drink / afternoon tea. I genuinely believe that the manager cares about the bad reviews on this site, as he made an extra special effort to make our visit special, which it was. Finally, the location was fantastic.

When we checked in I asked if the executive room overlooked the park as we had requested when booking with the travel agents - was told none were available today but possibly in 2 days! - I asked if there were any other rooms available with a Park view for 2 nights, I was told 2 types of suites at such and such a cost. We decided to have a look at the room we had been allocated to see if we could put up with it for 2 nights and also to look at the cheaper of the 2 suites and then make a decision. We were able to do this and found that the 'executive' room we had been allocated was really awful - small, dark and very unappealing, the junior suite was light, overlooked the park and had plently of space. As the junior suite was going to cost approx. \u00a350.00 extra per night, it was a no brainer for us as we had already paid \u00a31125.00 for the holiday and opted for the junior suite for the night and then to move into an exec. room overlooking the park the following day. We shouldn't have had to pay an extra \u00a3100 but didn't want to compromise my enjoyment for my special birthday. However when we got settled in to the junior suite we found that there was only one robe and no slippers - not what you would expect of a 5 star hotel.

This time there was only one robe and no slippers and no tra and coffee tray. After advising housekeeping, these were delivered about an hour later. Hairdresser - although advertised as open was always closed. Good points: nice breakfast, good cocktails in the lounge, in a good position on Picadilly.

The Reception staff were friendly, politeand very efficient; Housekeeping were unobtrusive, but did a great job, Waiting staff were very attentive and pleasant The room was excellent - very clean, welcoming, comfortable, bright and spacious. The location is ideal; Two hundred yards from Regent Street. One hundred yards from a Tube station and Green Park - which lead onto Buckingham Palace entrance; and two minutes to Hyde Park.

The king bed was hard and by all appearances, rather worn. It was dipped in the middle. The pillows were all super soft so we asked for a foam or at least a firm pillow. When the guy came with just one pillow it was exactly the same at the others. When my husband called again he was told that those were all that were available. That was really a disappointment. The Westin always has a pillow menu to choose from. The really frustrating part of our stay was the not so lovely noise from the ballroom. The first night around 11pm I heard loud music and bass. I first thought it was coming from the nearby flats. After about 15 minutes I had enough and my husband called to ask if there was a function going on. The night manager said there was a wedding in the ballroom. When we asked if they could please tell the DJ to turn the music down so we(on the 7th floor no less) could please sleep. The manager was very flippant and told my husband that it would be off at midnight. He couldn't care less that we couldn't sleep. There is no excuse for that much noise that far from the party. He claimed that no one else from the 7th floor had complained. Well, I can guarantee you that if we could hear it on the 7th floor, the floors below must have had it much worse. My husband was pissed. The next day I noticed that there was a sign for yet another wedding that night. Guess what? 11pm and the music started again! So now we're on night two of no sleep. It was ridiculous. When I made the reservation to stay I never was told that a lack of sleep was part of my stay. Something needs to be done about the noise coming from the ballroom. I can assure you that this isn't a random occurance. I know for a fact that the ballroom is a very busy place and the noise must be a constant at this hotel. I would stay here again, but if I could be guaranteed that I didn't have to listen to someone's party going on.

Room service was a bit slow when we requested a bucket of ice, but they were accomodating when we needed silverware for take out food we brought in with us. The rooms were spacious (between my firends and I, we stayed in two rooms). One was very large with a couch. Both rooms were old and the rugs looked like they could use a good steam cleaning, but otherwise everything was clean.

We generally didn't have a problem getting as many codes as we needed (though one bartended told me once that you could only get a code if you bought something) and they lasted for more than one hour.

There's normally an admission fee, but the organizer let us in for free as guests of the hotel. There were only two problems that we had.

The Park Lane is located in an excellent part of London with great access to the Underground. However, the rooms can only be described as comfortable at best; far from what we expected for the price. The rooms are more comparable to an average Best Western or Holiday Inn in the United States which is the most generous complement I can give. Further, we found the staff at the reception to be aloof, disconnected, and uninterested in meeting the needs of its clientele.

Indeed, the location is the best aspect of this hotel, which is in serious need of extensive updating, especially in the guest rooms. Common areas look slightly better. There is an adequate restaurant and salon for afternoon tea, but prices are not much less than far better places to dine or have tea nearby. The food was mediocre at best. We ate only one meal and had one drink after dinner - but far prefered to eat elsewhere. Our biggest disappointment was the room. We booked an \"executive room\" but the room looked out onto a noisy back road (Brick Street) and was located next to the service elevator, so we could hear room service carts and maid service at all times of the day.

On two days our room had still not been cleaned/made up as of 5 in the afternoon, despite our having been gone all day. The concierge desk was also lacking. One concierge flat out said we'd have better luck trying for ourselves to get into a particular restaurant than for him to help us. Another concierge recommended enthusiastically a bus tour which turned out to be ghastly, simply wretched.

There was no porter to help with the bags or to ask directions. Although it was 1:45 pm, they told me that the room would not be availablel until 3 pm. It was then ready at 3:30 pm. I had reserved a superior room becasue I wanted a slightly larger room at a rate of 389 British Pounds per night plus tax. Many times I get an upgrade as a gold SPG member, but in this property not even an acknowledgement. After waiting for alomost 2 hours, when I finally got to my room it was one of the smallest rooms that I had ever stayed in my life. I travel over 50% of the year. When I asked to get the room type that I reserved, they told me that it would not be available until after 6 pm, since I had a business meeting I told them I could not wait. So they offered to give me 2000 Starwood Points, and no relief on the price. There were no amenities in the bathroom ( shampoo, soap, etc.). Half hour after I requested that these items be brought to the room the maid delivered them. The room was hot and smelly, the AC knob was broken and one could not tell if the cold air was at maximun. But there was hardly any air coming out of it. Even the porter that finally brought the lagguage upstairs commented that the room was extremely small and apologetically suggested that I should ask for a larger one. The room was very tired, the carpet and the chair at the work desk were stained,The hotel overall was old (elevators made all kind of noises) and overall it had a musty smell. The service continued to be very poor, even through the check out, where a 3 other guests were checking out and only one person was at the desk. They never asked how my stay was. It was a terrible stay, the service was bad, the property was bad. It is s shame that it is part of the starwood group of hotels.The only thing going for them is the location near the center, but there are many other hotels that are a lot better in the same location.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cWhat a shame...\u201d", "Author": "Renery", "ReviewID": "UR73668689", "Content": "As noted by others, the location of this hotel is ideal. I have stayed there 3 or 4 times in the past. Each time we used Starwood points, and each time the quality of the rooms has gone down. As noted, the furniture is mismatched and old, past the \"quaint\" stage. Same experience schlepping down steps and through the unattended lobby and the bar/tea room, then up more steps. No assistance offered and no bellman at the door that should be the arrivals. More comments: 1. The room we were given for three people (father, mother & 11 yr old son) barely had enough room to walk around the three single beds. To get into the bathroom we had to slide the rollaway bed in one direction and to open the closet door we had to slide it in the other direction. To get past the rollaway we had to turn sideways and risk bumping the TV cabinet. This must definitely be a fire code violation. 2. I inquired about a larger room, but was told at 9 in the morning upon arrival that all the rooms were full and there were no \"upgrades\" available. 3. The portable air conditioner is very unsatisfactory because of the noise. It had a hose which was vented through the window. These portable air conditioners get hot and are a fire waiting to happen. 4. The bedding was not up to the standards of other Sheratons where we've stayed. 5. The woman at the front desk with a French accent was dismissive and not sympathetic (bordering on rude) when I asked her about changing our room. She noted that we were, after all, staying on points. 6. The carpet was threadbare, spotted and stained. 7. The bathtub was so old that the porcelain had worn through to reveal a dark spot under the drain. 8. The floors on the 3rd floor creaked with every step, as noted by another guest. 9. A red vacuum cleaner sat in the hall for 3 days in the same place (next to our door). 10. Etc., etc. You get the point. In all, the room was a sub-standard Sheraton room, certainly not in keeping with other Sheratons where we've had the opportunity to stay. Perhaps next time we're in London we'll try the Le Meridien.

With French airport workers being on strike we had to go around France! I was happy to see the hotel had an excellent location between Piccadilly and Knightsbridge, so easy to get to anywhere. It was about 930pm when I arrived and it was not apparent which door was the entrance, so eventually I found one that opened and struggled through it with 2 bags. I eventually found that the main entrance is in a small back street, but as there were no staff to advise at the Piccadilly entrance, I had to guess. So the entrance I entered was through the bar. It looked quite nice in an olde world way, unfortunately smelled old too. So after more struggling to get through more doors I continued the struggle up some stairs after searching in vain for a ramp. No help offered and bad luck if you are in a wheel chair. Even worse luck if there was an emergency and you had to leave quickly in a wheel chair! The health and safety people should have a field day with this place! So to check in, quite normal except I had a trainee who had to double-check each aspect of the procedure with her colleague. No problem until I had been mistakenly allocated a smoking room. I detest smoking so I requested another room and was told the hotel was full. I asked that they resolve the problem and after insisting and waiting eventually was given another non-smoking room. Seems it wasn\u2019t full after all! I was then asked for my credit card as normal and I explained that I will pay cash for all expenses. The next morning I received a message from my bank advising of an unauthorized transaction of \u00a3225 GBP. My room had been paid in advanced with accrued points, so what was this? I immediately contacted reception to get clarification, they said indeed it was them. I then asked that they unblock the transaction and I left a cash deposit in advance of \u00a3150 GBP, as I did not intend to spend anything other than on internet access (which incidentally was charged at \u00a316 GBP per day) and would pay cash immediately for anything I purchased. The reception staff member assured me that the credit card transaction had been immediately annulled. So after approximately 8 attempts and 6 days later with international phone calls to hotel, bank, emails, attempts by a well-intentioned but ineffective assistant manager to resolve the issue (I only received a return call by threatening to make drama after being ignored and the original problem remaining), my credit card still remains blocked! I continue to get the same \u2018it is the bank not the hotel\u2019 story, but this rings a little thin. It is not difficult to put in place a system in a hotel in a 5-star international chain that works. This system does not work and I am not happy about it. So to the room. After passing a hallway which yielded loud squeaks with each step I got to the room. It was musty and hot, so I first tried to open windows in the room and bathroom \u2013 they were old and deteriorated and opened maybe 5cm with difficulty \u2013 so I searched for the air conditioner which was an old portable model on the floor partially obscured under the curtains and attached to a hole in the window via a flexible tube. I turned it on and it was so loud that I decided to put up with the heat instead. It was a health hazard and an accident waiting to happen. The furniture was old, there were insufficient power outlets for computer, phone, etc without pulling out other electrical items on the floor and the outlet in the bathroom didn\u2019t work \u2013 there was not even one available to fit the wheezing old hairdryer which was hidden in the cupboard. The carpet smelled weird. Paint was peeling off in places, same in the bathroom. The toilet refused to flush, but eventually worked after about 10 attempts. When I turned on the water in the bath it had a strong flow, but when changed to the shower, it dribbled out like it had a prostate problem. After stepping out of the shower I discovered a door stop placed ergonomically perfectly in the middle of the floor to break your toe. It didn\u2019t break, but it hurt. The towels were stacked perfectly on the towel rail with the large one you needed at the bottom, so the others on top would then fall dutifully onto the floor. On attempting sleep I heard the squeaking floor outside the door and strange noises from a nearby room which were not entertaining. In the morning the light for the elevator button was not working and didn\u2019t work during the whole stay. I could go on, but really the conclusion is obvious. This hotel needs a rethink. It is quite obviously well below 5-star standard and even obvious health and safety standards. The credit card situation is not acceptable and is still unresolved. It is disorganized and not clean enough. I cannot recommend anything other than the great location. I will be sending this letter to Sheraton, Starwood, the hotel\u2019s manager and others. It is not good enough.

There was no mirror over the dressing table - and the hairdryer flex was not long enough to reach the wardrobe mirror. The lobby on floor 8 creaked the whole way along.

The room was approximately 270 square feet. The best way to get there if you don't have too much luggage is to buy an underground Oyster pass......We paid approximately $45 each for the week and took about 6-8 trips per day and went to and from the airport. Take the Green Park exit and you are about 4 blocks from the hotel. This is the first time we travelled with overhead luggage (2 bags) plus a large camera bag and large purse. A taxi from the airport to the hotel would have been $90 .......$180 round trip. We paid $90.00 for the Oyster cards and had five days of travel within the city too. Best deal in town. The best way to go around town and for airport transfers. The location of the hotel is the best. This was our 19th trip to London. Back to the hotel......the bath room was about 72 square feet. It had a stall shower with an overhead spray (not too popular with the ladies), a double sink of about six feet, magnified mirror, lots of counter space, a heated towel bar. The room had two nightstands with lamps, flat panel t.v., mini bar, safe, chair, desk, dressing table, small table near a large chair. The furnishing is a bit on the tired side, but much better than we expected. Staff was wonderful.....concierge staff, maids, front desk......all combined to make a great vacation in an exciting city. Restaurants we visited included: Bocca di Lupo (B+), Tentazioni (B), Clos Maggiore (B), Mildred for vegetarians (B-), Haozhan (Chinese) (A-).........our best meal in London. Skip the desert. We enjoyed our tour of the Globe Theater. Borough Market was nice to see. Bought some cheese and bread and took it to coffee houses for three days in a row.....just like being in Paris.

The whole trip was wonderful (in spite of the ash clouds) and the hotel was a huge part of that. HOTEL: The hotel itself is one of the old grand English buildings on Piccadilly street, that gives an overall aristocratic feel. However once you enter the lobby, it has a certain \"boutique hotel\" atmosphere, with more personalized service and attention than you would get at one of the larger hotels in the area. The check-in process was smooth, and Christian at the front desk was more than accomodating. My husband was arriving later in the day, and I was worried how he will get a room key, but Christian took care of all that. I read reviews from others and I do not agree with their complaints about the hotel appearance. It is a historic building and you have to expect that it will not be the same as staying at a brand new \"chain hotel\" building. Everything was in working order, the bathrooms were lovely, the rooms were well decorated and had a coffee maker in each room. among other amenities. LOCATION: Cannot ask for more! Across the street from Green Park and a few minutes walk to Hyde Park. Lecister square and Soho are a lovely 15 min walk away, which meant we were close to Waterstones bookstore, movie theaters, West End, theaters, amazing restaurants (Nobu is a couple of blocks down and the lively and active Shepards Market is in the neighborhood behind the hotel, literally 2 min walk away). Buckingham palace is just a quick stroll through Green Park. St. James (which I was introduced to only on this trip) is a 5 min walk down the road. Not to mention Mayfair in all its glory, the fabulous shops of Bond street, Saville Row, and Regent street all within walking distance less than 15 min away! For those who prefer the Tube, Green Park station is just around the corner. There is a Marks and Spencer supermarket a couple of blocks down too (important if you have kids along on the trip). SERVICE: Absolutely wonderful. All the staff were extremely gracious and helpful. Sahil at the concierge desk did a phenomenal job in securing us exactly the ticket seat locations we wanted for the theater. He also was very helpful every day in giving us directions and helpful hints. He is among one of the best concierges I have come across in all my travels. FOOD: We were outside the hotel on most days, so we only sampled the food for dinner on one of our evenings and it was very good. The tea lounge in the hotel was always packed, so it must be good although I didnt have a chance to try it unfortunately.

If what matters is being really central, AND you can get it at the right price (think 3 star), then this is for you. If you want that real 5 star experience, don't stay here, you will, unfortunately, be massively disappointed.", "Date": "March 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newton, MA", "Title": "\u201cTerrific Location, Bring Your Earplugs\u201d", "Author": "oldhousegirl", "ReviewID": "UR58089394", "Content": "I had stayed at this hotel a few years ago and was pleased to see that at least some of the rooms had been upgraded. I was upgraded to an Executive Room, so I'm not sure about the others, but my room was big and comfortable. My big complaint, though (and then memories came flooding back of why I had changed rooms during a previous stay), is that the hotel is very noisy. Not street noise, but just poor design. The doors are very heavy, and they slam shut. So any time anyone comes or goes on your floor, or the floor above, you know about it. The hotel wasn't even that full, but it was impossible to get rest without earplugs. The room service cart was rolling up and down the halls, dishes and glasses all clanging together, and the room service delivery person's phone kept ringing and ringing and ringing (I don't know why he didn't pick it up). I could hear every conversation in the hall, and it seemed there were quite a few children running up and down (and you hear every footstep). I got out of bed 5 times to see what was going on. Until I put in ear plugs it was impossible to rest, and then I had the anxiety of missing my early morning wake up call. The bed is very comfortable. The location is terrific, right across from Green Park and just a block from the Green Park Tube and a short walk to everything. The staff was very nice and polite. The prices for all hotel dining are outrageous, and why bother anyway with so many excellent options in walking distance. London hotel prices overall are overpriced, so while I think this hotel would be overpriced in any other city it is really a reasonable value by comparison. It is one of very few hotels I've experience in the UK (where I have traveled extensively over the past 20 years) that doesn't have a total disaster of a shower situation -- i.e. they have managed to design a bath/shower that doesn't completely flood or wet the bathroom floor. That alone is surely worth a few extra pounds and worth a return visit (I just booked for a fall visit). The closet is enormous, which is great if you're staying a few days. I'm not crazy about having to either walk through the Palm Court or use the odd side street entrance, but that's really only a bother when checking in and out.

Like Judge Smail's wife in Caddyshack (Rodney Dangerfield said to her \"You must have been something before the war!\"), this property has some faded charm but is in serious need of a facelift. Sheratons are the weak link in the Starwood chain as most are over-priced, dated and have little style. Supplying the same designer soap as their Westin and W hotels brethren is not enough. The Park Lane features an excellent location on Green Park (next to Hyde Park) in classy Mayfair and is steps from 2 tube stops, Piccadilly Circus and is walking distance to Soho and the Thames, but suffers from a worn out interior, an odd lobby plan (the lobby faces an alley in the back and if you get dropped off out front on Piccadilly St. you'll have to walk with your bags through a formal tea room up and down steps. If you stay here, ask to get dropped off on Brick St., the alley). As a Starwood Gold Preferred Guest, I got a suite, but it was a weird double room layout with a small living room and small bedroom with an ancient bathroom in between, on the first floor floor facing noisy Piccadilly St. I asked to be moved to a one room suite, which was very large and had an updated bathroom but was located next to a very noisy elevator that clanged all night. They were totally booked, so I remained there. On the surface, the room looked pretty grand but upon closer inspection you'll see peeling wallpaper, sloppy caulk, gaps in the moulding, worn carpet, etc. This is somewhat standard for English hotels (and homes) in my experience. Probably the result of sloppy union laborers. Another peeve is the price of internet access. It cost 18 pounds a day or 50 pounds for the whole week. When you pay about $400 a day (265 pounds) free internet would be nice. I did manage a look at one of the standard rooms and they were pretty bleak, especially the bathrooms. Euro gripe: Why can't Europe figure out how to configure a simple shower without confusing knobs, hoses and insufficient splash guards. On the plus side, the bed, as is the norm at Starwood, was plush and as \"heavenly\" as advertised and the staff was friendly and helpful to the extreme. And unlike most UK hotels, the heat worked well. Can't vouch for the A/C, as it was winter. I didn't experience the afternoon \"High Tea\" in the Palm Room but did sample the bar which was disappointing for its lack of English beer. The snack menu was good and the Thai plate (spring rolls, Thai sausage, chicken satay) was welcome at midnight when I arrived, as local pubs close at 11:00 or so. Bottom line is that if it weren't for the Starwood points that I earned for my week's stay here (they were running a quadruple points special!)

We've stayed at the Le Meridien at Piccadilly several times and this was our third time at the Sheraton. We travel to London often for business, but generally try to extend our stay through the weekend to enjoy the city. We felt we got a reasonable deal, especially since we stayed for 4 nights which offered a further discount plus 4x the starwood points. Unfortunately, once again, we were not impressed with this supposed 5-star hotel and I think we're done considering Starwood for our frequent trips to London. Don't get me wrong, the hotel has a nice central location, walking distance to shopping, theatres and restaurants. The public spaces are nice, however the hotel is rather oddly organised -- entering from Piccadilly street you need to walk through the restaurant to get to the rather unassuming lobby area. There is always someone to open the door for you and generally taxis are waiting. I usually check in late after work, often after 11pm and I'm not sure if it's just the night staff, but they're never friendly, barely saying 2 words to me before handing me my key. I found the same to be true of the other staff we encountered. Calling down to the concierge around 8am on a Sunday morning had me waiting through at least 30 rings before being answered (this is after being transferred from the front desk). I've stayed at plenty of 5-star hotels and generally it's a requirement to be friendly, but every time we walked in the hotel we were never greeted with a simple, 'good evening' from the concierge. As the entrance area is so small, it's almost awkward that they don't say anything when no one else is there. The rooms are fine and if I paid less, I wouldn't really complain, but again, for the price and the star rating, I expect more. There was no safe in the room, but otherwise the basics were there. Sheraton beds are always comfortable and this one was. The bathroom is really old and while I'm fine maintaining some of the historic personality, each room I've stayed at in the hotel has had similar variations of awkward layouts. The door was so heavy and squeaked loudly, the shower curtain was awful -- it would blow in and stick to you and keeping the door open or closed would not help. The shower was in a corner of the bathroom so with the shower curtain closed, there was barely any light in there. There is practically no counter space and I found myself keeping things on the floor. One of the most disappointing things about the room was the paper-thin walls. I went to bed around midnight on the first night only to be woken up around 2am with seemingly 6 or so people piled into the room next to me and continued to laugh, shout, etc. I was about to call downstairs to complain (which would have required getting out of bed as the phone is not on the bedside table) when I eventually fell back asleep. But it wasn't just party noise, the same group crammed in the room again about 5pm on Saturday when my husband and I were napping and even though they weren't partying, their voices, while not overly loud, were impossible to ignore. The thing that bothered me most was that when I got checked into the hotel at 11:45pm and called down for room service, I was told that the kitchen was closed. This is clearly labeled on their menus, but what I don't understand is how a supposedly 5-star hotel in a major city could not serve food at this time. I wouldn't always expect food at 3 or 4am, but 11:45 seems very reasonable to be able to call down for a sandwich. After working late and catching up with some colleagues at the pub before coming to the hotel, I was left eating a can of pringles for dinner.

The rooms we were in had been remodeled and were quite nice. Very comfortable sheraton sweet sleeper bed . Best one we had in europe. AC worked great and was quiet. Best thing is they added a third window for sound isolation to the noisy street so you barely hear any street noise.

The only things I could be negative about were that there was no \"English Breakfast\" tea in the room which I thought strange as we were in England - however a quick word to Guest Services had this fixed and our room wasn't ready on arrival, however, we did get in at 8am. The staff were excellent and so was the service during our stay. This even extended to our trip by cab to the airport, when we discovered (at the airport) one of our bags wasn't in the cab, the Sheraton had already put it in another cab (at their expense) and it turned up minutes later - good work guys!!!

Booked the accommodation using Starwood points. First, I agree with other contributors who reviewed this hotel that the location of this hotel is the major selling point. It's about 2 - 3 blocks away from the Green Park Tube underground station. It's a 10 minute stroll across Green Park to Buckingham Palace. There is a PRET and Starbucks about 3 - 4 blocks away from the hotel for basic breakfast and lunch, and a cafe called Henry's (http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/clubs_bars/review-515.php) also about 3 - 4 blocks away that serves a delicious breakfast at a pretty reasonable price. The hotel also has a few restaurants that serve breakfast. I tried the Citrus (http://citrusrestaurant.co.uk/). The food was good, but a bit more pricey. There's also a Marks & Spencer's Simple Food (http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/directory/1160/21715.php) about 4 -5 blocks away also. It's above the Green Park Tube underground station. Finally, it's also about a 20 minute walk along Piccadilly to Piccadilly Circus where you can catch a play in the neighborhood theater. Room decor / size could be better. My friend and I were originally placed in a Classic room with two single beds on the fourth floor (436). The room was very small, with very little room to maneuver. For the very first time, I ended up calling the front desk within minutes to see if we can get a larger room. The Executive rooms were not available, but the front desk asked that I inquire the next morning to see if there are any larger room. The next morning, I was able to secure a larger room on the 6th Floor (one of the Starwood Preferred Guests floor). The room was still small compared to rooms in the U.S.A., but definitely more room than the Classic room. One thing we noticed is that there are no coffee makers in the rooms (Classic and this larger one). The bathrooms in both these rooms are also very narrow. The decor of the rooms definitely need an update. Room service was also not as satisfactory compared to other hotels I've stayed at. One of the evenings, I ordered two scoops of strawberry and one scoop of vanilla ice-cream. What came was two scoops of vanilla and one scoop of strawberry ice-cream. i also ordered a bottle of Evian water. Instead, at first the room service staff forgot my bottle of water and had to go back to get it. He then brought back a bottle of water from Scotland. When I questioned about the Evian water (which was what was listed in the room service menu), he just said they didn't have it. Also, we had another situation where we couldn't figure out how come there was no air conditioning in the larger room on the 6th floor. This was the same night as the room service The Guest Service department said they would send an engineer over to check. Well, we waited and no one showed up. We decided not to press any further since the room got less warm / stuffy after we opened the windows. Well, the next day was much warmer and we had to call the engineer again. This time someone did show up and explained that the air conditioning for the entire hotel was shut off on the prior days because there were complaints from some guests about it being cold. Maybe my friend and I misunderstood him, but we found the explanation quite strange. While the room service was not as acceptable, the staff at the front desk were pretty nice and helpful.

The carpet was so dirrty, it was beyond cleaning. They would have been better-off just throwing out half of the junk furniture and leaving some space to move in the room. Perhaps they just left it in there in the hope of hiding the carpet. There were two plus-points though: the bed itself was clean and comfortable and the room was quiet. I should not have been surprised. The Sheraton is probably not the only hotel in a prime location that gets away with appalling quality. I do not doubt they will continue to do so. At \u00a3220 per night, I would much rather stay at one of the cheaper-but-cleaner chains and take my better half out for an expensive meal with the money saved!", "Date": "May 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Galway", "Title": "\u201cNot a 5 star hotel by any stretch of imagination\u201d", "Author": "ConemaraHolly", "ReviewID": "UR29364196", "Content": "After booking through Ian in Justonehotel.com (very helpful) after paying over \u00a3200 per night for the may 2010 bank holiday weekend I was expecting a luxury 5 star hotel. I need not have been as this place is no where 5 star standard. Very very delapidated throughout. Its a joke having to carry your luggage through the bar (up/down various steps) all the way to the rear of the hotel where the reception is! Though we found out later there is a an entrance to the rear it is only suited to those arriving by car not on foot... But this really wasnt the end of the world I guess. Our room was one of the smallest I've stayed in (room 216) and the smell of fresh paint very overpowering. The bed was superb - one of the comfiest I've stayed in. The view was awful... The sky not visible from the room, all that is visable is the adjacent building and dozens of vents about 10 feet away. You could not open the window as both the noise of the vents and the smell from them was like that of a landfil. Unbarable. The bathroom was very poor. Overall the room was very depressing and certainly encouraged us to see as much of London as possible and avoid time spent in the \"cell\". On Saturday morning 2nd May while waiting for the lift near our room, I politely asked a porter who was passing by in the corridor if it would be easy to hail a taxy outside ourselves or would I be better off phoning for one?? - I was amazed by his response - He simple shrugged his shoulders without making eye contact and kept walking mumbling \"I dont know...\" I said excuse me??? But he completly ignored us and kept walking!!! My fiance who was with me pleaded with me not to make a 'scene' by calling a manager so we let it go! The rest of the staff were very polite and helpful. Anyway overall the location is very good only 9 or 10 mins walk to Picadilly Circus and loads of nice resteraunts nearby. If they spent some dosh ( a lot of dosh) doing the place up throughout restoring it to its original elegance and you booked a park view room and did not encounter certain rude porters I reckon the hotel would be very good.

We arrived at 2:30pm. We took the tube from Heathrow airport and arrived hoping to get straight into a room. Check in time is 3pm but we didn\u2019t get into our room until 4pm. We did receive an upgraded room, but that was because we are Platinum Sheraton members. We were given one round of free drinks at the Palm Court bar, but that really doesn\u2019t make up for a 90 minute delay. The lobby is small and there are very few places to sit (while waiting for family members to check in). When entering the hotel from the Park side (which absolutely feels like the most used and recognizable side) you have to drag your bags through the Palm Court restaurant. There are NO ramps into and out of the sunken restaurant/lounge, so you end up dragging bags DOWN then UP stairs all the while passing people having afternoon tea. It is such a bizarre set up. There are NO bellmen to meet you at the entrance. I thought we must have missed a sign or just been unusual in our choice of entrance. While staying at the hotel for 36 hours, I saw numerous others have to deal with the same awkward situation. Also, who wants to have afternoon tea with weary travelers lugging their bags through the tea room? The room: The room had a single queen size bed (very comfy!). Our third adult had to sleep on a sleeper sofa (you could feel the bars through it). Our room was clean and had probably been redone recently (compared to the other reviews on this site, we must have gotten a new room). Our room was on the 7th floor and faced the park, the eye, Big Ben, etc\u2026 It was a spectacular view. The room was classified as a suite, but it had NO tea/coffee making services. We had to call down to get a tea making service (2 pound delivery charge). Be careful\u2026 the shower is SUPER slippery and the tub has very high sides (hard to get in/out of). Transportation to hotel: If you are coming from Heathrow, do not waste your money on the Heathrow express! The underground (on the Piccadilly line) takes you directly from Heathrow to the Green Park exit (just a 5 min walk to the hotel). If you take the Heathrow express, then you move fast and have fewer stops BUT you have to change trains! So, don\u2019t take it. Just take the tube. It\u2019s about 4 pounds per person for a single. When you are moving about the city, purchase a day pass (about 7 pounds) and you can use the tube all day. You can also purchase a 24 hour pass onto the tour bus (there are a few different ones). You can hop on and off as much as you want throughout the day. The tour buses stop at most of the major attractions. You can easily walk to Buckingham Palace from the hotel (changing of the guard every other day). You can also easily walk to the Marble Arch. Everything else is easily accessible by tube or bus. This hotel is expertly located in the city, but it does NOT feel like a 5 star hotel. It feels like an old hotel with a great location. Check in wasn\u2019t impressive but the concierge was excellent. He always greeted me with a smile (even the 6 times I bugged him during our 90 minute wait for a room).

We were given a standard room which would be considered large to any standard anywhere in Europe, so very big to London standards, yet I must say as we entered the room, our first feeling was that this was probably the \u00ab limit of shabby \u00bb we were prepared to accept. Bathroom definitely needs some serious lifting. All the fittings are old but luckily of excellent quality. Toiletries are quite austerous (not that it is amongst our priorities but more indulgent ones might make up a little for the worn joineries). As for the bedroom, replacing the rather worn carpet by some more durable, more hygienic wooden floor might be an option (I must stress that insonorisation seems quite efficient)\u2026. as well as rethinking the painting on the walls. No choice of pillows but perfect mattresses and excellent linen. That is for the standard bedroom\u2026 because otherwise the hotel is really nice all the way to the bedroom door. It has that Old World feel that we tend to get back to after two decades of minimalism. That was our very first impression\u2026. However after three days and from the warm smile at the reception desk to the wave of the doorman as we departed (staff is extremely helpful and eager to please !), from the fresh orange juice at breakfast to the relaxing tea in the lobby or great late night cocktail, from easy strolls in the park opposite the street to great museum and shopping sprees all within walking distance, we had been converted -and decided we might probably not consider any other place in London, \u2026no matter the bathrooms. We actually decided to go back next autumn\u2026 our choice, this time, being based on more than just sentimental reasons. Oh\u2026.

I have to stay we were not disappointed we had a spacious room on the 8th floor a very large bed and a sofa bed for the kids- although was a bit rickety - housekeeping made up nicely when requested. The room was plain and simple in decoration- not tired looking, and bathroom clean and modernised. There were no tea/coffee facilities and only 1 small bottle of complimentary water. The kids had room service meals -cheaper childrens options are provided- which were actually more adut size portions- we found this was efficient and meals of good standard. Most impressive was the babysitter provided who the kids loved.

I spent more time trying to decide on where to stay in London than the rest of our trip combined. For starters, if you take the Tube, you are going to have to walk quite a bit with your luggage to the hotel. And remember, the lobby is at the back. We of course, were too tired and frustrated (all luggage was delayed an hour) to remember, so we had to drag our luggage up and down stairs and around quite a few corners. The gentleman working at the desk, Rajiv, was EXTREMELY helpful though. When I asked about an upgrade (even though this was a Priceline stay) he spent about 10 minutes looking for something and eventually settled on an Executive Room after night 1. We were never so happy to hear that after we saw our initial room. Gross is the single word I would use to describe it. The carpet, walls and baseboards were black from dirt and use. No AC. The bathroom was only wide enough for one person at a time. This was exactly what I feared about paying $400 a night through *wood. Luckily the next day our luggage was moved to an Executive Room, which was obviously refurbished more recently. The walls and floors were cleaner, but still not what I would call 3* here in the States, and the bathroom was updated. A better value for the Priceline price I paid ($200 a night), but if I went through *wood as was my initial intention, I would've shot somebody. My wife was never comfortable walking on the floor without her socks the entire stay. The concierge did recommend us a VERY good Indian restaurant past Piccadilly Circus and was helpful. Relatively, it is close to 2 different Tube stations, but the entrance off of the back alley is mind boggling. The noise from the lobby/bar IS a problem if you are on a floor lower than the 4th. Suffice it so say, next time I will be staying someplace else, since IMHO, *wood has nothing reasonable in the city. It being London, you really cannot complain since everything in the city is crazy expensive for us over here. The location was good walking distance to whatever we wanted and the 2 Tube stations was good for our longer jaunts.

You may feel like you are crashing a wedding party or corporate event, but don't let that bother you. Registration is at the rear of the building near the Brick Street entrance.

My rate was around US$300 per night. The comments many previous posters have written about the Park Lane are not far off from the mark. For the amount of money being charged for this hotel, I would have expected a little more. While my room did not have worn carpet, the furnishings were a bit old. And, as other posters have stated, the room was pretty small (and being a Starwood elite, I was apparently upgraded, too). I overlooked the backside of another wing of the hotel (make sure you close the drapes). The bathroom was outfitted in white and grey marble, and offers a reminder of traditional Britishness. The towel-warming rack wonderful. However, the toilet was a bit dirty (I don't even want to describe it). The hotel has this general old-ness feel to it. I can't quite describe what I mean by \"old-ness.\" It's not the upper crust, gilded age of Britain, but it's not decrepit either. It kind of reminds me of the old, Soviet Union tourist hotels from the 1980s. It has a generally worn, slightly neglected feeling to it. That being said, the location of the Park Lane is hard to beat. (If you read my other posts on tripadvisor, you'll quickly see that location is a huge selling point for me.) It's located across from Green Park and near Hyde Park. It's mid-way between the Green Park and Hyde Park Corner tube stations (each about a 5 to 10 minute walk away). It's a quick ride to Picadilly Circus, Westminster Station (for the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben), Waterloo Station (for the London Eye), and Knightsbridge (for Harrod's). Buckingham Palace is a 10 minute walk away, too. The Park Lane is located in the Mayfair area of London, which is a nicer area, and home to many of the foreign embassies. It also has lots of nice little hole-in-the wall pubs (that are not full of tourists). The bellmen and concierge were very helpful, and always offered a friendly greeting and great advice on sights and restaurants. As a note, if you're taking the Heathrow Express into Paddington, it's about a US$25 cab ride (including tip) to the Park Lane. So, if you have the cash to spend (and mind you, London is really, really expensive for Americans these days), and you want a good hotel in a good location, pick the Park Lane Hotel.

Obviously this isn't a five star hotel, and it should be classified as such. So the fact that people show up there expecting a five star experience immediately puts both parties in a bad place. What the Park Lane is is a very well located hotel, with good, reliable service and -- stated bluntly -- mediocre rooms. I am part of the Preferred Guest program so I obviously stay there to capitalize on rewards, however, I've also come to appreciate the old-world British appeal of the place as well. Many of the rooms could use a rehab, and the quality I get on a visit by visit basis is often frustratingly inconsistent. However, if you're willing to overlook a bit of a tatter or miscolor in the carpet, or some cracks in the bathroom tile, you'll find this gets outweighed by generally helpful and efficient staff, a very nice bar and bartenders and a proxmity to parks, picadilly, tubes etc etc. On many occasions, the staff have bent over backwards to help -- for instance giving me a tiny room of my own to wait in until my own room was ready, etc. I've never had anyone be anything but friendly, as a matter of fact. I'm always greeted courteously and professionally. It's one of the reasons I'm willing to overlook a few deficiencies. Hope this helps clarify a bit of the negatives I've read.

Only a 5 minute walk from the Green Park underground Tube station off of the Piccadilly line makes it easy to get to from Heathrow Airport since you don't have to change. Let me preface this review by saying that this hotel has managed to hit three of my pet peeves. If you don't care about these issues, this hotel can be OK, albeit not at a bargain basement price. You won't find me going back to this property. 1) As a Sheraton Platinum member, there is no executive lounge, and no complementary breakfast for Platinum members. 2) They have one of the most expensive phone charges for dialing the local U.K. toll free numbers -- 0800 xxxxx. I made two \"toll free\" 0800 calls and spent \u20a416 or about $32 US Dollars. It could have been much worse! 3) When I complained, the staff really didn't care, and when I mentioned that I would never stay at this property again, they said, \"I am sorry to hear that\". My sense was that it really didn't matter to them. The hotel is fairly typical of an older property. It is 8 stories high, and my room was fairly large. The shower and bath were probably updated a while ago -- but it was very functional. In addition, the window in the main bedroom opened to the outside (a plus for cool fresh air) and there were double windows to reduce the outside noise (another plus). The heating/cooling controls did not work, thus the value of having windows that open. Location wise, this is a high tourist area and it is next to the Hard Rock Cafe. Many tourist attractions are nearby and the location of the tube is only 5 minutes away. Right next to the Sheraton is another local hotel and just around the corner is the Hilton and Four Seasons. As I travel quite a bit, I do use the local 0800 numbers. I am used to paying about \u20a41 to \u20a42 for an access charge. This I find to be \"normal\" and typical. This property charges you per minute to access the 0800 toll free numbers, with a \"cap\" per call of \u20a410. So if you are going to use the phone for five or six calls, you can literally spend \u20a450 or $100 dollars. As it turned out, I spent \u20a416 or $32, which I find ....well outside the realm of reasonable. The bigger issue is that when I complained, the desk really did not care. When I said that I was platinum, and that I wouldn't stay at this property again due to this, they didn't care. At the end of the day, charging a huge phone bill on top of a \u20a4200 room, and then not caring when your customers are unhappy makes it so that I cannot recommend this property to others -- if you care about these issues.

We have been here a few times and have stayed in a number of rooms, some better than others. Our visits have been using Starwood points or paid for by my husband's employer; this is not a property I would spend my own money on. In London there are better options in the same price range. On our most recent stay the room was ordinary, with no view - an older motel style room in atmosphere. (This was a points stay). However, it did have the comfortable Sheraton beds. The safe did not work, and after we complained they gave us a complimentary breakfast, which was nice. We have had better rooms here, however, even overlooking Green Park, and even when using Starwood points. We also have had worse rooms. On one notable occasion our original suite was very hot and stuffy due to an unaccustomed London heatwave, the airconditioning was not working, so we were moved very late at night to a room way up high in the hotel (maybe where the maids used to live) which was less than mediocre indeed , but all they had available for that night. Even the room we eventually ended up in that time was hot, although the A/C worked; it was so hot that they had to bring in a fan as well. This is probably not a hotel to stay in if it is summer, as it will be very uncomfortable. We've had breakfast a few times here, it is expensive and done better elsewhere. Likewise drinks and coffee in the Palm Court lounge. (For a cheaper breakfast option you can get carryout coffee and croissants from a number of places nearby.) However, both the Palm Court lounge and the beautiful art deco Silver Ballroom are definitely worth looking at; they have been in several movies and TV shows. Location is excellent, Green Park tube is close, and the interesting Shepherds Market area has lots of restaurants. We like El Pirata tapas restaurant, just round the corner, and Sofra for Middle Eastern food, a bit further away.

As I was on business, the convenient location made it a worthwhile experiment. Unfortunately, the staff and aging facilities helped insure I will not return. The problems began at check-in, early on a Monday morning, when I was straight off a flight from Heathrow. The check-in attendant wore a badge identifying her as a trainee and insisted policy required a GBP 100 charge for an early check-in. There was no one else behind the desk at approximately 7:30am to provide any helpful overruling of this policy, despite ample vacancies. Thereafter, I got a room that featured worn carpet and aging furniture with a bath that looked like it was renovated recently on the cheap. Although the bath looked somewhat new, it had plenty of cracks that marked shoddy construction. Plus, my room featured a portable air conditioning (it was an incredibly 20 degrees Celsius during my stay). I have seen this before in older European hotels, but the exhaust was pointed right back in the room, rather than out a window. Adding insult to injury was a lack of in-room Internet other than a very slow (and still quite expensive) wifi that required calling down to the front desk, after which they returned my call with a pass code. And most surprising, my room lacked a safe, which I consider to be a basic amenity for any hotel that largely attracts foreigners with passports to store. My second stay later in the week offered a room with internal air conditioning/heating and a safe (after a specific request). However, the hotel is clearly old and run down. The staff was polite on my second check-in, but slow and quite inefficient. Despite hundreds of rooms, the hotel seems to staff its front desk with only one person, who is also responsible for answering calls for any requests from people in the rooms. This overloading makes accomplishing basic tasks quite difficult (and was a reason I did not request a new room the first time around -- the line was too long to even make the request).

After I learned I was assigned this hotel, I was not too pleased after reading the reviews here. When I checked in, the bad reviews were confirmed. I was given an \"old\" room with shabby carpets, stuffy with a portable air conditioner, and a window that opened to a large roof-top A/C vent that was terribly noisy. The room was dark and was indeed old. I realized that I had been given one of the \"bad\" rooms described elsewhere here. I went to the desk to complain and request a new room. They were nearly sold out and was told that they had two available \"executive\" rooms but at a cost of an additional \u00a340 ($80 US). This was still a better deal than if I had booked directly with the hotel. The \"new\" room was great. It was large, had a separate bath and shower, a great bed, central air and heat, and everything was clean and new. A two-night stay here was very relaxing and well worth the money. From what I can gather, this hotel has two types of rooms: old/terrible and new/nice. I'm not sure if all of the new/nice rooms are called \"executive,\" but they probably are. Be sure that if you reserve directly with the hotel that you clarify that you are getting one of the newer rooms. If you use Priceline, I am quite sure you will be given an old room, so be prepared to pay extra to upgrade as the old rooms are definitely not 4-star quality. The hotel's dining options are very expensive. The bar serves a decent menu and mixes excellent drinks. But, a martini is \u00a311 ($22 US). I don't care how good the drinks are, they aren't worth that. This is certainly a 4 star hotel if you get a new room; a 2 star (if that) if you get an old room.

There are small issues that detract as well--beautiful marble bathroom that is very well laid out--but there is a heated towel rod that has been turned off and a phone jack with no phone. It is like the hotel is stepping backwards in terms of luxury. Absolutely huge walk in closets were a great surprise, and the King Bed was highly comfortable--good job. The air conditioning was central air and worked perfectly--but it was a suite. I cannot imagine what a standard room would look like. The morning breakfast was in Bracewells--a beautiful old room tha tlooks like lit was once a very elegant restaurant for formal meals. Anyhow--excellent breakfast, beautiful china and warm service. The Palm Court was a lovely place for tea with live harpist and good service. Watch the additional phone charges--a call through Canada Direct-- a free 1-800 service--resulted in a an over 9 pound charge to the room--and there was no willingness to remove the cost.

I have to agree with many of the other reviews that this hoel has great public spaces but the shabby bedooms need work. However, the hotel is convenient to tube and has 24 service which is great for business travellers. The front of the hotel faces Green Park but the proper hotel entrance is on the back . It is fine if you are coming by taxi as the drivers all know this, but if you are coming by Tube, you will end up carrying your luggage across a hall and through the tea room/restaurant and bar. And there are no porters to help until you get through the back of the hotel where the official entrance is located. I saw many tourists obviously stumbling off of overseas flights trying to figure out where to go! The desk staff have the typical bored nature of most hotel staff but the porters and concierge are helpful and pleasant. I was first given a room on the first floor but when I asked to change to a higher floor, they changed it to the third floor easily enough. I booked through Priceline so I wasn't given a preferred room on the Starwood floor that other reviewers have mentioned. The room was pretty shabby but clean except for the carpet. The paint was peeling and there were marks on the wall and the carpet was filthy contrasting with the hall carpet which was new and clean. The bathroom was shabby with cracked tiles, paint peeling, and just old. But it was clean and big enough and a huge tub. The saving grace was the bed was brand new, clean, and very comfortable. The bed was great. Obviously my room was once a large room that had been divided into two tiny ones. European hotel rooms are always small so it didn't really bother me but there was too much furniture in the room for that size. The desk table was pushed perpendicular against another console so it couldn't be used--and the computer plug and light didn't work--and the desk chair rubbed shoulders with the room's easychair that was right next to a wall. Consequently, I couldn't get to or use the room's mirror over the console table to use the hairdryer. And like most English hotels, there wasn't a bathroom outlet. The closet was huge and I think they should have placed the dresser --a tiny Ikea cheap thing--inside for more room. The tv was tiny with poor reception but I wasn't in the room enough to watch. I was fortunate to not have one of the portable airconditioners that were evident in other rooms--I could see the tubes snaking out the windows, and since it was cool, I didn't need to run it which is fortunate since it seems very noisy and old. If it was hot outside, I could see how this would be a problem. The location was good. The hotel just down the street from the Green Park stop which is convenient to two lines and also near an M&S Simpley Food (which remarkably was open late for London--until at least 8:30 pm), a Boots chemist, and Starbucks which was convenient for quick food and necessities. The hotel was located down from Picadilly--a bit of a walk but certainly easy. As a female travelling alone, I found the street a bit too quiet for my taste while walking back alone after 9 pm (Park on one side and empty offices surrounding the hotel) and it felt a little sketchy. Would I stay here again? If I had to I would be fine--it is easy, but the shabby rooms seem to outnumber the ones that are for Starwood preferred guests with lots of points so it seems to be a matter of luck if you get a refurbished room.", "Date": "August 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, but really needs refurbishing\u201d", "Author": "FromNorthJersey", "ReviewID": "UR8352843", "Content": "I have stayed twice here over the last 15 months, for a combined 10 days.

Instead to my utter dismay I found myself into a casual dining area where people were having drinks and eats, some of them stared at me while I was struggling with a suitcase, laptop and a hand bag. After sometime a hotel staff came forward and guided me to the reception at the back of the ground floor. I then discovered that the main entrance was in a small lane off the main road where there was no arrow or sign showing the right way. I booked an executive room with high expectations. But, I was allotted a room without a view and very stuffy. When asked for a change I was refused. Afterwards I spoke to the Duty Manager and insisted in a change of room as I found it to be absolutely suffocating. Hence, it would not be possible to spend two full days and night there. Anyway, after much insistence he obliged and allocated a better room with good view. However, I found hotel staff in every area were quite stiff and unfriendly. The hotel was not of Sheraton class or standard and appeared highly neglected. The front entrance area leading to the dining hall stinks.

All beds (including the cot) were made up in the Sheraton \"sweet sleeper\" style and we were very comfortable. The room had the usual high-end amenities: TV, AC, phone, Mini-bar, hairdryer, and shampoos, lotion, etc. Our room didn't have a view of anything other than the side of another building, but since I had selected one of the lower rates offerred by the hotel, I was not expecting a view. The room was fairly large and very quiet (never heard any neighbors). The bathroom was long and narrow with a full tub, but it was covered in marble and just lovely (very clean as well). I noticed the prior reviews of smells and such, we didn't encounter anything negative here, smells or otherwise. It is an old hotel, but I agree that I would have been unhappy if I had had the same issues on my stay. I have never had these problems at the Park Lane; my experiences at this hotel, for the past 8 years or so, have always been postiive like this one. We didn't eat at the hotel, as the restaurant is pretty pricey, but for breakfast on the first day, we went to \"Pret a Manger\" (about 2 blocks away on Picadilly) and picked up croissants, pastries and drinks. The second morning, we went to a little grocery store by Marks & Spencer (about 2-3 short blocks away on Picadilly) for fresh fruit, croissants, yogurt drinks and then to Starbucks for coffee. Both much less expensive options than breakfast at the hotel, and a better fit for what my kids wanted to eat. The staff were very kind, gracious and accomodating; the housekeeping staff were very efficient. I have stayed at the Park Lane over the years many times, always picking one of the least expensive rooms offered, and I would definitely stay there again. The location cannot be beat. It is a few blocks from the Green Park tube, a few blocks to Hyde Park, a couple tube stops to Knightsbridge (Harrods, etc) and Sloane Square. In the past I have stayed at the Park Lane alone and I found the area quite safe for a woman alone. Not far away is shopping, Leicester square (half-off tickets for theater) and loads of great restaurants and pubs. This isn't a budget traveler's hotel, as the tax brought my rate closer to 190 pounds (about $350), but it is a reliable, safe, pleasant and very comfortable place to stay. I would definintely recommend the Park Lane Sheraton.", "Date": "July 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cdon't understand all the complaining\u201d", "Author": "sirtravel", "ReviewID": "UR5437657", "Content": "I stayed at the Sheraton Park Lane with my wife and 8 year old daughter in one room and my in-laws had a junior suite.

Unfortunately, I was given a smallish room with a queen bed and since the hotel was fully booked they could not change our room that night. They were quick to accomodate us by putting a cot in the room for the first night and then moving us to a nice executive room with king size bed the next night. It probably helped that I was a gold-level frequent traveler of this hotel chain, but I found them very accomodating. The rooms and lobby were immaculately clean and there were no odors as suggested by earlier reviewers. This hotel is a grand old dame and you have to expect some difficulties with hotels of this age, but in general I found the hotel and service very good. I was also pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, especially the Citrus Restaurant. And if you want to avoid a VERY expensive breakfast, there is a great coffee shop attached to the hotel serving top quality coffee + cappucino and baked goods. The location is perfect with Green Park sprawled out across the street and a 200 meter walk to Buckingham Palace. In addition, the cozy Shepards Market area is tucked in behind the hotel with GREAT bars and restaurants. The Spanish tapas restaurant around the corner in the back of the hotel is good and reasonable (especially for Mayfair). The only thing one could quibble about is the cost. At $350-400 per room it is a bit pricey, but again it is London. If you are on a budget this is not for you. But if you want convenience and comfort I found the hotel very acceptable.

I booked through British Airways, since I flew with them from the USA, and they had what I knew to be a good discount price. I had already compared prices by looking online through Starwood/Sheraton website, and by calling to the hotel directly on the phone and consulting the Guide Michelin. I got a free night (special deal) and a generally reduced rate overall. I also made sure to join the Starwood Preferred Guest program (free). Now, let's go over why there is/was a discount, what I got for the $$$$, and some other facts. Prior reviews have noted the inconveninet back street reception entrance on Brick Street, and the even worse idea of arriving at the Piccadilly entrance and having to drag your bags through the Palm Court to the rear of the hotel and up and down two small flights of stairs and through 3 sets of doors to reach the lifts. But, if you have read the reviews here and done your research as you should..you should know about the layout and be easily able to avoid it. The taxi drivers (all) knew about this entrance problem and they do NOT drop you at the Piccadilly entrance unless you insist. Do NOT arrive via the Underground at Green Park, as you must walk approximately 4 blocks and then negotiate the (narrow) Brick Street to reach the reception entrance. Arrive via Taxi, and best to use the Heathrow Express from the airport to Paddington Station. Much more convenient to use than the Tube. As to the room, the discount I got reflected some deterioration in the room condition. I had a \"preferred room\" , at least I was TOLD so... However, the room did have a large crack in the ceiling plaster, and some peeling and cracked paint in two relatively small locations in the bathroom, in the spots where you would expect paint to crack first in any bathroom. There were also 3 extensively cracked faux marble floor tiles in the bathroom with one small piece missing in one spot. All the appliances and etc worked and were in good order, though the provided hair dryer located on the bathroom wall seemed to be an antique type that was not very effective. Another, hand-held, more modern type hair dryer was in the closet however, if you preferred to use that. The bed was very comfortable. The heat worked well and never experienced any cold. The doors of the other rooms do close loudly, as other reviews have said. But, they are old style, heavy wooden things and if the other guests just were to CLOSE them, rather than SLAM them..it would not be a real problem. The hotel is remodeling NOW. I could see the work going on in other rooms. So, it seems the peeling paint problems and tiles may soon be fixed. There was no view from this room. It looked onto a fire escape. It was not the largest room, nor the smallest, room on the floor. I read the \"fire plan layout\" on the room door to learn this. the hotel location is excellent, and very convenient to manay things/places. But it is an older hotel that needs manitenance in the rooms and the lifts. These problems can be corrected fairly easily and SOME are being done now. Is it 5 stars? No...its a 3 now...but it could be a 4 soon. Actually, if you paid more than I did for an Executive Room or a Suite you'd likely say it was a 4 star now.

I may be American but I try not to draw attention to that fact, and the hotel's layout, with the concierge at the back side of the hotel was no help. Once you are familiar with the hotel and know the back street entrance, obviously, you can avoid this scenario, but it is annoying to have to make that accomodation. If you are on the upper floors you might have a great view of Green Park. Unfortunately, the room I stayed in faced into an interior courtyard, courtyard being a generous word for more bizarre design.

The room was by no means awful, but it was definitely not worth making a pilgrimage for.

Reasonable size room, okay decor, as throughout the hotel, which gets away from the standard international hotel 'how many fabrics can we place in one room?' school of interior design. Think of it as 'period' rather than 'shabby' or 'in need of a make-over'. Great bathroom (marble-lined) with lots of hot water and (thank heavens) a separate shower cubicle rather than the usual shower-in-the-bath. Lousy reception on every TV channel, and last week's 'Time Out' doesn't over-inspire confidence, but lots of towel, toiletries and hot water, and the bed has to be one of teh most comfortable I've slept in.... WiFi Internet access at extra cost via T-Mobile (standard T-Mobile rates), a change from other Sheratons I've stayed in where access comes free, in a hotel where the extras add up (\u00a33 for a mineral water that costs 50p in the nearby Marks and Spencer?). A great breakfast (the low-carb) at extra cost, even if the coffee pots don't keep the coffee hot for long, a small gym (cycles, treads and a couple of weights machines) helps work off even more pounds. Comfortable lounge areas add to the ambience, and you can't but feel a thrill when walking off Piccadilly into the Palm Court (taxis drop you round the less conspicuous back), but it's just that little bet less good than you want it to be: there's a habit of leaving odd pieces of crockery in the corridors which is particularly annoying (especially when the neighbours bring in Big Macs and a trolley-load of smelly wrappings stays outside their room for the best part of a day).", "Date": "August 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cso so\u201d", "Author": "hrpj", "ReviewID": "UR3699398", "Content": "The Park Lane Hotel clearly has seen better days, and we found it somewhat tired and in need of a refurbishment. On the plus side, the location is very central, and convenient for Buckingham Palace, the Victoria & Albert and Natural History Museums, and Knightsbridge. The building has a good deal of character, particularly the lounge area, featuring huge comfortable sofas, and beautiful stained glass windows. Unfortunately, someone has taken their eye of the ball in looking after the hotel. The entrance foyer features some bizarre historical costumes, and outdated luxury goods mounted in display cases. I've never seen this in a hotel before, and as a first impression it makes you feel as if you're on a trip to Madame Tussaudes! The Reception is hidden away and somewhat hard to reach. Our room was quite small, and marred by an enormous mobile air conditioning unit which had been jammed in next to the bed, with a bulky hose venting air out of the open window. The weekend we went was very hot, however having this in the room seemed really out of place and took away from the ambience of the room. Needless to say it stopped working in the evening, and despite a lot of fiddling with the buttons we failed to breathe life into it. I think we should have complained really, but we couldn't be bothered. We also noticed a foldaway bed pushed up against a corridor wall that stayed there for two days running. This just reinforced the impression that a lack of care was being shown in running the hotel. On returning from a meal out on Saturday night, we relaxed with a cup of tea in the lounge. The tea service was superb, with silver plated utensils and ample quantities of red hot tea. We were very impressed with the antique silver strainer which was good fun! The service was also faultless. However, the ambience was marred by the house music that they were playing. It jarred against the setting, was too loud and too fast, and wholly inappropriate for such an austere old-fashioned hotel. I actually liked the music that they were playing, but some slow relaxed songs on a piano would have set the tone so much better. To sum up, this hotel has got the raw ingredients to be a landmark hotel, but at present, has clearly seen better days. It really needs a sympathetic refurbishment and a complete makeover to recapture it's past success.", "Date": "July 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tervuren, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cNot too bad\u201d", "Author": "bontheka", "ReviewID": "UR3682651", "Content": "Husband, 9 month old son and I had a ceremony to attend at Buckingham Palace and hubby gave me the task of booking a hotel.

Initially, I booked the Cavendish St James Hotel when I got a very good rate through precisionreservations website but a few days later I was informed that the room was not available. At the last minute (the day before checking in), I booked a room at a 'secret hotel' through lastminute.com. It wasn't really a secret as I did a google search based on the hotel description and location and knew it was the Park Lane. Although the reviews were so-so, I decided to go for this hotel because of the location. Following the London bombings, we decided to use as little of the tube as possible and we did walk everywhere in the end. We stayed for 2 nights - 12th and 13th July. Check-in was smooth and relatively quick. The room itself - a standard double which I got for \u00a399 a night, looked classy but small. Basically a double bed with bedside table on either side, an armchair, a writing desk with chair. There was also a little portable A/C with a big hose hanging out the window. My husband said it was to suck the hot air out of the room. I switched that off before going to bed as I wanted to close the window to keep out the traffic noise. There was also proper A/C which kept the room at just the right temperature. I loved the closet. It was one you could walk into, had some shelves with a mini safe, and hangers to hang your clothes. There were also bathrobes. The bathroom was small but had a bathtub with a shower hose, toilet which hadn't been flushed properly, a sink with mirror, and a small magnifiying mirror. We didn't dine in the hotel. The nice lounge which we had to walk through to get to the main street (opp. Green Park) did smell of cigar.

The manager was nice about it, gave us complimentary bottle of champagne for our trouble and the air worked the first night but then not the next two and it was very hot indeed.

I wouldn't stay there again unless I had a very good deal. Be careful on the free night.

This hotel is in a great location and has beautiful common/public areas, but the rooms are HUGELY disappointing. First, they put me in a \"suite\" because I am platinum. Evidentally, they think bigger is better. The entire hotel needs a new HVAC system because it smells musty and moldy... which is terrible for me because I have allergies and asthma. Anyway the suite had nice square footage, but was in dreadful condition... wallpaper peeling off, paint chipped off on all the doorways, A/C in the living area was broken (they brought-up a fan, the bedding I swear was from 1984...dusty drapes, dusty, dirty! The whole room seemed dirty. I didn't sleep a wink. The next night (after begging for something which didn't smell musty!) they moved me to an \"Executive\" room which they claim had been renovated. Turns out, it still smelled bad and and had the same old dirty bedding and curtains, but the furntiture was newer. I guess renovation means newer furniture! I left after three nights with almost a full-blown cold...sneezing, coughing etc. Now, I am happily at another hotel. To me if you are on business in London, you want a decent place to be in the evenings and you need GOOD sleep! This place is old and dirty. I have one word for them ... RENOVATE!!!

First of all, the hotel is in a great location if you are there to sightsee. It is within very close walking distance from Hyde Park, Green Park, Buckingham Palace, and the Westminster (Big Ben) area. There is also a tube stop (Green Park) a few blocks away so getting to areas such as the Tower of London, Notting Hill, or Kensington is not a problem at all. Frankly, that is the most important to me, since I was not there to hang out in the hotel bar and spend hours upon hours in my room. Secondly, the staff is overall very friendly, especially the concierge and the bellhops. They knew the city well and were able to provide good recommendations and advice. The hotel inside is attractive, but didn't seem to be very busy. The lobby is somewhat smoky (to be expected in Europe I suppose), but seems to be popular for afternoon tea (albeit very pricey, especially for those spending the equivalent of American dollars). Our room was good, nothing spectacular, it was a bit stuffy, but that was easily solved by opening a window, it was small by American standards, but as long as I can sleep there and open my suitcase, who cares how big the room is? I didn't see any peeling paint, our furniture seemed good enough.

It was dark, it smelled musty, the carpet looked old and dirty, and the furniture reminded me of the Fayetteville, NC Four Points Hotel in which I stayed 3 years ago. The bathroom was a joke. The paint around the pipes was peeling off. There was nowhere to put anything and there was nowhere to hang towels by the single sink. The shower had good water pressure, but the water temperature kept fluctuating (picture scalding hot water whenever someone flushed the toilet). The room had a relatively large closet - too bad we couldn't see anything inside it because the light was so dim. There were dead flies in the ceiling light, and live ones flying around the room waiting to join them. The only good things about the room were the towels and bedding. The sheets were obviously very high quality sheets, the blanket was 100% wool, and the pillows were soft down-filled and huge. Too bad the bed was as hard as a door, and our \"double\" bed consisted of two twin beds pushed together and covered with a sheet. The join of the two mattresses made it feel like we were sleeping on a pull out sofa bed.
