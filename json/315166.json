On arrival, we were kept waiting at Reception whilst the receptionist sorted out our keys for three rooms for 3 nights. For some reason, this took a long time! My fianc\u00e9 and I were eventually allocated a room on the ground floor; it would seem we drew a short straw here as our room smelt like a drain and was quite small, even for a Parisien hotel. It was a disabled access room, so the shower room was enormous...puzzlingly, the door wasn't very wide nor did it seem to open far enough to accommodate a wheelchair. Curious, like the smell. There's no air-con but the windows opened (onto the terrace) but our room stayed quite cool. Our room was reasonably clean; however, upstairs in my sister's room it was a different story as she discovered some white crusty stains on the carpet and coverlet. The breakfast was disappointing - very basic continental (packet ham, cheese, yoghurt, coffee, croissant) offering with the cheapest brands of everything and it all ran out very quickly & wasn't replaced with any alarcity. We enjoyed pretty good nights' sleep despite being on the ground floor. My poor aged father did not as on the second night his neighbour's door had to be taken down, and the receptionist was incredibly unhelpful when he reported this. \"It's not our fault\". The hotel is about a 15 min walk from Denfert or Glaci\u00e9re; there are a couple of nice brasseries on the Boulevard Arago and it's handy for town. I wouldn't say it is central or nice enough to command its price tag with the Euro/GBP being what it is at the mo'; you would find a better deal closer to town, I think.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cVery nice stay\u201d", "Author": "SteveNM", "ReviewID": "UR111522822", "Content": "Arrived 5/26/2011 from Baltimore via London to CDG Airport. It was pretty easy getting into Paris. The passport review was quick and simple \u2013 they also speak English. At the terminal I was able to locate the signs for the RER B train into town. This is one of several options for getting into the city. For me it was economical, easy, and had a metro stop close to my hotel. There are plenty of signs that lead you to RER B \u2013 follow the signs and you will eventually get to the ticket seller. They also speak English. Get the roundtrip RER ticket (good for use at any time) if you plan to come back to this airport. The ticket will also get you through the metro if you need to use both \u2013 I did. I also bought a \u201cbook\u201d of 10 metro tickets. I like to walk, but it is always handy to have metro access, especially when you\u2019ve been doing too much walking for a day. All transactions went very smoothly using major credit card. I went to the #12 platform and the train was already there waiting. In less than a couple of minutes I was headed into town (I had two pieces of luggage \u2013 one large enough to stow in overhead, and a small backpack) \u2013 since I arrived during a busy time, it was kind of awkward maneuvering the luggage to keep it out of the way as people got on and off \u2013 mind you the train got packed, and this was about 6:30-7:30 pm, so be forewarned especially if you have lots of baggage. The 1st transfer stop went smoothly. I had to maneuver luggage using stairs, so be aware. Metro entrance was easy to find, using RER ticket I went through no problem and found appropriate car. I used Google maps to get directions from the metro stop to the hotel. When I arrived at my stop (used stairs again), the map helped me find the hotel very easily. Getting there from the metro stop went without a hitch. There are three stops near this hotel \u2013 Gobelins, Glaciers, and Corvisart. I found the Gobelins closest and easiest. Arrived at hotel and was greeted by friendly staff. I used a major credit card (after having reserved on line), and had no problems. I was given key to my room and went up to call it a night. The room is a single room with a bathroom. I have a single bed, a large storage space with cubbyholes and hanging closet and a fold out for my luggage \u2013 lots of storage. The bathroom was clean and just big enough. Although there is no air conditioning, I opened the window and the room cooled down right away. The days got hotter as time went by, but did not need a fan so far \u2013 especially at night. Breakfast is included in the cost of the hotel for Saturday and Sunday stays only. If you want it during the week, the cost is extra. I would recommend getting the breakfast. There are a variety of drinks including juices, coffee, tea, milk, hot water, etc. You have croissants, bread (for toasting if you like), baguette (cheese and ham were available to make sandwich), jams, jelly, butter, etc.; variety of cereals; fruit cocktail and peach compote and applesauce and yogurt were also available. So it is pretty substantial. The best part is that you have access to wifi on the ground floor, and you can have breakfast and catch up on e-mail and surf while having that 2nd or 3rd cup of coffee in the dining room or on the patio. It\u2019s all you can eat, so it prepares you for the long day ahead of sightseeing, etc. Although wifi is available only on the ground floor, you can occasionally access it in your room (I was in 411), during off hours or when you get lucky. If you have problems, the staff is very helpful with getting you up and running. The staff varies throughout the day, and from day to day. All speak English and are very friendly and helpful. Rooms are turned over each day. The hotel has some wear and it shows on carpets, rugs, bedding, etc., but nothing to be alarmed about. It is quite comfortable. A bigger pillow would have been nice. The room is quiet but can be kind of noisy during the night \u2013 especially on weekends. My window faced the street entrance. If you close the window, it drowns out the noise some, but if this is something that affects your sleep, I would highly recommend earplugs. There is a TV in the room and a telephone (never used but wake up service is available). If you\u2019re coming from US, be sure to bring an electrical adapter. My room only had one outlet near my bed, so not a problem. I was able to recharge my laptop, camera batteries, etc., with no problems. There is an outlet in the bathroom for a hair dryer you can get from the hotel. Bring your own alarm clock too if you need one. There is an ironing room on the 6th floor, too. There are lots of facilities within walking distance: small markets, convenience stores, laundry, dry cleaning, and lots of places to get drinks, snacks and meals. A convenient market, bakery, and butcher (with roasted chicken and cold cuts) are just around the corner. Metro stops are very close and easy to use to get to major attractions. I like to walk a lot, so I used Google maps to get directions for walking to and from places no matter how close or far. I have an old Michelin Paris Plan (#11) that I bought for my trip here about 20 years ago. It is still accurate, and I used it quite a bit especially when I thought I was getting lost. Some kind of map is a must. The metro stations also provide Metro maps as well \u2013 learn how to use the system, it really is a timesaver. Really enjoyed my stay here and that was mostly due to the friendliness of the staff.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBusiness Trip\u201d", "Author": "perbinder", "ReviewID": "UR95313796", "Content": "Stayed 2 nights for a conference.

We stayed here for 5 nights in mid-September and once again in mid-Oct. as we were departing. We paid between 76 and 80 Euros per night, depending on the day of the week and how we booked it. Be sure breakfast is included when you book--sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. Look for a deal that includes it. Book well ahead as this hotel fills up fast. The rooms were plain and simple, but clean. A helpful staff member was always at the front desk to answer questions. We arrived at about 7 a.m. after having been on the airplane or in airports most of the day and night before our arrival. Even though check-in wasn't until 3 p.m., the desk clerk asked the housekeeper to clean a room for us and let us have it early. It was tucked away on the first floor and was extremely quiet as was the other room we had on a floor higher up. There are several metro stations nearby (Corvisart, Glaciere, and Gobelins) as well as a bus stop which will take you directly to a couple of the train stations -- much easier than lugging suitcases in the metro. The best part about this location is that it is near the Rue Moufletard--a shopping street full of small food shops and restaurants where our friends Marisa and Dominique do their grocery shopping. Meander down it to get to the Latin Quarter. The route will take you by the Pantheon and other old churches that merit exploring. One of my favorite finds on the Rue Moufletard was the \"Maison des Tartes\"--a little fixed price restaurant which features different types of quiches.

It is also near to 2 metro stops, one of which goes directly to the Louvre. It's about a 5 minute walk to either station. Neither walk at night is dangerous, since either way is well lit. Service: The only time we needed to make use of the hotel staff was in settling a difficulty with our reservation. We booked via Expedia, but with 2 separate reservations because the first one was with our air miles, and the 2nd one was paid, also booked via expedia. We mistakenly booked our 2nd reservation for the wrong day, and one concierge made it his business to make it as difficult as it could be for us. Attempted to charge us for anything he could think of. Fortunately the manager is much more forgiving, and the matter was settled quickly afterward without extra charge. That one concierge was the only bad one, the others were all very pleasant and spoke English well. The maids came daily and did a good job cleaning our room and even figured out on their own that we like to keep the windows open during the day (to avoid any musty smells). they were also pleasant. Rooms: We stayed in Room 306. It was about 7x10ft, with a very small bathroom about 4x5ft. We expected it to be small so we were ok. The room had a 13\" TV (that was suspended from the ceiling--saving precious floor space) that we never turned on so i can't comment on the quality of the picture or the channels they have. The room was clean, the carpet didn't have any stains on it, neither did the room smell. The room was simple, but appeared to be recently renovated with modern styling. The bed was decently firm, but felt mildly old (maybe 1-2yrs old?) because the center of the bed was concave. Still, it was supportive and i never had any difficulty having a good night sleep. It was roughly the size of an american full size. The bathroom was basic, with sink, toilet and shower stall. The water pressure was good, and the temperature was easy to control with no problems maintaining temperature. Make sure you bring outlet converters, because as expected, this hotel only had european plugs, 220v. It had 3 plugs, which was plenty for us. ***Be careful, for those of you staying during the summer, our room didn't have an A/C, neither do i think the other rooms. The weather was in the 70's, so heat wasn't an issue, but if it gets hot and humid...i'm not sure how it would be. Amenities: The room did not come with a hairdryer, iron or ironboard. I hear that some hotels you can ask for these at the desk. We didn't bother gambling on this and just brought our own things. Breakfast as served from 7-10am, and costs 7Euro per person. I never ate this so i can't comment. I heard that they serve crossaints and other breads, cheeses and juices. We ate from nearby Boulangeries instead, which also serve the same things, and was cheaper. There is a vending machine in the lobby in case you need something to snack on or drink in the middle of the night. Overall, this is a good value, for the price. it's not your romantic bed+breakfast or boutique hotel, it's not your ultra-posh hotel, nor does it pretend to be any of these.

I really don't want to sound as if I'm nagging but it was a terrible experience all around.", "Date": "October 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guernsey, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cParis in september\u201d", "Author": "Mark-Guilbert", "ReviewID": "UR10070424", "Content": "I booked this hotel as it was reasonably priced. The rooms were sufficient by french standards and the location wasn't ideal or so we thought . . . The metro is close by and is extemely efficient and cheap, just avoid the rush times. This allows you to access all of Paris quickly and easily. We far preferred to walk and if you headed north from the hotel towards the student areas (Rue Mouffetard) there were a large number of restaurants at very reasonble prices. Mme Nadine at the hotel speakes excellent english and is very, very helpful. We stayed six nights and it was excellent value for money. Our big moan about Paris in General was the amount of dog poo evreywhere - just watch your step.", "Date": "October 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cBest Deal In Paris\u201d", "Author": "Scourgey", "ReviewID": "UR8276534", "Content": "At first I was worried about booking this hotel since there were no reviews, but after a 14 day stay in Paris, I HIGHLY recommend this hotel. This is in conjunction with a conference. So I stayed at the Touring Magendie Hotel before and after my conference. The bottom line is this is like staying at a good quality Holiday Inn Express that has been renovated. Area: 13th Arrondistment near Les Goblins and Covisart Metro Stations. A very quiet authentic part of Paris. With very easy metro access to two different lines (7 and 4). Condition: Rooms a small but they are very well designed. Seems to be newly renovated, ask for rooms above the 1st and 2nd floor which are in almost new condition. Note-no air conditioning Guests: Mostly European tourists, some with families of two or three children and a few business travelers. Amenities: Breakfast is not included but for 6.80 Euros per day there is a decent continental breakfast with very good croissants (better than the ones at the Hilton Paris). TV with basic channels, phone, shampoo and soap. Concierge: Well the Manager Madame Nadine is usually there in the mornings and I found her to be very very helpful. Note: My shower was not being cleaned after two days and I tipped the cleaning staff and insisted that my shower is cleaned and the problem was corrected. Rely on Manager Madam Nadine's advice. For a coin laundry near the hotel: Take a left from the entrance, the take a left at the end of the street. Turn left onto Rue de Glacier and you will see a Lavanier Libre Service. As the front desk if you are not sure Wifi: Don't pay for the wifi at the hotel. If you are there during good weather. Walk on Rue de Covisart toward the Metro station of the same name. Along the way you will pass the Square Rene de Garre. Free Paris City Wifi is all around the park.", "Date": "August 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat little place!\u201d", "Author": "thanner", "ReviewID": "UR7615057", "Content": "There were 3 girls in this trip and we stayed at the Touring Hotel in late Feb. The hotel is easy to find, the directions given are hard to mess up. The hotel is small but comfortable, located on a quiet street just off a main street. The customer service was great, we had no problems. The rooms are small but I think that's too be expected. They are well maintained and very clean. We stayed at this hotel at two different times during our trip and both times were equally good and the rooms were identical. The location is a little further from the main attractions in Paris, but never more than a 10 min ride on the metro. The metro is very close to the hotel, about a 5-7 min walk. It is extremely accessible. Overall I would defintely recommend this to anyone looking for a clean and comfortable stay but affordable stay in Paris!", "Date": "May 14, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Belambra Clubs - Magendie", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d315166-Reviews-Belambra_Clubs_Magendie-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$107 - $163*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2/4 rue Magendie (corner 6, rue Corvisart)</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75013</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> (Formerly Touring Hotel Magendie)</span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "315166", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/6c/5c/6c5ce277fa898e0efb2c973408a0fb3c7large.jpg"}}
