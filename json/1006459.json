There was not much noise (1st floor - European 1st floor; not ground floor) from the road or other rooms. There was a large screen tv, lots of closet and counter space, beds were good (soft), with a cordless phone and alarm clock. No fridge.

Large mirror and sink. We were treated to a Saint Nicholas gift the next morning (Dec. 6th is Feast Day) that was left on our door handle. Friendly front desk staff. Easy check in.

Hotel can sell you passes to use the public transportation (we bought day passes when we needed them). Hotel itself had excellent staff that spoke English and were super helpful. Rooms were very clean and had plenty of space for 2 people (compared to other hotels we stayed at in Europe). Soap/shampoo combo is from a liquid dispenser in shower. Wasn't a problem for me. Breakfast buffet was great, although very different from the U.S. Lots of cold meats and cheeses, bread, cereals, yogurt and fruit. The area it is in is still a little run down, not the prettiest, but it was great in the hotel itself and I think it was a good value. If you want to be in a fancier area, you'll be paying more. Also, since I live in a city and walk a lot, we walked quite a bit if we didn't want to take the bahn. Sights were not down the street though. It was easy for us to get around, but if you don't like to walk or take the bahn/bus/etc then you might want to look into other places. Wifi is a requirement for me, and it worked fine. I had read it was $10 for 3 days, but I didn't pay anything extra, might have been the package I bought though.

However within a 10 minute walk is the lively Nollendorf area which is full of bars, cafes and restaurants and a mixed, vibrant crowd. The hotel itself is very modern in style, lots of dark slate, low lighting, monochrome furnishing etc. It is stylish but not overly comfortable, particularly if you want a long, lazy breakfast. My partner and I stayed in a penthouse suite on the 6th floor which had a communal roof terrace but no views. The room was spacious and clean with a large bed, long sofa, two flat screen TVs and a wetroom. However, the shower had very weak water pressure and lost water supply twice mid shower. The hotel bar has a very limited range of drinks and the lights are turned off in the evening to conserve power so it is not the best place for pre-dinner drinks. There was a sole member of staff covering phones, reception and the bar in the evening so service can be slow. We had to wait to check in as the receptionist was on the phone when we arrived, tired and hungry. We arrived back at the hotel at 1ish on Satruday morning and some local youths were hanging around a bus stop outside the hotel. They accused my friends and I of being \"rich, middle class\" - we are not, we just dress well - and one followed us into the hotel and started to give us grief. There was no security or attempt to remove him from the hotel and it was only the fact that he was outnumbered 4:1 that seemed to deter him from causing trouble.

Being on the 6th floor the penthouses are well sound proofed from the main road, so we slept well. Only one slight unpleasantness.... being followed into the hotel on the friday by a drunk punk who was vandalising the bus shelter outside the hotel having been at a big party in the building opposite.

Its all very new, although it had an Ikea feel to it. Quite spacious and comforatable. I would have liked a second chair in the room, so that one of us didn't have to sit on the bed or the floor. Be careful when booking online. When I selected the rate with breakfast included, it calculated 'extra person fees' and taxes that amounted to $144 for our 4 night stay. We decided to skip breakfast, but the buffet looked nice and is available for 11 Euro/person. Overall, great value at $55/night!", "Date": "December 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "Flowr", "ReviewID": "UR22867487", "Content": "When I read reviews I always wonder how like myself the writers are so: we are a husband, wife and four-year old: middle-aged professionals. We travel mainly to England, Florida and the Caribeaan. We loved this hotel. A fantastic value. Very close to everything and the staff were super helpful printing off maps and explaining the subway system. They were also great with our sometimes jet-lagged grumpy son. We enjoyed the breakfast--the coffee is fantastic. After reading other reviews we took our own soap, shampoo etc. but there was a dispenser in the shower we could have used. They do not provide face cloths (flannels for the British). We are completely techonologically challenged but after a few tries did not have too much difficulty with the door handles--maybe they have changed them. It was very clean, we felt very safe. They provided a roll out bed for our son. Beautiful bathroom in black slate. The room was not huge but perfectly adequate. No coffeemaker or fridge. TV got CCN and BBC news. No english kid shows. There was a hairdryer. We only ate breakfast there. I think they only offer snacks at other times but I did see another guest ordering in--the front desk has menus from local restaurants. The hotel gave us coupons for 5 euros off our breakfast each day on the one day we did not eat breakfast they took the 5 off our room bill. The alsatian restaurant recommeded by a previous traveller was great. The italian restuarant rec. by the hotel staff is fantastic. We also loved \"hundert biers\" restaurant. If travelling with children: we did not find many places that offered a children's menu or the toys/colouring pages we are used to in Canada--we took our own. Our son loved Lego land (I did,. too). Kindercity is similar to Toronto's Science Ctr. Kidspark--but not as good--and is mostly in german, so if you only speak English may not be a good deal. All the workshops: chocolate, cars etc etc are extra $, only in german and for 6yrs and up. He loved the rides at the Christmas markets. We are not big shoppers but we loved the atmosphere of the markets. We loved the story of Berlin museum, the Dom, the old masters art gallery. Were a bit disappointed with the zoo--prefer Toronto's.", "Date": "December 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cThis was perfect for our stay\u201d", "Author": "Gosomewherenew", "ReviewID": "UR22739898", "Content": "We spent 3 nights here for the Xmas markets and we couldn't fault the place.

The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and the price was brilliant value. We didn't have breakfast but we did make use of the bar after a long day sightseeing.... The immediate vicinity isn't brilliant for bars and restaurants, but this isn't an issue because Berlin has one of the best transport systems going and there is a bus stop directly outside the hotel. Buses from here will take you directly to the Brandenburg Gate in ten minutes and we never waited longer than a few minutes for a bus to arrive. It also has an underground stop 5 minutes away which in 45 minutes including a short bus journey the other end gets you to Shoenfield airport for a few euros.", "Date": "December 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cSpacious rooms, clean and efficient.\u201d", "Author": "bckrSTHLM", "ReviewID": "UR22473352", "Content": "We stayed in one of the larger rooms at a superb rate with a terrace connected to the room.

Great hotel and very helpful staff. I didn't bother posting my pictures of the hotel because everything is completely brand new and in excellent condition - exactly as you see posted on their website. By far the best hotel I stayed in during my 2 week in Germany and Austria, and surprisingly, the cheapest as well. The hotel is in a good location, albeit a bit of a hike to some of the main attractions if you're walking. It was rather cold while I was there so I cabbed to most of the places I went and never paid more than $10 to get anywhere. I highly recommend springing for the breakfast that they offer - its well worth the money. I stayed in one of the \"Lifestyle\" rooms which is a bit larger than the Standard room. While it was a great room, if I stayed there again I would stay in a Standard room. The Lifestyle rooms face the front of the building and you hear a lot of noise from traffic well into the middle of the night (which you become painfully aware of if jet lagged like myself). The hotel is on Potsdamer Strasse which is a 4 lane major thoroughfare for the city. The Standard rooms face the back of the building where there is just a parking lot and I suspect those rooms are much quieter. I hope to get back to Berlin soon and will definitely stay here again.", "Date": "December 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely wonderful customer service and location!!!!\u201d", "Author": "WorldCitizen2009", "ReviewID": "UR22139931", "Content": "We had a wonderful 3 day stay at this hotel. The acommodations were equivalent to 4 and 5 star hotels we stayed in in Prague, Budapest and Vienna. It is a brand new hotel so the entire facility is spotless. All linens, furniture, and fixtures are new and modern. We paid $72 cad. per night. The location is strategic and central. We were a 20 min. walk away from every single attraction and site in Berlin. We walked everywhere the entire 3 days we were there. The street has several markets, restaurants and a Lidl grocery store around the corner where you can purchase wines and cheeses for 1 euro. Absolutely incredible! All the restaurants were cheap as well as shops on the street. Potsdammer is the main street (the hotel is on this street) with most attractions. Our stay was memorable because of the friendly and extremely knowledgeable staff who had information on everything possible we could ask them. We took a train from Berlin to Vienna. The station is 15 minutes away from the hotel. A great convenience! Most of the guests seemed to be European. The breakfast is geared to this group. We did not have breakfast at the hotel since there are half a dozen cafes and bakeries on the street where we stopped off for treats.

There is so much positive but there is also a lot more that could be done that wouldn't take much effort on the hotel's part, but would create a much better experience for the clients overall. The hotel staff is an asset - one staff member especially provided excellent service - the others tried very hard although did not quite reach the same level. The rooms are of a good size and have excellent storage space. In-room wifi is a reasonable EUR5 per day, although it really should be included in the room rate. Breakfast appears to be reasonably priced at EUR11 although we declined to take it. The shower is excellent. The rooms offer plenty of natural light due to their massive windows looking out onto Potsdamer Str. Unfortunately, the designers failed to take into account the fact that guests might wish to enjoy the natural light while not necessarily wishing the entire street to see what they are doing. Consequently, the windows could either be covered by thick blackout drapes or not at all - why could they not have provided window nets for example? There was no safe in the room at all and the door lock to the room was made unnecessarily complicated - it took at least 3 attempts to open it every time, even after a few days of getting used to it. No mini bar either. What really disappointed was the lack of toiletries in the room. The bathroom consisted of a single soap dispenser located over the sink, which meant having to get out of the shower just to get some soap. It turns out that there is no complimentary soap/shampoo available and these items are charged for at reception. This is disappointing when the rate hovers around EUR90 per night. Housekeeping is also poor - there was a large amount of dust on the bedside table which wasn't cleaned at all during our stay. The hotel is well connected to the public transit network in Berlin and reaching all parts of the city and its airports is very easy. Nevertheless, the neighbourhood is one of the less affluent of the city and while it felt perfectly safe to us, other travellers might have a different impression. I put some of my thoughts to the receptionist on checking out but they were immediately dismissed and I was told simply to close the blackout drapes if I had wanted privacy. I would consider staying here again only as a last resort - it could be so much better, the potential is there and the staff is certainly willing, it just needs some fine tuning and it could be a decent hotel.", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sweden", "Title": "\u201cNew hotel in excellent location\u201d", "Author": "MariaHSweden", "ReviewID": "UR19570751", "Content": "My husband, me and a couple of our friends just returned from a 2 night stay at Lindemann's. The hotel had opened the day before our arrival, so its brand new, modern and very clean. The staff was friendly and helpful at all times. We arrived very early for our check in after a long night travelling, and they had no troubles in giving us our rooms, we just waited half an hour for them to be cleaned and were able to rest and shower before heading to town. The hotel is very close to 2 U Bahn stations. (Bulowstr. and Kleistpark) that take you very quickly to anywhere in Berlin. Trains run often so you have no problem getting around. You can buy day, group and single passes at the hotel. Depending how much walking you'll be doing it might be enough with 2 single tickets per person per day. We used one ticket to get to our starting point and then walk from there. Then use another ticket on the way home. I would recommend you take cash with you, since most of the restaurants do not take credit cards, only cash. We had breakfast at the hotel, which was also very good and with lots of options (fresh bread, fruit, yogurth, lots of hams and cheeses, eff, bacon, cold and hot drinks etc...) It cost 11 Euros if its not included in your package. There is also parking at the hotel, which was included in our room, but I think it costs like 8 Euros for every 24 hour period. I can very highly recommend this hotel!
