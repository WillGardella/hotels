From the moment we arrived, the staff were very welcoming and friendly, had a good grasp of English and could not do enough for us. The location was perfect, walking distance to Forbidden City and the Metro station is right next to the hotel. The rooms were very comfortable, and the bathroom was huge with a separate shower and bath. The breakfast buffet was excellent and the cosy hotel lobby is a great place for a hot chocolate after a day of sightseeing.

After making reservation for a week-stay at the Regent hotel Beijing via an online source, I sent the concierge an email asking about transportation to-from the airport. I got a reply within 24 hours complete with pricing and types of cars etc. I also asked for help with making a reservation at the Li Family restaurant, and within one day, the concierge replied again in the affirmative.While checking in, the clerk asked if I wanted an upgrade to a suite, including free daily breakfast. The existing reservation for a regular room (including taxes) was about $175 per night. With the upgrade to a suite, my price was $250 nightly. It was worth every penny. The suite was huge with luxurious wood paneling large livingroom and bedroom with one full bath (tub and shower) and a powder room. There were two flat screen TVs, glass walls and great views of the city. The bed, unlike many ohter in China, was very soft and the linens were luxurious. There is a metro station beneath the hotel and travel on Beijing's subway system was clean, cheap, and efficient.The Regent's lobby is high class and subdued with elegance. The piano music provided a relaxing break from the hectic streets of the city, and you can drool over the Lamborgini and Bentley showrooms attached to the hotel.The hotel was nice enough to hold our luggage while we went on a 2-day jaunt to Xi'an. The Regent is less than 3 years old and the fit and finish of the design and comfort is very high. The service level is excellent as most employees spoke passable English. The few minor complaints I have is with the breakfast buffet and the check-in time. The cogee was cold as was the sausage and noodles. And, although there is an egg prep station, it was not manned the day that I was there for an early breakfast at 6 am--I couldn't help it since I was jet lagged, hungry and bored. The chef was there when I ate breakfast later in the morning. I checked in at around 10 am and the clerk told me I would have to wait a few hours, or I could take the upgrade to a suite, which was ready for occupation immediatley. I found this sales tactic a bit pushy, but I took the bait and loved the suite.Overall, this is the best hotel I've used in a long time. It's highly recommened, especially if you can swing for the suite.", "Date": "Nov 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR554343917", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "G35Traveler"}, {"Content": "Best hotel in Central Beijing The Regent is my favorite hotel in central Beijing.

Beijing Regent was initially a very luxurious experience for us travelling as a family. A great place to relax and spend the night especially after climbing the great wall. However, we did not have a very good experience with their facilities. One of our family members took one of the hotel cups to wash in the basin, without knowing that the handle can be detached from the cup. There was no warning sign either. Because of this, when he emptied the water from the cup, it fell straight out of the handle and there was a crack in the cup. When we checked out, we were charged RMB 280.00 just for this small damage!! So, if you are checking in this hotel, please be aware of this. The housekeepers also do not regularly replace the toiletries. If you have less than half a bottle of body wash left, they will not replace it!The hairdryer in our room was also terrible.

Actually I booked the Park Plaza (on the same property) via the web, but that was full when I arrived and so I got a free upgrade to the Regent. (I read that in other reviews, so this seems common policy.)The hotel is really posh, with all the things demanding travellers (which I am not) look for: HUGE lobby, several bars with Piano player all day etc.The room was very luxurious (e.g. brand new flat screen with CD player - which I didn't turn on because I didn't have the time), with free internet access (if you bring your own laptop).The location is GREAT: Easy walking distance to Wangfujing, the main shopping street, and also Tian'anmen and Forbidden City(ca. 20 minutes walk).Only some minor details: The toilet was not really clean when I used it the first time (yellow stains on the seat), and the shower tended to flood the whole bathroom... - but that seems to be a general problem with 21st century fantasy marble showers: Beauty goes over functionality...But for the rest, an overall great experience. I am not giving the best mark because I was really disgusted by the stains in the toilet, which made me think that management might stress superficial poshness more than thorough quality control, but maybe I was unlucky. Remark concerning the neighborhood (has of course NOTHING to do with the hotel!):Rapidly developing area, with the last old buildings currently being knocked down to make place for modern high-rise buildings. Many other travelers warn against friendly students chatting you up when stepping out of the hotel and yes, this is true, but a phenomenon to be experienced EVERYWHERE in Beijing: These young people just start talking to you and walk with you (no matter what the destination), claim that they are art students, and suddenly (sometimes after 30 minutes of friendly chatting) they invite you to an art gallery where they claim you can buy cheap paintings etc. I never followed them, they are to be got rid of easily enough, but I heard of people who got into nasty situations (Not being allowed to leave the exhibition without buying something etc.) So simply DON'T GO THERE. If you are a Chang Bizi (a long nose as Caucasians are called by the Chinese), you will invariably have such an encounter in Beijing. On the other hand, I invited one such guy to a quick beer in the many outlets on Wangfujing, and we parted friendly enough.

And i have to say that although this hotel is nice, its by no means a top class hotel by todays standards. I stayed in a Executive room, and a one bedroom suite (with connecting twin premium). Yes the rooms look nice, but upon closer inspection they are quite dirty, with dirt mounds behind doors, and muck under bathroom counters. The daily cleaning is not very good as well. On two different stays the housekeeps did not wash used forks, or glasses and just left them sitting out. The showers (both my stays) seemed to have quite a bit of old residue in them. Room service was left in the corridors for extended periods of time as well. Complementary bottles are not replaced more than once a day (if that) and toiletries were not replaced at all during either of my stays. They seems very cheap with these sort of things. The rooms was not 'tidied' as well on several occasions, i.e. Not straightening coffee tables and sofa cushions. Overall giving the rooms a half cleaned feel. The rooms were also very noisy and hot. The noise came from outside the hotel, a building being constructed 24hrs a day (this is China). I think this affects one side of the hotel more than the other. The club lounge was quite good, and a great benefit. However it seemed that they only had one Joss Stone CD to play the whole time, on both of my stays. Quite annoying after a while. However, breakfast was good, and evening drinks is a nice way to wind down. Is this hotel nice? Yes. Is it great?

The first stay I booked through Expedia, and on the recommendation of hotel staff, I joined the Regent/Radisson/Park Plaza executive club (no fee). On the first visit, the standard room was exceptional and well beyond my expectations considering the very affordable rate. The staff was exceptional -with valets who were quick to argue with cab drivers on our behalf before we asked for help. The desk staff was very helpful, and if you happen to meet the Dutch woman who works evenings -she is amazing. After three weeks of traveling and trekking around China, I realized how outstanding this hotel really is. It is modern, exceptionally clean, and meticulously maintained -truly a five star hotel. On my second visit, I was upgraded to the executive suite for no additional charge, with breakfast and happy hour included. I ended up not leaving the hotel that day... a trip to the pool and the spa turned into an all day event, simply because no one else was there and it seemed a waste not to take advantage of the facility. This is not a backpacker's China, but it is certainly a welcomed luxury for any tired traveler or business traveler. Tips for the budget conscious -the Park Plaza is attached to the Regent and shares the pool/spa facilities (not sure about the rooms, but they are of the same vintage. It seems to book up faster and I've heard they upgrade you to the Regent (same fee) if they overbook.

If you're looking for a fabulous hotel in Beijing, look no further! The Regent Beijing is as memorable as the historic sites we went to see. Personally, I don't think the Emperors of China had it this good.The hotel is barely a year old which means it was designed with the most up to date amenities. Our deluxe room was incredibly spacious and beautiful in decor. Of course, it has all the usual conveniences and amenities of a top shelf five star hotel, ie. flat screen LCD tv, dvd/cd player, featherbed, high thread count sheets, fluffy towels, marble bathroom, etc... But they had a bit more. The bathroom has a free standing bathtub and separate shower. The shower has both a rainshower shower head and a hand held shower. They also provide bath salts and bubble bath.The location is ideal. The hotel is within walking distance of the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, the night market (food stalls), Dragonfly (massages) and Starbucks (to the left of the hotel). If you're adventurous, the subway is next to the lobby. It's the Dengshikou stop on the number 5 line (just opened Oct. '07). Unfortunately, getting to the hotel is a problem. None of the cab drivers know where it is. BE SURE TO HAVE THE HOTEL'S PHONE NUMBER ON HAND so the driver can call and ask for directions. Or even better, print out the map on their website. Once you're at the hotel, ask them for a card with the hotel name and address in Chinese. This will help you get back.The restaurants are top notch. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet at Cafe 99 and the ribeye steak at the Bar  Grill. Let's not forget the great spa, gym and heated pool. Definitely shedule a massage in the evening. You'll sleep even better afterwards.Service is good overall. Everyone is very courteous. However, they could brush up on their English skills. Check in was very disappointing. We arrived from NY on a direct flt. (16 hrs.) at 5:30 PM and were told we had to come back in an hour because the room wasn't ready. We didn't get a good first impression but that was the only glitch. Fortunately, checking out was a breeze.We've stayed in numerous 5 star hotels around the world and we thought the Regent Beijing had the most beautifully appointed rooms.
