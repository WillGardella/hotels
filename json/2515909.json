The hotel is very well placed for Downtown Disney (appox 5/10 mins drive) there are plenty of eating places around the hotel, some within walking distance. Comments have been made regarding getting in and out of this hotel. I found driving down (Towards Tampa) and exiting at 68? the entrance is no more than 100yards from the exit road, very very easy. The entrance could have a larger sign. Coming out of the hotel you have to turn right (Dual carrigeway) drive towards the traffic lights, u turn and back to the I4. If you cannot manage this very simple task you should not be driving.

It happens and I hope I can steer you away from making the same mistake I did. First, don't let the high rank on this hotel fool you. YOU DON'T WANT TO STAY HERE! Here's the list, draw your own conclusions: 1. This is an old Radisson and the walls are barely there, I could here multiple conversations going on at the same time, all night long. 2. We asked for a feather-free room (my son and wife are very allergic) which we din't get so I called for some different pillows and we waited 30 minutes, I called again and still no pillows, they called me back to ask if I got them (there one positive point in the whole stay) but still nothing, an hour later, pillows but we forgot to mention the bedspread which we checked and was feather as well. We just put it in the corner of the room. 3. The street just outside the hotel is a nightmare. We drove to the Uno's (see map for this) which is within walking distance but it looked like it would rain pretty hard so that's why we drove. From the Uno's back to the hotel took 50 minutes (I am not exaggerating this). We had to turn left on to the road which took a few light cycles to do this then wait on the street until we could move past the hotel, down the street to the next possible place to do a u-turn, wait some more and then finally into the parking lot....50 minutes, let that sink in for a moment. 4. Beds are old, small, and worn out. We were planning to stay there all week but I didn what I have never done before, I made the call down that night and cancelled that rest of our stay and we went to Fairfield Inn & Suites Orlando Near Universal Orlando Resort which is a very good hotel, see my review of that one for more information.

There was the sound of someone sliding a room key but it was not accepted, gazing through the peephole on the door I saw a family standing there.

Be warned the suites are near the lifts, you can hear them from the room but they aren't too loud and it didn't bother us. The rooms were clean and fairly well appointed but the bathroom fell short of the usual Radisson decor. The rest of the hotel was very poor. I've never stayed at a hotel where I've had to take my luggage to my room using the bellboy trolleys myself. I don't know if this is temporary or permanent arrangement but over the 4 days the other guests had to do the same. The cleaners left cleaning cloths on the floor and refuse sacks in the bed?! I always eat breakfast in a hotel (at least once) but the lobby, bar and restaurant area looked so uninviting and free from guests that I didn't bother. The pool area was average and it didn't have a children's area. The gym was absolutely pitiful - a 2 metre by 3 metre room with a running machine and useless multi gym. Make sure you sort out your Disney tickets in advance if you want to save money. We didn't but there is a desk in the hotel. A word of warning though, these guys seem to work for Starwood as they pushed the time share (you can save approx $160 off the price of Disney tickets if you attend a morning session). They are completely transparent and I told them I wasn't interested because of time restraints but they still went on and on about it. Even worse buying tickets from them doesn't provide any advantage (cost or speed) over the gate as they sell you a vochure that you have to convert into tickets at the normal ticket queue. The hotel is extremely close to Downtown Disney but its surroundings leave a lot to be desired with a freeway on two sides and a retail park on the other two. Without question this hotel offers good value for money and they don't layer on the resort charges, parking etc that every other hotel in Florida does. The rooms are fine but the facilities and service are very poor. The location whilst convenient don't provide any opportunities to stroll as the surroundings are awful. If you want a cheap, clean crash pad to recover from the parks this is a good choice. If you want a little more from you surroundings you'll be disappointed.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel big rooms\u201d", "Author": "ByPast", "ReviewID": "UR127056026", "Content": "Stayed here on a trip to Orlando.

We did not rent a car, utilized the shuttle services to Disney and Outlet mall. There were also city bus and trolley options, which we used. However, even though we did not have a car, we don't think the U-turn on the highway, many people complained of, was that big of a deal. Some friends wintering in the area, picked us up for a day trip to the beach, they had no problem with access to the hotel. We had a room on the back side of the hotel, didn't hear anything, and I am a light sleeper. Not really a sleep number bed fan, which is the ONLY reason I didn't rate this hotel as excellent, but I know many people do love those beds. Bed types are just personal preference. We didn't find the salespeople at the ticket desk, overly pushy, the timeshare ones, were just trying to do their job. But we nicely stated, we weren't interested in those tickets, and the other salesperson helped us. For those wanting a good discount, it may be worth your time, to hear the pitch, we weren't interested in that part. She did her best to promote the idea, without being overly push. We really loved the restaurant dinner items, and the dinner rolls, were to die for. The brunch was so-so, but we mostly had breakfast at the fantastic Waffle House, right across the parking lot. My husband and I, split the All-Star breakfast, it was a great plenty and the pecan waffles, are fantastic. If you take the trolley, from the first outlet mall, to the one on International Drive, know there are many stops, can take nearly an hour.

The more interaction we had with the rest of the hotel personnel, you could really see that the same positive, helpful approach was encouraged in everyone - a special mention to Luke in the Bar who make us some amazing cocktails and passed on some great tips about the local area! The rooms are a good size and have a fridge and microwave which is great when you want to reheat the boxed up remainder of the huge meals you just cant finish in one sitting! The room was cleaned really well every day - even when we left the room late. The sleep number beds took a bit of getting used to, but we found them fine. The internet in reception worked well (the best PC is on the right hand side!) and printing facilities are free .. again, another really good feature of this hotel. Wifi was great and could always be accessed in the room. There are fresh cookies availiable in reception every evening - I can highly recommend them ... we never made it to dessert when we were out for a meal, so this was a nice treat to end the evening. The swimming pool wasn't heated during our stay which would've been nice, but the hot tub was lovely to sit in and de-stress. The parks were easily accessible from the hotel (the entrance to Disney is literally a 10 minute walk away!) and there are plenty of restaurants (can recommend the Olive Garden, Ale House and Flippers Pizza!) and a good supermarket within walking distance. As mentioned by other reviews, access to the hotel could be improved as it's located on a 3 lane motorway and there is no slipway to enter the hotel from the other side of the road, so you do find yourself performing u-turns. This did not dampen our experience however and was just accepted as one of those things. The only other thing that would've made the experience complete would be if the hotel had spa facilities - a nice relaxing massage at the end of a long day at the parks would be great! From a UK traveller perspective, the car hire facility in the hotel is not a particularly attractive option as its really foccused on the American market (all kinds of insurance are added if you don't have an American licence) so we hired a car from Alamo which was located at the Palace hotel opposite Disney.

Being a holiday weekend, we were having trouble finding good rates. I looked at several hotels online, and I had several criteria I wanted in a hotel 1) no resort fees 2) free parking 3) free shuttle to Disney 4) free breakfast 5) clean rooms with fairly updated d\u00e9cor (this can be very important in Orlando where many of the older area hotels feature Golden Girls style wicker furniture, flowered bedspreads that were purchased in 1990, and probably not washed since then either, and outdated bathrooms, carpet, etc). This hotel fit the bill for the lowest price. The only thing it didn\u2019t offer was the free breakfast, but that was ok, it did have a microwave and fridge. Since we were just driving up from Miami, we brought our own food and just made breakfast in the room every morning. Even if you can\u2019t bring your own food, there are tons of restaurants in the area, and even a Waffle House that is actually in the same parking lot as the hotel. The free shuttle actually goes to Disney about 3 times in the morning and comes back several times in the afternoon and it also goes to Universal and the shopping outlets once a day (the schedule is on the hotel\u2019s website). The times can be limiting, so we actually had to drive to the park one day, but we took the shuttle the next day and it worked out fine. The only thing I would say that could make this limited shuttle better would be if they provided an earlier shuttle to Disney\u2019s Tickets and Transportation Center. The earliest one goes at 9:50 from the hotel and you have to stop and pick up guests at another resort. By the time you get to the TTC and then take transportation to the park, you won\u2019t be getting there till at least 10:30-11:00 and the parks open at 9:00. The only other complaint was that the free WiFi didn\u2019t work in our room. It did work in the lobby, however, so maybe if you try getting a room closer to the lobby the WiFi may work. The customer service was very good, and the room was updated and clean and quiet. The size of the room was adequate for two people, maybe even four, but I would think it would be a little cramped to put more than that in there. We would definitely stay here again if visiting Disney.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bath", "Title": "\u201cGood price,nice big clean rooms,well run,good nearby facilities\u201d", "Author": "allanm09", "ReviewID": "UR123184191", "Content": "This hotel is in very good condition; neat, tidy, clean; helpful staff, good room.

We normally stay at the Marriott village opposite but thought we would try out this hotel due to the reviews. On arriving I was offered a jacuzzi suite for an upgraded price. I accepted this offer not fully realising that as well as losing a whole double bed this also meant no bath tub in the bathroom and just a shower. As we were travelling with a baby a bath tub was needed and bathing a baby in a jacuzzi didn't prove to be that easy! The crib we had requested was great but finding a space for it was also a challenge due to the jacuzzi and the room being actually no larger than a standard room. The jacuzzi rooms I was told were at the front of the hotel and I should have took that as a warning because the noise from the motorway was very intrusive actually waking me during the night at times. As we had several cases and baby items and shopping etc we decided to bear the noise rather than have the hassle of switching rooms and re packing. The beds were adjustable but mine seemed to have a low battery and I would set it before going to sleep and woke up with it either as solid as a brick or so soft that I was lying on the floor. The combination of the bed and the noise all contributed to poor sleep. My final gripe was the supposed high speed internet. This would not connect several times and when it did connect I kept being kicked out every few minutes. I called reception who sent up the technical guy who commented that their Internet doesn't work very well with apple devices. I commented on leaving the hotel that with the iPad 2 and iPhone being the best sellers in their categories, the Internet not working well with apple was a serious flaw. Reception assured me that they were just having technical problems with the wifi. On the plus sides the hotel location is fantastic, it is very clean and well presented And staff were very helpful. I did not use the pool as I heard it was un heated so decided against using it. I have rated this hotel as good purely because the staff at the end of my stay were sympathetic when I mentioned my issues and did sincerely apologise and to me that goes a long way!

One confirmation was submitted to my email address; and after finding a different hotel I preferred to stay at during my visit to Orlando, I canceled my reservation through the link attached to the inital confirmation in the appropriate time I was given to avoid any charges being made to my credit card; and I was issued an cancellation number. While driving on the Florida turnpike (from Michigan) the day following the arrival date I was initally supposed to have checked in, a female from this hotel called my cell phone inquiring if I was still arriving at their hotel (sounded pretty desperate to me for business). I informed the individual that I had canceled the reservation and had a cancellation number in my email account and I was driving on the highway and that I needed to remain focused since traffic was somewhat congested. Nevertheless, she goes on to inform me that they (the hotel) didn't have a cancellation for me. I once again informed her that she was calling my cell phone while I was driving on the highway; and she goes on to inquire if I could forward the cancellation to her email address. DUH? What part of I am driving on the highway didn't she understand? I then informed her that when I arrived to where I was going, I would print the cancellation and bring it to her. She then goes on to ask me if I were in the Orlando area? DUH AGAIN! How many times had I informed her that I was driving on the highway enroute to this area? Anyways, when I arrived to the beautiful resort I elected to stay in, I was extremely exhausted being that I was the only driver in my vehicle; so, I checked in, showered and went to sleep. The following day, I had a strict schedule to adhere to and was not able to take the canceled reservation to this hotel; so, I wait until the next day, open my email and OMG, I have an email from this hotel asking me to submit to a survey for a one night stay. Huh? Immediately, I decided to check my bank account and discovered this hotel had charged me for a one night stay subsequent to me informing their representative that I had canceled the reservation; so, here comes the good part. When I arrive at the hotel with my canceled reservation, I am told that I made two reservations? Huh? Whoever I initially spoke to when making the reservation obviously has a hearing problem because I informed the reservation agent that I was making one (1) reservation for two (2) adults. Why did she list on my reservation I had a party of four (4) adults? Then, the front desk tells me that I made the reservation online. I told the woman that I did not make the reservation online, I called directly into the hotel because had I made the reservation online, I would have made it through my Gold Points account and this reservation was not in my Gold Points account; and that she could open my account to verify it. Then, she tells me that I made two reservations under the same confirmation number. If this were true, then, when I canceled the one reservation, the other reservation should have canceled also. Hmm, this seems correct to me. Okay, I was seeing how desperate they were in thinking I was going to yield to allowing them to keep money from my account that they had already fraudulently charged me for; so, I stood my grounds with informing them that I did NOT make two reservations; and they stood there toying with their system until I pulled out my cell phone and called my bank in their presence. All of sudden, the IGNORANT front desk manager tells the billing representative to refund my money because they didn't want to continue dealing with the issue. This raised a concern with both me and the representative from my bank (who heard her) and I reported the matter to the FRAUD department at my bank because it was very obvious that this hotel doubles the reservation on people who cancels their reservation as a measure of charging the customer for at least one night when the customer decides not to stay at their hotel. They stood in my face and told so many LIES, it was both pathetic and unprofessional. Had I made the reservation online, why would I list my name as Mrs. when that is not my appropriate title? Why wouldn't the reservation be listed in my Gold Points account? Why would I make a reservation for four adults when I was only traveling with my daughter? Why wouldn't I choose the AAA rate opposed to their best available rate (which is always higher)? BE CAREFUL WHEN MAKING RESERVATIONS DIRECTLY WITH THIS HOTEL BECAUSE IF YOU CHOOSE TO CANCEL, TEN TIMES OUT OF TEN, YOU'RE GOING TO BE PENALIZED FOR DECIDING NOT TO STAY AT THEIR HOTEL WHEN THERE ARE OTHER HOTELS THAT ARE MORE QUALITATIVE THAN THEIRS! I'm sure the majority of all of these GOOD REVIEWS are made by hotel employees. Nothing is perfect; and I have come to discover that this hotel actually is pitiful! I would suggest to anyone to sustain your cancellation number because if you don't, it is their word against yours and ten times out of ten, you will not get your money back. Now, this is a primary example of how businesses seek to take advantage of consumers in these extreme economic times. How pathetic! I wouldn't suggest this hotel to no one, even if they paid me to do it!

Although marketed as being in WDW, it is outside. Of course this is both a blessing and a curse. Disney downtown is walkable, but get ready for a good 30 minute walk. The bigger issue is that the shuttle transport is lacking. The times are fixed and there is only one run each way each day. The times are not overly covenient- you will do well to catch it in the morning and evening without going well out of your way. The other flaw is that the hotel does not offer free breakfast.

All shines at this newly reoldeled facility, with no resort fee's , no sales pressure, just a relaxing time and great service. Save your $$$ on lodging and use them on the rest of your Orlando tour.

The beds were sleep number beds which allowed us to create our own level of comfort. We were on the 6th floor, back side of the hotel and we did not hear any noise. No doors opening and closing, no freeway noise, just the occasional toilet and sometimes we could hear the elevator. There is a waffle house that shares the hotel driveway and a tiny expensive \"supermarket\" within walking distance of the hotel. However if you rent a car I would highly suggest you drive North on Apopka Vineland Rd about a mile to the Winn-Dixie or South on Apopka Vineland Rd about 3 miles to the Walmart. There is also a IHOP within a half mile of the hotel. I would not rely on the hotel shuttle to take you to and from the parks or Dwntn Disney as it has limited pickup and drop off time.

Best impression-the staff. Extremely friendly despite extremely diverse clientele. You realize people come from all over the world to go to Disney and the same goes for this hotel. The bilingual staff is amazing to watch and they bend over backwards even when are room was not ready when we arrived. It has a comfortable lobby with access to beautiful bathrooms(when your teenage daughter is a bathroom lover and you need a back up). There is a restaurant off the lobby but honestly did not see anyone there-also a bar but that was not our seen. I cannot say anything but positive things about the hotel interior,extremely clean, comfortable and spacious 2 queen bed suites. Funny thing is all the pizza fliers when we arrived back at night under our doors.It really made us laugh.Refrigerator in the room. Hot tub and pool are comfortable but the pool chairs definitely could use updating. Again you will hear traffic noise at the pool but if you want quiet Disney is not where you will find it. Don't go to the adjacent grocery store complex. I never saw a more expensive, shady grocery store.

Parking is free, and the room is equipped with a large LCD TV, microwave and fridge. The beds have individually adjustable mattresses (you can change the softness for each side of the bed using a remote control). The hotel is located very close to the Disneyworld entrance and to the Interstate 4, and this is both an advantage and a disadvantage, since, if you are driving to/from the hotel, you may get easily stuck in traffic going to or coming from Disneyworld, Pleasure Island and Downtown Disney. This happened to me at least twice during my stay. However, I don't recall hearing noises from the highway in our room. Orlando Premium Outlets is just across the highway (about one mile), while the Orange County Convention Center and SeaWorld Orlando are only 5 miles away. Universal Studios are located about 7 miles from the hotel. Unfortunately it's not possible to buy park tickets in the hotel (at least the Disney Parks): they sell only special packages and not \"plain\" tickets.

Flying back to the UK we really appreciated this as we didnt have to move all our luggage and try to keep it secure for hours. All in all I cant say enough good stuff about this place and I look forward to visiting again in a few weeks time.

Usually a quiet part of the year, but this was the weekend when Magic Kingdom celebrated their 40th anniversary, so the first weekend was a little busy after all. Hotel location is fantastic, in the middle of the Disney World. For our first day to the parks, we took a shuttle bus, that brought us to the parking at Magic Kingdom. For the rest of the week, we took our own car. Just a few minutes drive to Epcot, Typhoon Lagoon and all the fun, dining and entertainment at Downtown Disney. Within 5 minutes drive you find a large selection of convenient stores, restaurants, hotels and outlets. Hotel rooms are large, and ours # 816 on the top floor had a sofabed, an office chair and a writing table in addition to two queen beds. We lived here for a week, and never felt the room was too crowded. Bath was spacious and had a shower/bathtub. Cleaning was extremely good and daily turndown service the same. Breakfast was not included in room price, and we could choose from different menues. Selection was quite good and sufficient, so we did not get fed up even after a week. Service at front desk and restaurant was at all times very good, helpful, friendly and informative. A lobby bar offers refreshments. Hotel has an outdoor pool and hot tub on the ground floor with a pool bar. Not a lot of noise despite a lot of traffic just outside. A nice and clean fitness room is also located on ground floor.

The air conditioning in the room is great and works very well, we had a room overlooking the crossroads restaurants area and so had no problem with the noise from the highway, The room had free internet which was easy to use and a good speed, free parking and no resort fees. There was a bar and restaurant at the hotel which looked nice but we did not use as lots of restaurants right next door to the hotel and Downtown Disney can also be reached in 25 mins walk or 5 mins by car. The parks are all easily accessable from the hotel, as other reviews have commented you do need to do a u turn when returning to the hotel from the other side of the road but this didn't cause us any problems at all. There is a nice pool area with plenty of towels and sunbeds available and they have done a very nice job of secluding the area so you feel like you are not on the main road. There is also a small gym area which looked nice but we never used. All the staff we encountered were very friendly and proffessional.

No Resort Fees. I had narrowed down my two affordable choices or Tripadvisor's top 10 in Orlando to The Point Orlando and this Radisson. I chose the Radisson because The Point Orlando had a ridiculous resort fee ($11+/night)... more than other \"resorts.\" Driving in from Philly, we checked in early at 2pm on 8/22/11. We were given room 815. Check-in was painless. Staff was WONDERFUL.. Free chocolate chip cookies at the desk. We had a room with 2 queen beds. Room size was fine. So was the Chimei HD Television...BUT there's only like 4 HD Chennels. The other 40+ channels are standard def, and if you've ever attempted to watch a standard def program on a hi-def screen, you know how unwatchable it is. Anyway, the 4 hi-def channels looked AMAZING on the monitor.. The Sleep Number beds were nice, as well. We all put the mattress down to the lowest number for maximum comfort. Housekeeping is awesome. Esmeralda is awesome. They respected our Do Not Disturb sign...we just had to initial their clipboard when you see them in the hallway in the morning. Internet is excellent. you have Ethernet in your room (just bring your own ethernet cable) and STRONG wi-fi throughout the hotel. No complaints...if you log on with your cell phone, you'll have to keep going through their log-on page and your phone gets disconnected when it powers down, so you won't get all your push-emails and notifications until you re-connect using your phone's browser. Location is pretty perfect. there's a strip mall next to the hotel with a Bank Of America ATM and a 24 hour supermarket called Gooding's, among other (like 6!!!) restaurants. Beware of buying discount tickets in the lobby. I attempted to do this on 8/23/11 in the morning. You can only get a discount if you attend their 90 minute timeshare sales pitch. I told them I'd do it if I was there for like 2 weeks, but I was only there for a couple of days. They must be giving the chick a great commision, because even after I lied and said I was only there for a day, she STILL tried to get me to go to the 90 minute timeshare sale pitch. LOL. If she was cool and said, \"you know, enjoy Disney for the day you're here...don't waste half your day on this,\" I WOULD HAVE attended the timeshare presentation. But chica was only thinking about her commision and not the hotel guests best interests...which I undestand, I guess. I did make a rookie mistake. The hotel has several warnings telling you NOT to order from the pizza menus that people slip under the door. However, I ordered anyway. I ordered from this pizza place and there was no address on the menu (even though they said they're available for dine-in...LOL!!!) and a Google search turned up nothing. So please, this is for anyone staying in Orlando, DO NOT ORDER FROM THE PIZZA MENUS SLIPPED UNDER YOUR DOOR.. We had to check out early the evening (5:30pm) of 8/24/11 because of the NONSTOP warnings about Hurricane Irene on television every 10 minutes. I was hoping they'd give me some sort of deal especially since I told them earlier that morning that I would be checking out at 5:30pm...like some sort of nominal penalty fee that added up to only half of the room or something, but they still made me pay for the entire night. They porbably still were able to rent the room out to latecomers who came to check in after 7pm. I completely understood why, but was still looking for another deal. :-D All in all, I'm going to make sure I come back to the Radisson next time I'm in Orlando.

We stayed with friends in July (a visit which we never got around to reviewing) and then again just as our family this past Labor Day weekend. We already have this hotel booked for stays in October, November and December. And once we decide on firm dates for 2012, we will start booking stays when we plan to visit next year. We are out of state Disney Annual Passholders; and the Radisson LBV is our hotel of choice when coming to Orlando to visit the Disney theme parks. The location is very convenient to all the Disney Parks as well as as Downtown Disney. We used to stay on property at a Disney moderate hotel. But after finding this hotel, we stay here instead of on Disney property. In our opinion, this hotel is nicer, the rooms cleaner and larger, and a better price value. The rooms are very clean. Housekeeping is thorough. The housekeeper even made some towel animals for my children one day this last visit. The room furnishings are nice and everything was in working order. The bed linens were crisp and clean. The fold out sofa bed was made up prior to our arrival as well so it was nice not to have to struggle to make that up -- especially since we arrived after midnight our first night! I do have to agree with a previous review though about the pillows needing to be a little better. On our first visit it was hard getting used to the sleep number beds but now that we have figured out our numbers, they sleep good. The room also has a desk with ergo chair if you need to work. My son loved using the desk to put together the Lego set he purchased at the Lego store at Downtown Disney. There is also a counter top / cabinet area that contains a refrigerator, coffee maker and an overhead microwave. The refrigerator seemed to cool better and was larger than most in other hotels we have stayed in. The bathroom was very clean and supplied with ample soap, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and mouth wash. The towels were very white and clean. The shower curtain and liner were both very clean and hung on a curved rod to make the shower seem roomier. The TV was in excellent working order and had a very clear picture. It is a wall-mounted flat screen so it doesn't take up extra space on the dresser. We had no problems with the wi-fi working in comparison with some of the previous reviews. The hotel and its rooms are quiet. I've stayed in other hotels where the halls were noisy and you could hear the folks next door - this is not the case here. Some other reviews mention that they have heard noise from streets from outside the hotel. We have never had this issue. We didn't visit the pool or hot tub this visit. However, in July we did and both were clean and towels were furnished. It is a good-sized kidney-shaped pool. If your children are looking for water slides and such, you won't find that here. It's just a basic but clean pool and pool area. We stay at the parks from open to close usually so that is not an issue for us. There was a pool bar as well but when we visited the pool in July, it was late at night so it wasn't open. No biggie for us though -- bc we usually don't use pool bars anyway. The chairs around the pool are very nice with padded cushions. The folks working at the Radisson LBV are also super nice - from the check-in and in-house reservation folks to the bellmen and housekeepers. It seems to me that most folks there seem to want to do a good job and it shows. Everyone we have ever spoken with or have had contact with at the Radisson LBV has been courteous and customer service oriented. There are also numerous restaurants - both fast food and table service - that are convenient to the hotel. If you want to pick up a quick breakfast on your way to the park, you have several drive-thru options and all very close to the hotel. There are also a wide variety of table service restaurants in close proximity. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant so we cannot speak to its food or service. Many of the the restaurants are within walking distance as well if you don't want to get your car out. The only possible negative we see to this hotel is the traffic congestion in the area. With the hotel being situated near I-4, close to Downtown Disney, and as well as on 535 - a major thoroughfare, you WILL encounter traffic and congestion especially during the peak hours. We just took that into consideration when coming and going. The traffic seemed worse in July than this past weekend -- which would make sense though since summer is a more peak tourism time. Another traffic concern relates to 535 being a busy road and having are with a median, so you can only turn right out of the hotel when exiting it so you have to go and make a u-turn to get back to I-4. As well, if you are coming back from Downtown Disney, you have to go past the hotel, make a u-turn and come back to it. None of these are big issues for us but it is something to be considered. If you are in a hurry to get somewhere then you will need to leave extra time to accommodate for the traffic, congestion and road layout depending on which way you are headed coming and going. In close, the Radisson LBV is WONDERFUL! I would and have recommended it to my friends. I am VERY picky about the hotels my family and I stay in. But I have no hesitation with this hotel at all!

I initially chose another Radisson in Orlando, but changed my reservation when I found out they allowed smoking. I chose this hotel because the reservation agent assured me it was a non-smoking property, which is important to me as 1. I don't smoke and 2. I had my asthmatic son with me. Well, upon check-in, I realized that I had been lied to. There were people smoking all around the outdoor pool and at the only TWO entrances into the hotel. I went to the front desk and inquired as to why there was smoking allowed when this was supposed to be a non-smoking property. I was informed that this only means that there is no smoking allowed inside the building. I asked how I was supposed to bring my kids in and out of the hotel when the doors were the allowed smoking areas and not only did they have no answer for me, they were quite rude about the answer and did not seem the slightest bit concerned. We ended up staying the entire time there as I was not going to disrupt our plans to have to search for a new hotel. We even added on a night due to the extreme weather disrupting my plans to leave and when I went to add a night on, I encountered nothing but trouble. They wouldn't even honor the room rate I had locked in and I was charged almost DOUBLE for that last night.

The outdoor pool is simple, but neat and tidy, and it was a nice place to go and relax after overdosing on Disney. Breakfast was not included in the cost but, frankly, after being used to the costs of British hotels, I didn't have too much of an issue with paying the additional amount and the all-you-can eat breakfast buffet was excellent with a good selection of pastries, fruit and joghurts, pancakes, bacon, eggs, etc. I recommend the banana and nut pancakes which, unfortunately, I didn't discover until my last day. The hotel is situated on the east on the Disney parks and resorts but isn't too far away - just the right distance as far as we are concerned. It is right next to Interstate 4 which also makes it an easy hop to Universal and Seaworld, etc. It also sits next to the Crossroads area which has restaurants, bars and a supermarket (hotel rooms have a fridge and microwave if you don't want to dine out) and it is only the next block down that also has a Denny's, Burger King and Olive Garden (which became our favourite place to eat). These places are within easy walking distance. By the way, there is also an ATM at Crossroads which is also handy. All in all a nice hotel and we would definitely consider using it again whenever we next stay in Orlando.

While we could have checked in, the front desk was very courteous and told us they had a room available but they would rather not put us in it due to our long stay and the room being close to the elevator. They wanted to ensure our stay was pleasant. We agreed to come back in an hour or so as they recommended and took care of some other errands while we had the time.

Unfortunately, our stay was cut short due to some last minute change of plans. We ended up staying at another hotel in Florida that wasn't nearly as impressive.

On this information sheet, we were told strollers were not authorized on the shuttle. Call me crazy, but a great number of Disney World visitors have and bring their children to the parks! To not allow strollers is a bit absurd. Sure, strollers are available for rent at the Disney World parks, but as a parent it makes no sense to rent a stroller when I have my own.

Before booking the hotel, you should realize what the LBV area is like: Lots of other hotels. The Radisson LBV is right off the I-4 with access to downtown Disney in less than 10 minutes. With that being said, here are the pros, cons, and tips I can suggest from staying here: PROS - The hotel is clean and affordable: Almost unbelievable, but this hotel is both clean and cheap! We paid around $70/night for rooms during peak season. The bathrooms are clean, and the housekeeping staff kept the rooms fresh every night. The hotel also offers a pool (the pictures make it seem bigger than it is) and a small exercise room with one or two treadmills. The staff was friendly, helped out with every need, and were part of the reason our stay was almost magical! - Free shuttle to Disney: The hotel offers a shuttle to Disney. If this is your first time using a shuttle to Disney, realize that the bus route from hotels usually don't go directly to the parks. Shuttles stop at other hotels along the way, usually leaving the Radisson the 2nd or 3rd hotel out of 3 on the chain. Give yourself plenty of time to take the shuttle (at least a hour). The shuttles coming back from the park are usually full. Be sure to follow the hotel instructions and be at the stop 10 minutes before the bus is scheduled to leave. And don't worry... there is more than enough time to see the fireworks at Epcot and MK and get back to the bus.. even with the crowds! - Location: Although LBV is in the heart of a tourist area, the hotel is next to a ton of places to eat. If you walk 5 minutes from the hotel down Apopka Vineland Road, you can be at a McDonalds, Buffalo Wild Wings, Taco Bell, Pizzeria UNO, and a supermarket called \"Goodings\". There are a variety of other places in the shopping center behind the hotel (Perkins, Sony store, etc.). Make use of them! CONS: - Hotel Shuttle: Be aware that the shuttle does NOT leave the hotel after 12 noon. This isn't really a con, but be aware of the shuttle system. If you want to come back to the hotel, you might need to fork some cash for a taxi. TIPS: - Taxi: Taxi to the airport is around $60 (with tip) RT. - If you need to come back from Disney earlier than the scheduled shuttle times, take a taxi! HOWEVER, a taxi from MK or EPCOT will probably run you around $25 one-way. To save, take a Disney bus to downtown Disney (all transportation on Disney property is free). A taxi from Downtown Disney to the Radisson will run you less than $10 in peak hour. - If you feel you've ever been cheated by a taxi, make sure you note the taxi #! You can call the company and get re-reimbursed if you feel you weren't charged correctly! - Feel free to ask the front desk for an ethernet wire if you need one for your computer! They will definitely provide you with one! Overall, I feel that the Radisson was the best deal you can get outside of Disney properties with the greatest convenience possible! I would surely use this hotel again if I come back to the Orlando area!", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWell Worth the Money\u201d", "Author": "lbug0220", "ReviewID": "UR115766624", "Content": "After researching many hotels in the area, we believed Radisson gave us the best deal.

We chose this location because of the proximity to the pick up spot of the tour group we were using. We were pleasantly surprised with this hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean, comfortable and quite large. There were many restaurants in the area within walking distance. A staff member was available to give recommendations on places to eat and even gave coupons to places you thought you would enjoy. The hotel is also conveniently located to the Disney parks. It was only a 10 minute drive to Downtown Disney and each of the 4 parks. It only took about 15 mins to drive to Universal as well. The hotel does provide shuttle transportation for free to all of the parks, but we did not use that service so I cannot comment about it. The traffic of 535 can be horrendous in the evening as everyone leaves the parks and I'm surprised we did not end up getting rear-ended but it's to expect when so many people are visiting the parks. My only complaint for this hotel is regarding the sleep number beds. They did not stay at the selected number and during the night the opposite side of the bed became rock hard. We had 2 queen beds so we slept separately because we did not have enough time in our busy schedule to contact the desk and complain. However, as friendly and cooperative as they seemed, I'm sure the front desk would have been very helpful with this issue.

Upon entering the hotel lobby it was nothing spectacular but who cares when majority of the day will be spent in the parks. There's a tiny bar on the left side and their own restaurant. Fresh baked cookies reside next to the front desk which i thought was a nice touch for the kiddies or in my case a sugar addicted boyfriend. The room was clean and a good size; there was a love seat in the corner and a writing desk. The bed was big, clean and comfortable. The bathroom looked to be renovated recently but it could have been due to the well maintenance of the place. The shower was clean but the hotel skimped on the shower curtain, i found the water to spill onto the floor after i finished my shower. I appreciated the closet being a mirror since I find most hotels do not have a full length mirror. The hotel claims to have free wi-fi but its a gamble to log on and if you are successful its the slowest connection ever, but this was just a minor thing. Cleanliness and location are the most important things on my list, if i say something is clean it means its clean since I border on being too clean.

We rented a car so it was extremely quick and easy getting to the parks, outlets, nearby restaurants and 24 hour supermarket just next to the hotel.

The hotel uses cold white light bulbs which makes the lighting very white and cool, like a clinic, I think it would look more relaxing and cozy if they switch to the warm white light bulbs instead. We also followed comments made by another writer and searched for the gas station which sells discount park tickets. It was the 7 eleven gas station which is the third gas station after turning right from the hotel, actually; a block away. However, please be mindful you have to go to another hotel to pick up the tickets (about 15 min drive) and go through a 90 min time sharing seminar for the discount tickets.

Also, the bar staff were very welcoming and friendly and we enjoyed a few evenings chatting at the bar. The location was great for DTD and it was a lovely stroll to the Crossroads area. The issue of the hotel being on the busy road with no direct access when on the opposite side from the hotel did not pose us any problems whatsoever. You just travel a little further to were you can do a uturn. We never felt this was a problem at all. I certainly would not let that be issue to not booking at this hotel. I don't normally write reviews so am not really sure what else to say apart from our room was facing the road and we were never disturbed by noise from the traffic.

The Radisson LBV exceeds expectations on all fronts.

You can't beat the location either, if Disney is your thing, which I'm assuming it is. It's situated next to the Crossroads retail and dining complex on Apopka Vineland, as well as a 24 hr grocery store which came in extremely handy for our day trips to Disney and late night/early morning snackage in the hotel room. You can also walk to the Premium Outlets (bit of a hike, 20-25 minute walk), and it's a quick cab ride to and from Orlando International Airport, as well as the Mall at Millenia. Free, daily shuttles will get you to any of the Disney parks, and though they buses can get pretty crowded, the Radisson is the first stop so you're guaranteed a seat (bus stops at nearby Clarion property on its way to parks). The returning shuttle to the hotel from the parks leaves fairly late in evening, and if you wanted to return earlier in the day, if you're in even roughly decent shape, getting back to the hotel at night is a breeze. Simply take the unbelievably efficient Disney buses to Downtown Disney. From there, it's a leisurely fifteen minute walk down hotel row to Apopka Vineland, with the Radisson being just across the street.

Low rates can often mean you're getting a not-so-nice hotel room. There is no need to be wary of a deal at this hotel. It's a great rate for a nice hotel room. The beds are very comfortable. The room was spacious and we got a nice bag of goodies (including free samples, a bottle of water, snacks, etc.) when we first got to our room. I loved that. I also loved that there was a small refrigerator in the room. I did only give 4 out of 5 stars for cleanliness of room because there was a romance novel and something else left on the nightstand when we walked in, but that wasn't really a big deal. The room was clean. The location is very convenient as it is located right next to an entrance to I-4, and is about a 5 min drive to Downtown Disney. It is within walking distance (less than 5 minutes) to quite a few restaurant chains, including Pizzeria Uno, Taco Bell, McDonalds, Chevys, and several others. I found a great rate on Travelzoo, $88 total with taxes and that included $20 toward the restaurant which was excellent. We both enjoyed the breakfast buffet that had the most delicious fresh fruit.

The hotel is nicely appointed, and has classed itself up with service that is speedy and helpful, nice ammenities, and a location that offers a lot nearby. Hotel & Rooms: Very clean throughout! The lobby offers a restaurant (we did not try it), and a booth that offers all the tickets and information you need for your trip in the area, including Disney and Universal. Our room was clean and roomy. We had 2 queen Sleep Number beds, and a single sleeper sofa. It was quiet and comfortable. The only thing I can think of that was slightly negative was the bowl sink setup in the bathroom. It was very modern and nice, but the faucet did not reach out far enough into the bowl to make it easy to wash your hands or hair in the sink without sending water all over the countertop and mirror. Pool: Nice outdoor pool and hottub with a small cantina under the palm trees! No slides or kid-type 'toys' at the pool, but my teenagers both liked laying out in the nice poolside chairs for tanning. Location: The hotel sits on the northwest side of Apopka Vineland Rd and Interstate 4 right off the exit ramp. Across the street is the entrance into Disney World (a few blocks away from Downtown Disney). On the same side of Apopka Vineland Rd are a nice variety of restaraunts including Red Lobster, Waffle House, Taco Bell, McDonalds, Burger King, Fuddruckers, Perkins, UNO Pizza, Buffalo Wild Wings, and more. They are all within walking distance. There is also a nice small supermarket in the plaza just west of the hotel to stock up your minifridge in your room. Behind the plaza is a big minigolf facility if you'd like to enjoy an evening outing. We used the free shuttle bus in the morning of the first day to head to Universal Studios, but the time of pickup was not convenient for our family in the afternoon (they return from Universal around 6pm). We ended up just taking a taxi to various locations before our rental car was available. Also nearby are the Premium Outlets of Orlando. We went one afternoon and it was packed beyond belief! We decided not to do that again, although it was Easter time and the whole resort area was busy. (Side note: if you are coming by taxi from the western side of the hotel on Apopka Vineland Rd or from Downtown Disney, have your taxi drop you off at the Perkins just west of the hotel, otherwise they will spend an extra 5+ minutes driving east past the hotel to make a u-turn a couple of traffic lights up to get back to the hotel entrance. This will save you pretty pennies to get dropped off quicker without waiting through so many traffic lights and traffic to get to the u-turn.)

The beds were fantastic - the electric adjustments were great!! We were a little frustrated by the shuttle services to Disney World / Universal. This could be a better service (even if guests had to pay a small fee for the service). We did not eat the hotel bistro for breakfast or dinner, instead we ate breakfast at the Waffle House next door (which was great and somewhat of a novelty for us being from Australia). We also found the Uno Restaurant (100 metres down the road) to be excellent quality & value (and much cheaper than theme park options). The only criticism with the hotel are the 'catches' from the tour desk to try and get discount theme park tickets by attending a 90 minute sheraton resort time share seminar. This really frustrates us as you don't get that type of pressure in Australia when you are on holiday - it is something that we are simply not used to in Australia (I don't to get the hard sell when I am on holiday!!!!!!!!).

Theres a small fitness center/ a couple lobby computers for public use. NO RESORT fees,which are rip offs from other hotels and FREE Parking. Free shuttle pickups to the parks-didn't use. Mini fridge,worked great,coffee maker and microwave. Has a pool,but its very average at best.But we only used it once.Didn't have that much time for that. BEDS-sleep number beds,but they really didn't work very well.Never kept the right pressure. The bathrooms are abit small (tub too)-but adaquate. Nice large plasma TV.

Busses to and from the parks are few and far between. They were ALWAYS late and one never even showed up - we had to hitch a ride with another company! Other hotels in the area offer regular busses throughout the day. The Raddison offers one there (2 to Disneyworld park) and one back at night. That's it. Don't like those times? Tough. Also, we put out our breakfast menu on the door at 10pm two nights in a row. It was never collected so we didn't get breakfast each day. That's pretty lame. Finally, I realise it's a third party - but since it's located in your hotel lobby and not clearly marked as such, the concierge desk selling timeshare \"deals\" is appalling.

I am so happy I went with this option -- here's why: I really wanted to enjoy MK with my 4-year old (and my parents) and didn't want to be stuck in a Disney hotel where we paid for sub-par but expensive food. And though I have a child, I didn't want to be surrounded by children! That being said, I also really wanted to be as close as possible to MK. I was concerned about the drive there and back after reading some of the reviews on here b/c folks kept saying it was hard to get to/get out off, and I just have to share that I am a bit of a nervous driver and this was EASY. It's a regular road, not a highway. The hotel is well marked! You pull right out, and you are in MK within 8 minutes. We had literally parked our car in under 10 minutes from leaving the hotel. Next to the hotel, literally adjacent, are a bunch of chain-style restaurants, and they offered a nice selection since I really wanted to be at the MK most of the time, but this was a cheap way to eat breakfast rather than have to deal with a Disney hotel experience. The hotel was clean, pretty, rooms were lovely (we had a family suite, and for the price I would stay there again in a heartbeat). We ordered room service and the woman who brought us the food had messed up a little and left an item out. She took it off the bill and brought it to me anyway, her idea, I thought it was a nice touch on her part. I really can't say enough good things about this hotel if you want somewhere nice to stay VERY near MKingdom but don't want to deal with the Disney hotel. You will be happy and please know that it is really easy to get there! I was very concerned after reading reviews and was totally shocked to see how easy it was to get out of the hotel and back to it. As an aside, I had asked for a room away from the elevator and wasn't given it. Since I was in family suite, I heard the elevator all night.

This trip was for my son's athletic competition at Disney, so I decided to bring my daughter and her two small children along as well (afterall, we were at Disney!) I booked my room on Priceline and got an incredible deal, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a very spacious room with sleep-number beds, a pull-out couch (in a separate section of the room--which was very nice!), a small fridge, microwave, coffee--everything you'd expect to find at a higher-end priced hotel! This hotel is convenient to everything! A wide range of restaurants is located steps away. There's even a small restaurant in the parking lot, as well as a very nice, reasonably priced souvenir shop. Magic Kingdom is 4-5 miles from the hotel, keeping you close to all the parks, yet away from all the congested Disney traffic. Hotel parking is free (which is rare these days!) And, the hotel offers free shuttle service to/from all the Walt Disney World parks!!! The absolute best thing that I can say about this hotel is the housekeeping! Our room was literally a hot mess each day from the two small children and each evening when we'd get back--our room was not only cleaned beyond measure---it smelled fresh and clean too!!! I have never felt compelled to tip a maid for going above and beyond while staying at a hotel, but on my last day at this hotel, I waited for her and gave her a generous tip for going above and beyond my expectations! The only issue I had was getting the sleep-number bed adjusted to where it was comfortable for me. LOL. I had never experienced a sleep-number bed, so it was an adjustment--but once I found the setting that worked for me, the beds were very comfortable. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel to both the budget and higher-end traveler. I was able to get this hotel from Priceline Name Your Own Price for just $69 per night!!! QUITE A BARGAIN for the stay I experienced! If you're looking for an inexpensive Disney Hopper or 1-day ticket, turn right out of the hotel and go to the first gas station on the left (I believe it's a Marathon)---they sale Hopper tickets for a fraction of the cost Disney charges. You can get a 3-day hopper for around $150 (which is a steal!) Then, if you don't use all your days, this same gas station will buy the remaining day back from you. Don't BUY GAS here though--it's always priced way higher than the rest of the gas stations on down the road.", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Junction, CO", "Title": "\u201cThe Nicest and Cleanest Room We've Ever Stayed In\"\u201d", "Author": "shortandhat", "ReviewID": "UR101282795", "Content": "Much like many who stay in this area, we stayed at the Radisson because of its proximity to Disney and Universal Studios.

Check in was slow, and the lady working downstairs at the Disney ticket counter was difficult to follow (we ended up buying our tickets at Disney Quest in Downtown Disney). They don't have continental breakfast, which was disappointing. They DO have wifi.

After checking the TripAdvisor reviews and online prices, I booked 4 nights at the Radisson Lake Buena Vista. I was able to book two rooms for $79 each through a special offer at travelzoo.com. My daughter, son-in-law and 6 yr old granddaughter stayed in one room,. my husband and I in the other. There was plenty of room with a desk and sofa-bed, microwave, fridge, flat screen tv, nicely appointed bathroom. Very clean throughout. Being budget-minded, we used the free bus transportation to the Disney Parks with no problem. There are 2 morning trips to Disney, 1 to Universal and the same number of afternoon -evening return trips to the hotel. Depending on which Disney Park you want to visit, you may have to transfer to the Disney transportation which is fairly easy to negotiate. In the morning, the bus picked up at 1 more hotel, but none on return trips. Travel to the parks was less than a half hour. We did not want to rent a car, so we booked service through Murray Transport for $110 round-trip from the airport and for our return. The driver was waiting for us in the baggage area, loaded our bags into the large SUV. As previously agreed to, he made a supermarket stop where we shopped for beverages, snack and simple breakfast food. It was so nice not to fight the heavy traffic Other reviews have mentioned the loud highway noise. It honestly did not bother us in the least. We were in the room only for sleeping. However, we walked many miles at Disney every day and relaxed in the swimming pool and hot tub afterward. We collapsed into sleep easily. Light sleepers might need ear plugs. Several restaurants and shops are within walking distance. We used McDonalds, Waffle House and Olive Garden. We also saw Chevy's, Uno's and a chicken wing Place. We took a taxi to Downtown Disney for the Sunday character breakfast at the Hilton, cost $10 cab fare. From there we were able to take the Disney Bus to Epcot. The location of Radisson is great. The employees are friendly and helpful. Check-in was efficient. We used the complimentary computers in the lobby. Each evening, there are freshly-baked chocolate chip cookies to enjoy.

Overall, I agree. However, even great hotels can have their problems. First, the positive-as all of the reviews stated, the hotel was extremely clean, beautiful, and the service was top notch. All staff members were friendly and accomodating, and the hotel was nice and quiet...even at midnight on New Years Eve. The room service was prompt and delicious. The location was central to all attractions, and we had no problem getting to I-4 from the parking lot exit. The negative-we were looking forward to the sleep number beds. I'm not sure if we just got unlucky with our room, but both of ours seemed to be broken. The first night, we didn't sleep at all. The bed wouldn't stay inflated at the levels we put it on, and if my husband left the bed to use the restroom, I practically flew off the other side. It was rough. The next day we informed the front desk of the issue, but switched beds with our young child, as well. The other bed was definitely better, but far from the bed we had imagined based on reviews. Other minor issues...our internet didn't work in our room, even after maintenance came to attempt to fix the problem. I give the hotel credit-we received $10 off each night of our visit and apologies from the manager, but it was still inconvenient. Also, the shower water control would not stay in place. I either had to shower in cool/cold water, or if I placed the handle midway, it was loose and would fall to scalding levels. Again, something easily fixed, but still disappointing. I was considering not posting about the issues we had because this really is a great hotel. However, I value the honesty of the people who post on TripAdvisor, so I felt full disclosure best. I will say that my husband and I most value the cleanliness and quietness of a hotel, and the friendliness of the staff-and in these areas, we were not disappointed.

All amenities- ward robe closet, fridge, microwave,desk, table, bed stand, alarm, radio, LCD with all channels, big and clean bathroom and toilet. The housekeeping staff, employees and servers at the restaurant were polite, helpful and efficient. there was an ice dispenser on the floor with a vending machine.

There was not much in way of variety and we were there for 8 days so could do with some change. One could also order from some take-outs- some of them take a little long though. A little walk down the road are different restaurants and McDonalds. Downtown Disney is a comfortable walk from the hotel. The hotel has a free shuttle to and from the parks at select times. We could comfortably use it. Please familiarize yourself with the times and parking place as the parks esp Magic kingdom can be quite crowded returning home at night after the fireworks and if you dont have your own car. I would say in retrospect that hiring a car is cheaper and definitely easier in Orlando since the distances one has to travel are quite far comparatively and public transportation is not really an option.

The hotel is very conveinent and has plenty of parking. There are also lots of restaurants, some within walking distance (Chevy's Tex Mex, McDonalds, and others) and downtown Disney is just a 3 minute car ride away. Check in was a breeze, we had paid for the room with double queens but upon arrival I asked about upgrading to a family suite. The plus side to the suite is 2 queens in one room with and then an extra side room with a king bed, worked great when traveling with 2 kids. Both rooms had there own tv's but we didn't have much time for that. The only downside to the family suites is they seem to be only located near the elevators where the extra room occupies some extra space. From our bedroom we could hear the elevator at night but it wasn't a big deal for us because we have a white noise machine but I could see it bothering lite sleepers. The pool was nice, small with a jacuzzi off to the side and some comfortable lounge chairs. Great for the kids to swim after a long day. The restaurant was very good for breakfast with quick service and a nice buffet (I think it was $12 or so for the buffet) and the staff was willing to get you anything you wanted. We tried the restaurant for dinner one night and the service was very slow. We were all starving and the server was new and in training but things were taking forever. I had to get up to speak with the manager and also I went to the bar to get our drinks after they hadn't come 10 minutes after ordering. From then on the service picked up and the chef even came out to make sure our food was cooked to our satisfaction (pretty impressive considering the restaurant, it showed the chef cared alot about his food).

The location was extremely good as it was very close to Disney World and only a few minutes from Universal, they hotel offered complimentary shuttle service which was always on time! The rooms were standard, we had paid an extra few dollars per night for the King bed and didn't find it worth it. We had a view of the eye sore that is the neon building across the street that sells discount Disney merchandise. We're not really picky about views so that didn't matter but since we were also near the main street, we often heard cars crashing (seriously there was an accident every day on that road). The beds were comfortable enough you could select your softness or firmness, but it would get reset everyday. Great selection of tv channels, there were more channels than we could surf! Good for those rainy afternoons when we had to come back to the hotel early. I liked the fact they had a laundry room that was very convenient for long term stays. OH ONE REALLY BOTHERSOME THING is EVERY SINGLE DAY there are flyers for pizza places shoved under the door, everyday at least 3, I really hope the hotel will make some kind of effort to prevent this because not only is it annoying to pick them up and throw them away 7 days in a row but we ordered from one of the places and the food wasn't that great haha. I liked the toiletries, the bathroom (raised sink) and the room was clean. Like I said, overall good. There were lots of families at this hotel and fortunately the noise didn't travel through the rooms which was great news for both sides of the wall. The pool was average, a few chairs, a bar, a standard size swimming pool and a jacuzzi. The 2 computers they had available for internet and printing were quite handy, we used them a couple time to research food places and to print out tickets to Halloween Horror Nights. Also there's lots of great restaurants nearby that are walking distance, also a 24 hour grocery store which came in handy! You'd be surprised how many people shop at 11pm on a Sunday night.

It is not the most luxurious hotel in Orlando, but when you spend the entire day and part of the night sometimes in an amusement park, you want to get back to a clean, comfortable and affordable room.

The hotel is very close to Downtown Disney, and only a short drive to the other Disney parks, Sea World and Universal (10-15 minutes at most).

However, the hotel was quiet and clean and the staff that we encountered were all friendly.

The room was always cleaned well and everything that you could need in the room was available and working. The beds are an aquired taste I guess, but we both found them very comfortable.

I have stayed in many Hotels in the USA, and quite frankly for value for money this one is right up there with the best. We had two rooms on the sixth floor and I was extremely impressed with this hotel. We were made very welcome on arrival, despite a short power cut on our arrival (the whole street suffered a brief outage) we were dealt with very efficiently despite the computer system being down. The room cleaners were cheerful and always said hello. The cleanliness of the room was exemplary, fresh bed sheets and towels every day. My wife was impressed by their attention to detail, when arranging the toiletries etc. Admittedly we were not in a room closest to the lift shaft, but I find anyone complaining of the noise hard to fathom, as they seemed to be very quiet and smooth. As for the traffic and not being able to turn into the hotel when travelling South on the 535, all you do is travel under the the I4 flyover (do not attempt to turn before the flyover as this is illegal and very dangerous) keep left, there are two left turn lanes towards Vineland Ave. Keep in the furthest left lane an do a U turn at these lights (you will see the Golden Corral on your left). Pass back under the I4 flyover and turn into the hotel. Even in the busiest of traffic this is simple and very quick. I have stayed in locations in Florida that involved extended driving (60 mins is not unusual to some attractions) so a 3 or 4 minute detour is nothing to complain about. From the Radisson the entrance to Disney is less than 1 minute North down the 535. This gives quick and easy access to Down town Disney, then on to all the Parks. Make a U turn at the petrol garage opposite the Hotel and you can join the I4 East and West, from one slip road\u2013 also in less than 1 minute. Sea World and Universal are reached swiftly and easily. The Radisson Lake Buena Vista is an excellent choice for a value family hotel, and I would not hesitate to recommend it.", "Date": "August 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cExcellent price,,,exceptional stay!\u201d", "Author": "smfarre", "ReviewID": "UR74695430", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for six nights from July 4-10. Arriving on the 4th of July was not the smartest idea on our part, as the traffic was unbearable to even get down the street. We thought we really bombed in hotel location, but that was where our problems ended. The traffic was not bad any other day we stayed there. Yes the divided road was a little inconvenient, but we quickly adjusted and it was very easy to navigate throughout the rest of our trip. You can actually see the entrance to Disney World from the parking lot,,it was that close. The entrance quickly takes you to the Downtown Disney area. We loved everything about this hotel. We arrived a bit early, and the front desk did it's best to get us in quickly,,,,we arrived about 3 hours prior to check-in on July 4,,,a very busy day, and we still managed to get our room well before the official 3pm check-in. Our room was in a very quiet location on an upper floor. We had no problem with noise. The sleep number beds were nice. We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant about 4 of our 6 days there. We got the buffet each day. WELL WORTH it especially if you're heading to a Disney park for the day. There was always fresh fruit available and lots of it! The pineapple was amazing! Even though it is buffet style, they will make you made to order omelettes and pancakes to your liking. The food and beverage manager, Vijay Bhardwaj was out there just about every day we ate, asking us(and others dining) how their meals were. He took great pride in his work. He made us delicious onion omelettes with very light monteray jack cheese, and cooked it perfectly. He started noticing our order each AM, and would come out and say hello. The blueberry pancakes had fresh blueberries in them, not frozen or dried ones,,,,delicious! He even sold us to eat dinner there,,, and that was very good as well. It was also a very relaxing and peaceful place to eat breakfast. Although, we were there pretty early each morning! I am shocked by the comments about stealing in other reviews. Personally, both look like the same person. It also sounds like she misplaced it to begin with. Most thieves don't have the conscious to return it! Our experience with the housekeeping service was quite the opposite. They were very respectful not to disturb large suitcases or things that you clearly wanted there. One thing that impressed me was that on our first day of cleaning, our housekeeping person actually took the many products we had stacked on each side of the sink, and placed them neatly and orderly on towels, so they wouldn't get wet next to the sink. I thought that was above and beyond. We had quite a lot of things, and we really appreciated that. We also asked for extra towels on a note each night and she always had them available. The exercise room was a little tight, but had enough for who was there. The pool was perfect for the size of hotel that it was. It was never super crowded, and it too was very clean. The loungers were very comfortable. There were plenty of towels provided. The only thing that was annoying were the different establishments that would try to shove menus or advertisements into your door in the evenings. I was just about asleep one night, and then I heard someone shoving something in the door. I am sure the hotel does not promote this, as when I opened the door, the kid scampered down the steps before I could even say anything. If anything, the ads made me not want to go there! Every staff member I came into contact with was very respectful and did their best to make our stay enjoyable. I am returning to Orlando in October, and I will be booking soon. I will stay here again, without hesitation.

It's very close the Premium Outlets you can walk there or pay $8 to the taxi. Once after I got there, I used green buses to Prime outlets which also passed by Seaworld, and Universal Studios for only $1:) You can also make a negotiation with the taxis, they take you to Seaworld for $15, Universal Studios $25 and Prime Outlets $30. So I'd strongly recommend this hotel if u want to go to Disney Parks:) Besides that, the rooms are very spacious, I preferred the room that is far away from the elevators, so I didnot hear any noise, the beds are sleep number and very very comfortable. There are microwave, fridge in the room. What's more, the staff are very helpful however I dont recommend you to buy Disney tickets or any other tickets from the hotel if the season isnot very high.

The hotel is approx 300 yards from one of the main entry roads into the Disney Parks, so certainly on the doorstep for Disney. The hotel is on the junction of I4 and state road 535 (Apopka Vineland), however this is not apparent once inside (no road noise apparent from the room). I have only ever had a hire car in the states, so cannot comment on the shuttle bus services. Parking is readily available and free. The staff were always very courteous and helpful, the common areas of the hotel are very pleasant, the restaurant food was good (nothing special, but fairly tasty and well prepared) - and the bar is fine - especially the 'breakfast on the run' in the bar - a much lighter (and cheaper) option for brits who don't want to have to eat a whole plate of american sized breakfast before a day at the parks. Our room was very good, 2 Queen beds with good linens, a good spec (and very clean) bathroom. One slight moan (in our room - 701) - the shower curtain was too short and on a stupid curved pole, meaning every shower left the floor wet and slippery. Otherwise very impressed. The rooms have a decent fridge (not crammed with expensive 'minibar' stuff) which is very useful for cooling drinks and snacks etc. to take with you to the parks. The AC was a little noisy, but certainly very effective and it didn't keep me awake. We prepaid on the radisson website meaning this hotel cost us approx $75 per night for the whole family - an amazing deal for the quality of the hotel and service. Overall, for that money it is a no brainer and I would certainly stay again.

The sleep number bed is comfortable enough and an interesting hotel concept, but not close to the comfort of Westin Heavenly or Sofitel MyBed etc... It's just air! The hotel is new and that provides the major comfort... The rooms feature flat screen TV's but they are cheap and the speakers send out plastic sounding vibrations at the slightest hint of bass. Our TV ended up on an angle after vibrating itself to that position... For some reason many TV stations had no sound... The pre-programmed buttons on the phone did not work, nor did the drink vending machine or ice machine on our floor, but a short lift ride resolved that. Most unusual is that the hotel staff claimed the hotel have no international power adaptors. This is a first for me having stayed at hotels all over the world... As a result, a flat camera and many missed photo opportunities at Disney etc... Despite this, the hotel on this occasion was good value for the quality of sleep and modern comfort, so close to the Disney area, Outlet stores and many food options...

The location of the hotel is very convenient to Disney (not sure about the other parks because we only went to Disney). The only problem with the location is that traffic was terrible at 10 pm after the fireworks at Disney and it took a long time to get through the traffic lights. The hotel is located at an intersection, however you can not make a left hand turn into the parking lot. You have to continue on and make a u-turn further up the road.

No need to venture far for eating - Should you get fed-up of restaurants, (which we did on a couple of nights) there is a Publix and a Winn Dixie close by, where we bought food, to cook in the microwave in the room and then kept in the spacious fridge - also in the room. - should you like gadgets, then the sleep bed is good to play around with to change the firmness of the mattress.

The hotel is centrally located for most of the Orlando parks and also offers a daily free bus service to Disney. As for 'Temp4rebecca' saying you can only walk as far as a dirty gift shop - don't believe it. Yes, there is a 'cheap and nasty' gift shop next to the hotel, but explore a bit further and you can walk (within a mile radius - its healthy!) to many restaurants in the vicinity, including Carrabba's, Bahama Breeze, Olive Garden, Black Angus, Outback, Rio, etc. We walked to many places, including the premium outlet shopping centre, a beautiful chapel and a local supermarket, and had a great time. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful (some more than others), but a special mention is deserved for Terry the manager, the day time reception staff, and especially our room attendant (Room 419). The hotel does have some drawbacks: The location is not ideal, next to Interstate 4, and there is some difficulty accessing or leaving, depending on your destination/approach. We had to carry out U - turns on a couple of occasions, and subsequently got pulled over by the rudest of rude Orange County Sheriffs, for a 'misdemeanor' (no one in the hotel industry could surpass this 'lady' sheriff's attitude!). My fault, but boy, never mind the hotels, sort out your cops, Florida !! The air conditioning unit was efficient, but noisy and drafty when on, and did give us a few sleepless nights until we got used to it. We also have to agree with 'girltravel10' about the misleading situation at the Guest Services Desk - the desk is run by Orange Lake Resorts, and the guest service element is minimal. Orange Lake Resorts staff focus solely on trying to sell you time shares/villas on the pretext of giving you discounted park tickets. We avoided this desk after the second day - the staff were unhelpful and only interested in 'selling' (get rid of them, Radisson, they contribute very little to the customer experience). The above said, the majority of our comments are nevertheless very positive. We booked the Radisson for two weeks, but were then stranded when the Eyjafjallajkull volcano erupted in Iceland. The reception staff were more than helpful, and worked around reservations to book us in for a further 11 nights until the flight chaos subsided.

After reading the reviews, I made my reservation and was pleasantly surprised. My opinion is that this hotel is more geared to business travelers than families. There is no game room or other activities for kids. There is a workout room albeit a small one. The lobby itself has a sitting area with TV and there is a restaurant and a little bar type area as well. Overall the entrance area to the hotel is small compared to other hotels in downtown Disney area. I reserved a room which had two select comfort queen sized beds, a work desk and couch. The room also had a good sized HDTV as well as a fridge and microwave. The room was very clean and the bathroom was a good size. The room I had overlooked the souvenier store which is located in the same area. I didn't mind that at all. I didn't use the pool at all but it looked like a decent size. Even if I wanted to use it. The first day I was there it rained all day and the other 2 days it was a little cool for swimming. (Maybe not for some tourists from the north) The only complaint I have is not the fault of the hotel. You can only come into the hotel if you're heading west on Apopka-Vineland Rd from I-4. If you're coming from downtown disney you'd have to head east past the hotel, make a U-turn and head west just to get to the hotel. This became a problem around 5pm and beyond when people are heading from the parks or out to dinner. The traffic was so heavy it would take you a good 45 minutes to get to the hotel from Downtown Disney when it should only take you 5 minutes. My suggestion is if you're leaving the parks or downtown disney, jump on I-4 and get off at the SR 535 exit and head west. That way you'll be heading in the right direction.

We\u2019re regular value travelers doing the odd splurge; married, no kids; in our thirties. The Radisson is likely one the best value hotels you\u2019ll find for a trip to DisneyWorld because of the right combination of price, location, and useful complementary amenities. We lucked out and won this hotel stay via Priceline but would in future book this hotel directly to ensure we stayed here. Location The location of the hotel was excellent. We rented a car from the airport and were able to easily find our way to the hotel. It was a relatively short drive and the few tolls were not very expensive. There was lots of free parking at the hotel and we never were left without a spot even when we came back late. [Free parking was a big plus because the other properties we were looking at (eg. DT Disney Hilton, etc) charged crazy daily rates for parking.] There\u2019s easy access on and off Hwy 4. The only quirk is that because there\u2019s a median dividing N/S, if you want to travel south, the quickest way was to zip across the northbound lanes to a left turn bay (for the Chevron) and pull a U-turn. Beside the hotel is a low-end souvenir shop. [Didn\u2019t find anything good in there but you might as well visit it since it\u2019s right there.] Across the street is a Chevron. Do NOT buy gas here as it is way overpriced. North along the street for many blocks were A LOT of dining options both unique restaurants and more familiar chains. The only thing of note we found south of the hotel was a Walmart about 10mins away where we stocked up on water and foodstuff (way cheaper than the supermarket in the strip mall to the north). A short distance northeast is Premium Outlet. You can\u2019t access it via the highway and the side road to get to & from gets pretty congested. Across the street to the west is Disney property (keeping in mind that Disneyworld is essentially a campus upon itself). The Radisson is probably one of the closest hotels you can stay at without staying at a Disney resort or an affiliated property. We found access to all the key Disney locations was quick (at least during early December). The highway (versus navigating thru the streets on the campus) seemed quickest the quickest route for us to get to and back from whichever theme park we were visiting that day. To get to Downtown Disney, there\u2019s a \u201cside street\u201d entrance north of the hotel. Additionally, some previous reviews complain about the difficult routing to get back to the hotel from Disney (because of the median). Coming back via the highway, it is not an issue. If you come back via the Downtown Disney side street route, you just need to head south 2mins to the left turn you would take to go Premium and do a U-turn. We drove out to the Universal area to go to Prime Outlet. Although it wasn\u2019t too bad of a trek (along the highway but the return on International drive was pretty slow), I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d recommend staying here if you were going to spend a lot of time at Universal. Apart from the nearby strip mall, walking to nearby locations probably isn't the best way to spend your time. We were thinking about walking to Premium but that would have been a LONG walk and not very pedestrian friendly. Service We found service fine. No check-in line when we arrived mid day on a Saturday. The front desk people didn\u2019t seem overly friendly but were efficient. Maid service was fine too. Nothing memorable which is a good thing. Room We asked and got a room facing away from the highway based on some other reviews complaining about car noise. Noise didn\u2019t end up being a factor for us. View was ok. Overall, the room was clean and modern looking. Lots of space for the two of us as there was also a sitting area and a desk. Our room had two queen sleep number beds. You can actually feel the change in stiffness but I still think it\u2019s gimmicky. However, my wife, who\u2019s quick to complain about a bad bed didn\u2019t complain. There was a mini-fridge and microwave in the room which we used for liquids, snacks, and breakfast food we picked up from Walmart. Again, we found this to be a big plus for the Radisson. There was also free Internet access in the room; my last big plus for the room since so many other hotels charge for it. The wireless was a bit spotty but the wired connection was solid. The only complaint I had about the room was the bathroom sink. The way it\u2019s designed, you can\u2019t help but splash water everywhere. There's also a safe but kind of small. Miscellaneous The hotel has a free shuttle to the Disney parks but the schedule was pretty limited. If the schedule was more frequent, we would have considered ditching the car rental and just roamed locally apart from a taxi trip to Premium. Having a car ended up being pretty handy (even though we ended up paying for parking at Disney) and driving was pretty easy. We didn\u2019t end up eating at the hotel restaurant but there seemed to be some decent daily specials. There\u2019s a decent sized pool area with hot tub outside which we didn\u2019t use. I don\u2019t recall anyone using the pool but we were usually out most of the day. You can hear quite a bit of street noise. There\u2019s an onsite car rental but we didn\u2019t check out the rates.", "Date": "March 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay, lots to do\u201d", "Author": "Asanya", "ReviewID": "UR58398715", "Content": "My family decided to stay here for our recent trip to Epcot.

I was there for 3days and 3nights and every service was outstanding, with employees who actually seemed like they appreciated thier jobs and liked to help their customers. I was given acitivity infomation that were located around the hotel and they even had the knowledge of other stores and entertainment in their area. Being located across the street from Disney is what helped me make the decision to book my summer vacation here in one of ther suites.

After reading a bunch of reviews I booked the hotel at a price of $90 per night. I have stayed on Disney's premises on at least 7 different occasions at their moderate to luxury hotels. If you can afford $300+ per night, they are usually a very fun place to stay, although the convenience to the parks depends on the hotel and the parks you are visiting. This hotel is directly off Interstate 4's Lake Buena Vista exit. One of the four nights we had horrible traffic on that exit. We left the Magic Kingdom at around 7 pm and I think some of the other parks were closing at that time. Also, there is a Bahama Breeze and some other very popular restaurants directly off the exit ramp. We tried to get into Bahama Breeze and left due to a one hour plus wait. I requested a room away from the elevator after reading the hotel could be a bit noisy. The person at the hotel desk blocked out a room for me in advance. I found our room to be very quiet. My kids were making the most noise. Rooms are a good size, modern and pretty clean. Same goes for the bathroom. The beds were comfortable and overall we had a nice stay. The room has a flat screen tv and a good sized fridge. Not a mini fridge. Also includes a microwave. The pool is small by Orlando standards but we didn't go in it. Being from Miami, we don't go swimming after September and before June so that was not a consideration. I had read some reviews about outstanding management and the like. I had no interaction with them except for the room request and check in. Didn't find anyone to be particularily friendly. They did their job and that's it. However, we had breakfast one morning at the hotel and did have a very enthusiastic waiter who was extremely eager to give us Disney tips. Overall, if you don't want to stay in a low-end hotel, and don't want to spend your retirement money on a week's vacation, I would recommend the Radisson.

I normally stay at the Omni Championsgate but they were booked so I took a chance on this hotel based on the reviews I read. I must say that I was quite impressed with the hotel decor. It was far nicer than I had anticipated. The food is standard so don't expect anything spectacular. For people who are rewards members, don't expect extra points, a free welcome adult beverage or anything of that sort. You will get a welcome letter in your room with a cookie and a pamphlet that instructs you to go to the tour desk for a coupon book. Beware, the coupon book is their attempt to sign you up for a timeshare presentation so unless you want to give up a couple of hours of your time to hear a sales pitch and tour a different property, it will not be of benefit. I began my stay on the 7th floor across from the elevators and I don't recommend this to anyone who is a light sleeper, as the elevator shaft is extremely loud and will keep you awake at night. I was moved twice within three days (712 and then 808) and finally landed in room 817 (nice upgraded room) but it is located behind the elevator shaft and directly below the elevator engine (?), which was even worse (noise wise) so make sure you ask for something far away from the elevator (lower numbers on lower floors..300, 400, 500, 600) because I was told (at checkout) that the lower the floor the better the acoustics from the elevator. Also, make sure you reiterate your request to be away from the elevators when you check in or they will ignore your initiatial preferences on your member notes. I spoke with the manager on the last day of my stay and she assured me that I would receive some of my points back for my inconvenience (still waiting on them) but I suspect they will post to my account soon. Radisson has a satisfaction guarantee so if you are unhappy with any part of your stay, they claim that you won't pay for it so hopefully the amount of points I receive will cover all three nights that I stayed there or at least one night of my three night stay. I didn't get a chance to use the pool because it was entirely too cold but it is small and decent with a hot tub. The gym is small but sufficient. The bar is small but sufficient with drink specials daily and the restaurant was a decent size with decent food. Parking is free and there was sufficient room to park each night.

The rooms were very quiet for the most part, although we did hear a truck picking up trash on a couple of mornings about 5:30 AM.

But Disney is like the size of Manhattan and the hotel is not close or within walking distance of the part of DIsney that you'd be likely to visit---it's pretty close to Downtown Disney, true, but not close to the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, the water parks or Animal Kingdom. I've run marathons and would not have been able to walk to any part of the park not involving shopping, much less a child or when making the return trip. The shuttles were not adequate either. In reading a manager's response to another view, I gather that they now have added a shuttle (still not adequate in my opinion). At the time, they had 2 shuttles to Epcot and 1 shuttle to the Magic Kingdom (none to any other part of the park). The one to the Magic Kingdom left at about 10:30 and returned 12 hours later. Really? The Magic Kingdom is geared to families with small children. Are they really going to spend 12 hours at the park without a break or let little kids stay up past 10:30 at night? Keep in mind that there was a note on the shuttle schedule indicated that the schedule was not exact and that you should show up early and expect the possibility that the shuttle might run a little late. So a 10:30 p.m. shuttle might not show up until 10:45 or 10:50 (but people should be there waiting at 10:10 or 10:15) and might not deposit you back at the hotel until closer to 11 or 11:15. I imagine the manager's response will indicate that they have added a shuttle or that you can take a shuttle to Epcot and then use Disney transportation to get to another park. Adding another shuttle would not really provide an adequate amount of service to make it easy to get back and forth to the part (it would still leave huge gaps in the day where you were stranded there) and taking a shuttle to another park and then using a bus or monorail to get somewhere else ends up meaning a hour long commute either way. As I said, I would have loved this hotel if it were located anywhere else. I would have liked this hotel a lot better if it was more straightforward in its description of its location and use of shuttles.", "Date": "January 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Hotel I have stayed at for Business\u201d", "Author": "ranndella", "ReviewID": "UR53846593", "Content": "I must say, I am usually worried about the types of places my company will allow me to stay on business.

Spacious, microwave, refridgerator, comfortable beds, very clean and nice tv, good channels. I tried to get a drink from the vending machine and it wouldn't take my dollar, so room service brought me a soda free of charge for my hassle.

This was our family's first ever vacation to WDW and I was happy to find this hotel at such an affordable rate and the reviews on TripAdvisor were so very positive. After staying here, we were spoiled rotten and were sorely disappointed in the Port Orleans Riverside resort that we spent the remainder of our vacation in. If I had it to do-over, I would spend our entire vacation at the Radisson. We booked through Priceline, but unlike every other hotel we've booked through Priceline, we were still treated like first class customers. We were given a 5th floor room away from the elevators with 2 queen beds and a pull out sofa for our family of five. The beds are sleep number beds with elegant 'Martha Stewart' ish decor, incredibly comfy linens, and the room is just really well appointed and lovely. This was so much more than I expected for the price we paid. This room on Disney property would easily be $400 a night or more. The room included a small fridge and microwave and coffee maker, flatscreen wall mounted TV with cable, etc. We saw no bugs at all, the AC worked very well, and there was no noticeable noise in our room from other travelers or the elevators. The view was across the highway and at night we enjoyed the 'neon horizon' of Orlando. Some people may not like that type of view, but for us it was lovely. Lisa, from the desk downstairs, seemed to always be at work and always had a fantastic smile and personality. Our train arrived at 10:30 am, well before their check in time, yet she had our room ready for us with a smile. We had thought we would have to wait a few hours but nope, she had us in our room within minutes with a smile. And we were SO happy to relax and spend the day by the pool. Actually, the pool is my only \"Con\" for this review - its a lovely pool, very clean, and they have a hot tub. But it may well be the ONLY unheated pool in all of Orlando. My boys had really looked forward to swimming but in early November they simply couldn't spend more than a few minutes in there before running to the hot tub area. Their onsite bar and restaurant were both great and we had excellent service. One night my son dropped a glass and it broke - the staff immediately moved us to a completely new table, with a understanding and a smile - we were made to feel like family by every single person we encountered at this hotel. My next happy surprise was that they have a taxi service that they've apparently contracted with to provide service to Disney at $10 each way. I loved that I didnt have to guess or wonder. Even if someone could say \"You could get the same trip for $8\" - I was far happier knowing, in advance, exactly how much the trip would be for our family of FIVE. The taxi operator even happily placed a car seat in so that my 4 year old felt safe and happy. He provided his card for us and when we were ready to leave, he picked us up right at the entrance, where we were (we didnt have to walk all the way back to where he dropped us off), and had the car seat ready to go - with a great smile, and again, making us feel like welcome family. If I had any question or request, Lisa was always happy and courteous with a response. I was never made to feel like a bother and I always felt like she wanted me to be comfortable and happy with our experience. And I was! I cannot say enough about how great it felt to stay at this hotel. No, there is no 'resort landscaping' like at POR, but I happily traded that for the more than excellent decor and comfort INSIDE where it counted!! Who wants to walk a mile to get to your restaurant? We took the elevators downstairs and were immediately seated with no crowds. Since we used the taxi service, we never had any trouble with getting in to or out of the hotel from the highway. It was simply taken care of. A far better experience than the on site Disney busses we dealt with the remainder of our stay - and even with the cost of the taxi, this hotel was far cheaper than our on site hotel! There is free, if slow, wifi and a nice fitness center downstairs. There is a tiki bar/snack place next to the pool in addition to the bar inside the lobby near the restaurant. Maid service was fantastic. I loved coming back to my room to find everything clean and tidy, but also they had taken the time to lay out a small hand towel in the bathroom and carefully arrange our personal things out instead of all jumbled up in a corner as I had left them. It felt like having a personal butler. Again, if I return to Disney, I will stay HERE without a second thought! Far cheaper than onsite Disney and far and away NICER!!

We were intrigued to see what such an affordable hotel had done to deserve such high praise! It was certainly easy to find, taking I-4 from the airport took only 20 minutes. Check-in was excellent, on the basis of the feedback on Trip Advisor we asked for a room situated away from the elevators and they were only too happy to oblige (I bet they get that a lot nowadays!). The room itself was of a very good standard, with 2 queen beds which you could adjust the firmness of the mattress on. Every amenity was present - Plasma screen TV, seating area, fridge, safe, iron & ironing board, microwave and even a hairdryer (my wife was very pleased with the last one). The bathroom was clean and well presented, although it was slightly on the small side and getting in & out the shower was made awkward by the presence of the loo right next to it! Overall though this didn't present too much of a problem. Probably the biggest bug-bare with the room would be the air conditioning. The unit was exceptionally noisy, and if you had it set on auto to keep the room at a constant temperature, you would undoubtedly be woken during the night. There was occasional noise at night from other guests, but nothing too serious. Our room was on the opposite side of the building to I-4 so I can't comment about noise from the traffic. One other concern was with wi-fi access. I couldn't connect via my mac despite the network being visible and using the passwords provided (I see other reviewers have had the same issue). There are two PCs in the reception that are free to use (they have a printer connected too), but again web connectivity fluctuated. So maybe not a concern for everyone, but for any Facebook or Trip Advisor addicts out there, it's something to bear in mind. Obviously we didn't spend too much time in the hotel itself, as Orlando has plenty to offer! And here is where the major problem with this place makes itself apparent - although its location is fantastic in terms of proximity to both Universal and the Disney Parks, getting out of the facility is next to impossible at busy times as traffic backs up from a nearby junction. If you are heading to Universal or International Drive, or Disney via I-4, you'll need to make an immediate U-turn after joining the traffic, and if it's busy this will be prevented by stationary cars. Getting into the hotel can also be a pain, and completely impossible if you're approaching from the North on S. Apopka, or the East on I-4. In either of those instances you will be forced to go past the hotel and make U-turns on busy junctions - time it wrong and hit red lights and this can add 10 minutes to your journey time, frustrating when you are so near the hotel (and yet so far). So that probably sounds very negative, and it's true that access in and out did prove frustrating. However if you're getting out and about and avoiding the heavier periods, you'll have no problem once you've figured out which direction to approach from. In summary I would say that we were largely very pleased with our stay and we would have no hesitancy in returning. Based on what we paid this was a fantastic bargain, and being so close to all the major Orlando attractions was an added bonus. Access in and out was the only real concern we had, but after a day or so we figured it out and got our directions of approach sorted - I'm sure you'll do the same!", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cWould Highly Recommend\u201d", "Author": "upgraydme", "ReviewID": "UR49382529", "Content": "Stayed at the Radisson for 3 nights in early November after reading the recommendations here and am glad I did. Rooms are very clean and spacious in comparison to many hotels. Brilliant location just off the highway and near the attractions but not noisy. Also there's an abundance of places to eat within a 5 min drive or walk and every cuisine you can think of. I read the comments about noise from the elevator keeping people awake so when checking in requested a room as far away as possible (which is always a minimal distance but enough that you're not disturbed when sleeping) Rooms beginning 401, 501 etc are furthest away. Enjoyed the pool and hot tub each day and had both to ourselves for the duration. Only have a couple of gripes. Constant jazz music plays over the speakers by the pool and it becomes tiresome after a while. More contemporary music would've been welcome. Also, if you're not a big breakfast person and looking for something light then you're better off going elsewhere. I paid $1.60 for a banana which seemed a ridiculous price. Coffee is way overpriced too. Paid $2.80 for a coffee at the bar. The Waffle House (open 24 hrs) is across the car park from the hotel so would suggest people nip over there for a coffee. Also some of the staff are inexperienced, unhelpful and provided minimal assistance when asked where the nearest bank was or why the internet wasn't working. Overall though I loved my stay and this hotel did exceed my expectations. Remember to pick up your free freshly baked cookies from the reception area every afternoon. They are delicious, especially if you put them in the fridge for a while or heat them in the microwave!

Guys and gals, I have stayed in hotels like Sheraton in San Diego (31/2 star), Rosen Shingle creek, Orlando ( 4 star) as a part of the same vacation and I bet experience at Radisson was far more better than any of these places. In my view comfort is more than any name or star rate of the hotel. A 4 star hotel is no good if you have to take 15 minutes to take your wallet out and start putting in numbers to get internet and if you have to swipe in and swipe out ur card everytime u park ur car. I would rather prefer hotels putting in their final price including everything( as Radisson did) than surprising me with hidde charges and tons of discomfort. Finally, this place was closest to Disney, ok form Universal( if u have a car--5-10 minutes drive, Wet n wild 5-10 min, Seaworld-5- 10 min, Aquatica- 5-10 min), walkable form Orlando premium outlets mall, less than 5 min drive from lake Buena vista outlet factory, nearest walmart is less than 5min ( in case if u prefer having some milk, cereal, some fast foods form oven).

I booked the hotel here only on the suggestion of being the #1 choice for the area on Trip Advisor and for no other reason other than relying on the trust of previous travelers. This hotel sits on a paved lot across froma a rather gaudy looking privately owned sourvenir and gift shop that kind of detracts from the ambience of the place when you first pull into the lot, but that is one of the few negatives for the location. We traveled from Orlando Intenational Airport by Mears shuttle and had no vehicle to get around in. The hotel offers free shuttles (sans gratuity) from Platinum shuttle services which leaves at three or four times in the morning and then returns on three different schedules in the early evening commencing at 5:20p.m. until 10:15p.m. from two different Disney parks. The draw back to this is that once you go, you must stay until the evening in order to catch a shuttle back. There is no back and forth going unless you want to foot the bill for a taxi and even though a look at the map of the area implies that you could walk from park to park or from the Radisson to Disney Downtown, trust me...you can't. DisneyWorld holds property to over 10,000 acres (according to a Disney shuttle driver) and the parks are several miles apart. I would guess the distance from the Radisson to Epcot to be about 7 miles or so. If you wanted to foot this bill by taxi everyday my guess would be around $30 coming and going, so the shuttle with a two or three dollar tip is a real bargain. The shuttle was on time everyday and they don't wait more than a minute for stragglers as they go from the Raddisson to the Sheraton as the next stop before heading to the park, so don't be late. One suggestion I might make here is that if you plan on using the shuttle to DisneyWorld you should upgrade to the Park Hopper ticket option as the shuttle picks up the earliest from Epcot and you are going to get real familiar with this park. Without the Park Hopper option you are going to get to sit outside for lengthy periods on a bench just waiting for the shuttle. Better to be inside watching the fireworks or something. We arrived early the first day but the front desk held our bags safely for us while we went to the park, nothing was amiss on retrival. The hotel itself was very clean, as was or room. We had double queen beds with the advertised Sleep number bed, but it will only adjust firmness and not positions if that is what you are looking for. We both slept well every night of the stay. You may opt out of daily sheet changes by a supplied card to help conserve water and energy if you choose to do so. Our room was on the 7th floor and was quiet on each night. As it is outside the park area there were not any loud children in the hotel navigating the hallways in the early hours. There was plenty of hot water for showering on each day and evening. The only negatives we had about the place was that, while it advertises free wireless, I couldn't pull it up on my notebook suffiecent enough to surf. A call to the front desk responded in the free use of a three foot ethernet cable, (there is a connection in each room), but that also failed to pull up sufficent mbs for use. However in the morning the ethernet cable pulled up just fine...still no help on the wireless though. Secondly, the 35 inch LCD televison was of a brand name that I had never heard of ...\"Chemei\" or something like that and on the first day it politely froze up in place. I reached behind it on the wall and pulled the power plug and reinserted it and it came back on. This is the first time that I had ever had to \"reboot\" a television. However it was a recurring problem on a almost daily basis so my guess is that particular model of televion is actually a memory link up to the main feed so that they can turn off all the sets in unoccupied rooms from the downstairs desk. That's just a guess though. The biggest plus for this hotel to me was the area. Although it does not appear luxurious from the outside lot it sits right next to a shopping center which is within lighted walking distance at night and has many restaurants: TGIF Fridays, Pizzaria Uno, Johnny;s Steakhouse, and a half dozen fast food places like Burger King and McDonalds. The Olive Garden and Black Angus Restaurants are just a short walk past the shopping center on the same side of the road. Although we returned from the park to late to patronize them on most nights it was comforting to know they were available within walking distance. (The food in the parks is very expensive in comparison and hit and miss as to quality as with any other theme park.) Conversly directly across from the Radisson is the Hyatt which sits on maybe twenty or thirty acres of private landscaped land that looks like a private jungle. Very pretty during the day and looks quite luxurious, but at night I looked at it and wondered to myself if anyone without a car would feel safe walking through two acres of private dimly lit trails to get to the Black Angus Restuarant across the street. Orlando is not a gated community and has its share of violent crime as attested to on the television each night so travelers beware and be safe. Also the Mears driver pointed out to us numerous gators laying in the ditches next to the freeway coming in from the airport. It seems that they live around these parts. No thanks....I will forgo the ambience for the paved parking lot sitting next to the paved shopping center. The Radisson also has a restuarant which sports a breakfast buffet for those on the run, but if you opt for it be sure to ask for your eggs to order. They are included in the buffet price but for some reason almost always forget to mention it. All in all this was a great choice for a first Orlando visit.

The office door was open, but both the clerk and the manager had their backs to it, which faces out to the registration desk. I finally had to call out to them to get their attention. I was then given probably the worst room in the hotel, room 206, just above the hotel entrance. There are horribly bright fluorescent lights on either side of the window, and the curtains cannot be closed well enough to keep all the light out. As a consequence, the room is extremely bright, which doesn't make for good sleeping. Things would soon prove even more annoying. Having arrived at midnight, I decided to splurge and get room service breakfast. I put out the order card at 1 a.m. The card says it will be picked up if out by 2. Imagine my surprise when no breakfast came at the requested time the next morning. I checked the door, and lo and behold, the card had not been picked up. I called room service, and was told, \"That's housekeeping's fault.\" Not, \"I'm sorry, sir, how can we make it up to you?\" I ordered breakfast, and when it arrived, the bill was approximately double what it should have been. ($28 instead of $16.) Luckily I caught it, but how many people would have missed that? What a terrible first 10 hours here. I have two other complaints. First, and very important for anyone planning to work while here (or just surf), this hotel has the absolute worst internet connection I have experienced since the days of dial-up. Are they kidding? The wireless connection is fine, but the connection from the hotel to the outside world is up only about half the time. It will work for a while, and you click a link, and it goes off into la-la land and never loads the page. It will then stay off, and at some random time start working again. It can drive you crazy if you're trying to, say, chat, or use Skype, or download/upload files. The other complaint is that housekeeping failed to clean my room in a timely manner on my second day here. I left for my meeting at 7:30 a.m., came back around 3:30, and to my surprise found the room untouched. The housekeeper was next door, and seemed taken aback that I would want the room cleaned. It was as if she thought the Do Not Disturb sign had been out, but it wasn't. Her reaction was very peculiar, and it was hard to communicate to her that I just wanted fresh towels and to be done with it. All in all, a huge disappointment. Maybe if I hadn't been given the worst room in the place, maybe if the internet had worked, maybe if they hadn't botched up my breakfast order and bill, maybe if they had been welcoming at reception...maybe then I would give this place a good review. But I can't. All I can say is, stay away. There are tons of hotels around here and I would bet that most of them offer much better service. And now I'm going to post it, if I'm lucky enough to have a working internet...", "Date": "October 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Florida", "Title": "\u201cAccident Waiting to Happen-Deceptive\u201d", "Author": "Coolest_Mom_101", "ReviewID": "UR47837208", "Content": "We usually stay at the Hyatt but it was fully booked. The description for this hotel online said best \"new\" hotel, even in our AAA book it was described as being newly constructed leading you to believe you were staying at a new hotel. The outside is deceiving-the facade of the hotel is new but we discovered later on that this used to be a Days Inn. The parking is free (one plus) but limited. We had a double stroller and two infants and had to park in the back on the second night unaware that there were steps in the back-no handicap access or stroller access, no ramp, just steps. We had to wheel the stroller all the way around to the front of the hotel which seems like a million miles when you have two kids that are exhausted after Disney all day. All the while, tripping on poorly installed pavers. They installed brick pavers that are not flush to the ground and loose, there is only one low area to wheel a stroller in the front of the hotel and they installed some kind of speed bump over it. The curbs are all pavers and square and it all blends in-major trip hazard. I saw countless people trip on the rug outside the front entrance as well. The lobby seems nice but small and so are the elevators. The ceilings are low and the hallways are narrow. We had a room with two double beds with the pull out couch and we had a crib. You barely have enough room to push the stroller into the room. The space from the edge of the bed to the dresser was so limited-the wheels on the stroller were getting caught on the furniture. The furnishings were a low budget imitation of what contemporary luxury hotels would offer. The dresser drawers were small, broken and falling out when you opened it, the sleep number beds were hard and uncomfortable. If you have small children with you, make sure you adjust the beds when you first get there becuause it makes a loud noise when you adjust it and my three year old was scared of it. The flat screen tv was a plus along with the small fridge and microwave and the bedding was nice. The bathroom was the worst part of the room. When you first peek in there you see the sink-looks good-granite countertop with the bowl sink that sits on top. But turn it on and its a whole other story. The faucet doesn't reach the sink and the water goes out the back of the sink when you wash your hands. The ball on the handle popped off and if you arent careful, you could scald yourself with the extremely hot water. Then there's the tub/shower. I knew this wasn't a new hotel when I saw the shower surround. They installed beige lanolium that someone cut into squares and glued to the existing tile walls. Where they attempted to grout in between, there was mold and mildew and old caulking that was beige against a white tub. I don't think I have ever seen lanolium flooring used on a shower/tub surround-especially in a hotel. This wasn't lanolium tiles-someone cut it. I felt like I was in a shower in a trailer park. It just didn't go. Someone cut major corners to revamp this hotel and it just wasn't sanitary. Not to mention the big black hair I found under the toilet seat when we got there. After you shower, when the mirror is steamy you can see the glue behind the mirror where they glued it to the wall. Just so low budget. The entrance to the room has a marble floor divider that is a trip hazard and they tiled over the existing tile in the bathroom so you stub your toe when you walk into the bathroom because it is slightly raised. This is when it occurred to us that this was a refurb hotel. We confirmed from an employee after they reluctantly told us that it used to be a Days Inn. In addition, the doors slam shut and it's so loud that it wakes you whenever your neighbors open and close their doors. We actually ate at the breakfast buffet on our last day in the hotel restaurant. The price was $11+ each adult, kids were free. They left the lids on the warming trays and it was a scald hazard for the average person holding a plate in one hand to have to lift these heavy metal lids with hot condensation dripping and there were no place to sit the lids while you are serving yourself. There were limited choices for breakfast-eggs, cold waffles (not homemade), grits, biscuits, sausage, bacon, two kinds of fruit and pastries. I went to take a pastry and then I realized that there were flying insects swarming them. Little bugs just flying and landing on it-all over it. Now I know why they left the lids on everything. It's unlimted Starbucks coffee-they bring you a caraffe that is the size of one small mug. It was rediculous...lol. The server Brian was the nicest person in the whole hotel and he did go out of his way-he made an average over priced breakfast bearable. The property that the hotel sits on is too close to the main road and you have to go down and make u-turns to get in and out. We had to drive almost ten minutes or more out of our way to just get back to the hotel. There is a median that separates the road and no way in unless you make u-turns. The only restaurant that you can easily access is the one in the hotel. Otherwise it's an annoying drive of u-turns and traffic. We gave up and ordered a pizza from one of the many solicitors they allow to put flyers under your door. They delivered it but you had to go down to the lobby to go get it and we had to pay for delivery. So why did they ask what room number we were in if we had to go down to get it? Needless to say we will be staying at a resort hotel next time-you get what you pay for. Actually in this case we paid too much for mediocre surroundings. Not family friendly, especially if you have small children or need handicap access.

This company (Orange Lake Resort, check out their complaints on line) will offer you discounted tickets to the theme parks, for listing to their timeshare presentation.

DO NOT BUY ANYTHING OFF THEM, by doing so you agree to time share sales presentations etc. Use them for information on parks etc, but they can't do tickets at anything cheaper than buying on the door of the theme park, the only reduced priced tickets they offer are if you take part in a time share presentation. We got dooped into cheap Disney World tickets by the rep called Rob who LIED about what we had to do to get them. Giving false information to obtain money is fraud yet that's exactly what he did. Don't even get involved with them. Horrible experience. However, we explained to the hotel what the problem was and they swiftly dealt with the issue and got us a full refund.

Awesome place!\u201d", "Author": "DixieGirlIl", "ReviewID": "UR45621052", "Content": "I chose this hotel based on it's reviews on this website and it did not steer me wrong. This place was AWESOME! New and clean, clean, clean! And I'm a clean freak! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I had read two of the (very few) bad reviews about this hotel on this site, one from a person complaining that they were wrongfully charged a cleaning fee for smoking in the room (if they truly didn't smoke in the room, I feel bad for them, but if they did they deserve the fee), and another from a person whose room was near the elevator. I could sympathize with the person stuck near the elevator since the same situation, different hotel had recently happened to me. I explained while making the reservation that I have terrible allergies and asthma, and that I could not be put in a room that had EVER been smoked in or I would get really sick, and that I'd had a bad situation with being in a room near the elevator. They were more than happy to make sure that we were put in a room that had never been charged for a cleaning fee for unlawful smoking since the hotel is all smoke free, and they put us as far from the elevator as possible. Also, when we arrived they asked if I had problems with down comforters, and with my asthma, I do, and promptly removed them from our room and replaced them with cotton blankets before we even got up to the room. It was the most pleasant hotel stay I've ever had. It was so quiet. Beautifully decorated. The rooms were huge! The bathroom was not huge, but big enough that my husband and I could both fit in while bathing our young sons. This may sound strange, but the elevators smelled good. We've stayed in places before that were clean, but the elevators smelled bad. Not here, they smelled good, but not an overpowering scent (thankfully for my allergies). If I had to find one problem the only thing that I could find would be the complimentary shuttle service to the Disney parks. It was VERY limited timewise and it just didn't work for us, so we had to drive to the parks and pay for parking. But, you can't have it all. I would much rather stay at the Raddison and pay for parking instead of staying at an over-priced not near as nice place on Disney property just for free shuttle service!", "Date": "October 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Beach", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel, great location, excellent price!\u201d", "Author": "smlukas", "ReviewID": "UR45526114", "Content": "This hotel is excellent, without spending a ton of money.

The rooms are big and the beds are kingsize. There was also a sofa and desk in a separate area of the room. Bathroom was clean and modern. Ice machine and drinks machine by the lifts on each floor. The corridors were clean and spacious. The buffet breakfast was really nice and the staff so friendly. You do pay more than inner Orlando but you're getting a better quality. They also do Starbucks coffee in the lobby. The hotel is right opposite the start of the Disney parks. They have shuttles to the parks, although we didn't use them. Restaurants next door within walking distance, we like Uno for all round value. Red Lobster is also really nice but a little more expensive. My one crticism is that when we arrived, we were told that we could have a free park ticket and were directed to the desk to find out how we got this. The guy on the desk was actually from Holiday Inn resorts. He said that to get the park ticket we would just need to go to this other hotel and have breakfast and listen to a 90 minute presentation on the hotel. This is a complete lie. It is a one-to-one hard sell of a timeshare. The breakfast was a few mini donuts and muffins with awaful coffee. Although the lady who did the pitch was very nice and the resort is lovely, we didn't know we were going there to be sold a time-share. It ended up that we were there for 3 hours!! So we'd wasted half a day of park time. We got a free universal ticket, so saved $130 but we didn't get a full day at the park. If you do this, make sure you cut them off early. They will send 3 people out with all sorts of sales tactics. Just don't show even a slight bit of interest, unless you genuinely are. There is the usual crap of the deal only being available on that day, rubbish! We are not stupid, and were not expecting to get anything for free, but we did question the guy on the desk at the hotel why they wanted to know our income and what we had to go to the hotel for. He said that they are just trying to promote a 5 star resort. A complete lie. They wasted our day and lied to us. Just don't get sucked in.

Based on the good reviews I decided to stay in this hotel for 8 days. The hotel is conveniently located on the Apopka Vineland Rd (SR535) which is right next to the 4 interstate. When leaving the hotel just make a small U-turn and your on your way to all the theme parks. The view from the room isn't that great, because on one side of the hotel you have the interstate and on the other side you have a bunch of power lines. On the 6th floor we didn't hear any noise from the 4 interstate. The hotel has enough (free) parking space so that shouldn't be a problem (although September isn't a really busy month). There are some good restaurants close to the hotel and a Walgreens. You can have breakfast, lunch or dinner in the hotel. If you're going to the parks, I would advise you to eat there for better value. They offer free internet (both wired and wireless), I found the connection terrible, you have constant timeouts when browsing the internet (I mainly used the wired connection). One thing I found very annoying: the pizza flyers. Everyday when you come back to your room you'll notice 3 or 4 pizza flyers on the floor. Even the room key is one big pizza commercial. That's just annoying, a bigger issue for me was the bedding: the SleepNumber beds. With a small remote you can decide how firm you'd like your bed to be. This sounds like a nice feature, but for some reason you have to re-set your bed to the right number every day and I found a normal bed to be more comfortable (and believe me as a nerd I tried a lot of settings). Also the airco unit was kinda loud, and our last day it gave of a bit of burning smell. The bathroom was great, nice high shower, although I didn't like the wash bowl which makes it very easy to spill water allover the place.

Hotel appears to be only about one year old and everything is in exceptional condition. Hotel parking is free and there is no resort fee (most other Orlando hotels spring a $5 to $15 per day or more fee on top of you upon check-in to use \"services\" that should be in the base price, and some charge parking fees, so be careful, but thank you Radisson for not charging such fees!). Check-in was prompt on a busy Saturday night and they provided a quiet room opposite the highway as I had requested (you should request the same). Enjoyed the sleep number beds, nice linens, and decent towels. Lobby is upscale and beautiful and it is a huge plus that elevators are right inside the door from parking at the back of the hotel, so you don't have to run through a maze to get to your room. Room ceiling height is probably closer to 9 feet (I prefer a foot higher) and beds are a little cramped in the room, but our room had separate loveseat and desk by the window, which was a nice place to sit while reading, dressing, or eating breakfast in the room. It is also nice that beds were queen sized rather than doubles. Refrigerator in the room was a plus and was large enough to store half gallon of milk, half gallon of orange juice, and many water bottles, soda cans and beer. Last guest left our hotel safe locked, and only a manager could unlock it, so couldn't use safe until second afternoon of our stay, but it was not a big deal and front desk staff let us know this when we reported it right after check-in. Housekeeping was great, always left lots of towels, and they even made a swan out of a towel in the bathroom, which the kids thought was cute. We left a tip for them and we don't usually tip maid service. Hotel has chocolate chip cookies on the right side of the check in desk from about 4 to 8 p.m., so be sure to pick some up. The pool bartender overheard me asking where the cookies were at 3 p.m. one of the first days we were there, and the front desk people said they would soon put them out; we headed out to the pool and the bartender brought them out to us, which was a nice an unexpected surprise! Pool chaise lounges are thick and very comfortable. It is hard to tell from the pictures, but pool is very large and we had no problem getting loungers. Designers put most poolside landscaping outside of poolside patio areas (rather than inside the fence) which is a shame, because the pool could have looked more tropical and lush had they put more of the palms and plants on the inside of the fence; property should add more planters inside the fence to compensate. Thanks to the previous Trip Advisor reviewers who warned us avoid the time share counter, aka \"concierge.\" The front desk people instruct you to go over there as part of the check-in; we ignored that step and were happier for it. Also note: we booked directly through the hotel (which has a fairly liberal cancellation policy), and when their rates dropped about a week before our trip, we called and they adjusted our reservation to honor their new lower rates, which was awesome. Disney tips: Hotel's shuttle service is limited so rent a car to get around, which will save you much frustration (although you will pay $12 a day to park at the Disney parks). Costco website had coupons with best prices. Purchase a couple of $1 disposable ponchos for each person to keep one daily in pocket for quick thunderstorms. Sunscreen your face in hotel room and spray on neck and shoulders in hotel parking lot (to avoid being on display in Disney parking lots). Arrive at parks half hour before opening, can ride 2-3 rides per hour first two hours, then lines slow down a lot; have each person carry half liter bottled water each to parks (and purchase water bottle clip for $6 to clip to belt) and refill for free at drinking fountains in parks. Get copy of all showtimes at front of park as you go in (so you don't hike to far-off land only to learn next show isn't for an hour or that EPCOT world showcase isn't open until 10 or 11 a.m. Stop touring between 1 and 2 p.m. and each lunch outside parks (best bets include Sweet Tomatoes and Fuddruckers at Crossroads Plaza just north of hotel; Lonestar Steakhouse is just south of it about a block past 1-4 and has wonderful Salmon and great burgers and inexpensive side salads; Bahama Breeze is near the Lonestar and has good food, but entrees come with no sides, so you have to pay a lot extra for side salads, etc.). Take naps from 3-5 p.m.; if you return to parks at night, count on only doing secondary rides as best ride lines will be more than an hour and fast passes will be gone for the day. Muppets 3D at Hollywood Studios is ultra outdated and boring so skip it; Philharmagic 3-D movie at Magic Kingdom is 10X better than any of their other 3D movies, so do not miss it.

A couple of things I will comment on... ok the u-turns on 535 can be a bit of a pain but this is Orlando folks just about EVERYTHING you do in this town is a bit of a pain. I didnt find this too irritating. The time share desk... OK... I dont get it... Radisson Hotel pimping Holiday Inn time share... I didnt get any calls during our 7 day stay but did get run down in the parking lot on checkout. Typical timeshare deal though... spend 1/2 your day and get a discount on the hotel and tickets on a return trip so if this is your sort of thing then by all means go for it. We did not utilize the pool or food services on the grounds so I cannot comment. As for the sleep number beds well you either love them or hate them... I liked the wife did not... The internet was as most have described (spotty) I used both wireless and LAN. Now on to my biggest disappointment. The rooms are great BUT the windows and walls are paper thin. I could hear the elevator brakes from my room (about 6 rooms from the elevator) which got very aggrevating over 7 days. You can definately hear the traffic outside (or some sort of noise) no matter what room you stay in (we stayed in 515 backside away from I4). Sirens, garbage trucks, jackhammer, leaf blowers we heard every bit of them. Worked like a 6am wakeup call daily. The AC unit also sounds like a loud vacuum when it shuts off. If I had only stayed here one or two nights it would have been ok but over 7 days I got really tired of it. So overall I rated this hotel average though I can see where some would rate it 5-star. When I return in December this will not be my hotel of choice. With some minor insulation and an upgrade to the windows this hotel would rate one of the best in Orlando.

The reason we chose this hotel was because of the location & the excellent rate, i think we payed around $79. The hotel is situated opposite the entrance gate to disney & is very convenient for lake buena vista shops & restaurants. The hotel is quite new. We stayed at this hotel for a total of 4 nights over 2 seperate stays. The first stay we were put on the 8th floor facing lake buena vista (this is the best side to be on as on the opposite side there is the highway & not much of a view). We were very impressed with our room & liked the decor. There are large lcd tv's on the wall although they are cheap ones & we had problems with our signal on more than one occasion. I have read other reviews that mention the noise from the elevators/lifts & i can confirm that we were able to hear them too even though our room was at least 4 doors down the hall from the elevators so there is not much sound proofing going on in this building. I got the impression that even though this hotel looks good it was built quickly & cheaply. The mattresses are quite good as you can choose your own settings for firmness. Regarding internet they let us use the computer in their back office which was very helpful but not very private. Can't comment on the pool as we didn't use it but it looked ok. After our first 2 night stay we checked out to go & rent a villa in Kissimmee for a week. On our return we were warmly greeted again (the staff are very nice & friendly) & checked-in very quickly. We asked for the same room as we had stayed in before but it was unavailable so we were put in the room next door (even further down the hall but we could still hear the whoosh of the elevators!) however we soon found out the tv wasn't working properly, the toilet seat was broken & there was a strange stain near the bed which looked very dodgy. I called downstairs to inform the front desk & they apologised & moved us across the hall to the room opposite (overlooking the highway, noisy & boring view). Unbelievably the tv wasn't working in this room either & they had to send a guy up to fix it. When i complained, again, we were given $10 off the room & a couple of vouchers for a free starter at the restaurant (which we didn't bother to use). Overall the hotel is in a convenient location albeit a noisy one& is good value but i cannot believe it is #1 on Tripadvisor for Orlando.

Chalk it up to watching too many Dateline stories :) - THIS hotel is 100% the exception. The most important item to me and my family when we travel is how clean our space is. HANDS DOWN, this was the cleanest hotel we have ever stayed in. We are in our mid 30's and both travel heavily for work and we travel on extended trips 3-4 times per year with our daughter. The maid service was incredible. I can not recall the name of the maid that served our room the entire week we were there but she was incredible. Very sweet and each day said good morning to us and always wished us a good day at the parks. In the mid afternoon when we came back to \"refresh\" and hang by the pool she always spoke to our 6 year old and asked her what her favorite part of the day was?! That was an added extra customer service feel. Checking in was a breeze, the reception area was super friendly. At one point during our stay my room key stopped working, luckily the maid was in the hallway and allowed us in the room because she knew us (another benefit to speaking with the customers, that created an awesome customer experience for us because we were all very tired and had a very grouchy 6 year old on our hands - if the maid wouldn't have known who we were, I am positive she would not have let us in) the guy at the front desk took the time to explain that if I had a blackberry or one of the more recent phones, not to put my key near it because often times the phone will deactivate the card - who know? I certainly didn't, but he took the time to tell me that and I didn't have that issue again. The pool was really nice, noisy during the day bc of street traffic but unless you are paying several hundred dollars to be at a secluded resort, you are going to have that. Next on my list is the price - we usually rent a house when we come to Orlando but recently had a bad experience so decided to try this hotel - NEVER again will I get a house - leaving a messy room and returning to a nice clean room has its perks and because of the price, staff and value we WILL be back - we already have our October reservation and our reservation in April 2010.

We had a family suite. Although the proximity to the main I4 was a little worrying we could not hear any noise form it while in the room. Check in was very quick and painless and the staff were incredibly helpful. The room was clean and reasonably spacious, the only problem was that for the family suite there is only one bathroom which housed not only the wash basin and bath/shower unit but the toilet as well. Now as I am sure you can imagine when 6 people wake up at the same time and all try to get ready to leave together having only 1 bathroom was a bit of a problem, for this reason I would only recommend the family suite for families with younger children. The beds had been raved about by quite a few reviews but I have to say that very few of us had a comfortable night with the 'sleep number beds', it was like sleeping on an air bed that changed setting nightly, normal sprung mattress with a topper would have been preferable. My husband came home not being able to stand straight. Unfortunately the family suites are next to the lifts and so you can hear them working throughout the day and night. The housekeeping staff were very efficient and the room was always very clean with nice new towels replaced daily. The only problem was that they kept altering the room temperature, where we would set it to around 72 F but we would always come back and it would be lower. This was the worst when we came back at 9pm one night it being still over 90 F outside to find the room temperature at 60 F, it was like walking into an ice box. The pool was more than adequate and was very rarely crowded. The loungers and chairs by the pool had great thick cushions and the pool towels were great and fluffy. Because of the closeness of 2 major roads there was a few times when the noise didn't make for a very relaxing time. The pool bar was open daily from midday. We had only one major problem and that was a fire alarm and midnight, the guests dutifully evacuated via the stairs and congregated in the car park and not one member of staff came to tell us what was going on. Some guests went back into the hotel and were told that it as a false alarm so everyone went back to their rooms. NOT ONCE did a member of staff inform guests what was happening or make sure that everyone was ok. I did mention this fact at check out and they refunded that night cost which was great but not sure whether the staff had really been trained as in how to deal with an emergency like that. All in all we had a relaxing time and the location of the hotel was great with easy access to main routes.

I was hesitant at stay at a hotel because we are use to the size of the timeshares (2 bedrooms, living room, 2 baths etc). But since we knew we were going to be at the parks we decided what the heck. We had passed the Radisson almost every day and from the outside it is nothing special. We got to the Radisson on 06/18 and stay until 06/20. We were able to secure a family room. We were SO thrilled with this hotel. The staff from beginning to end was awesome. We encountered Lisa at the front desk and she was awesome in helping up secure the only available room in the hotel. The lobby and lobby restroom were very nice. My kids ran over and picked up the cookies right away. It ended up lightening and we had to come back early from the park. We ended up having dinner at the hotel both nights we stayed. The restaurant food was awesome. The servers were pleasant and the chef came out and spoke to each person in our party both days. The next day we ordered coffee at the bar before heading out to Typhoon Lagoon. We called it an early day and came back to the hotel because we were enjoying ithe hotel so much. The kids ran and got cookies again. We went to the pool, ate dinner in the bar area and order some drinks after the kids settled in for the night and spent some time with their older sister.

The elevators were gorgeous and throughout our entire stay we never had to wait for the elevators like in other hotels we've stayed at. The rooms were wonderful. The sleep number beds were great and the flat screen tv was excellent. My mother has a back problem and throughout our entire stay she never complained about her back. I guess we need to get her a sleep number bed. The microwave and refrigerator were big pluses for us. They had free wireless internet which could have been better. I loved the bathroom and the bowl sink. Each day, we got back to a spotless room. They also refilled on their amazing toiletries. I loved the oatmeal soap they provided. They also left small bottles of hand sanitizer which we loved. We used the pool one time and it was nice. Their lounge chairs by the pool were extremely comfortable. The hotel also had chocolate chip cookies available in the lobby which were delicious. I have no complaints about this hotel, no wonder it's rated number one here on Trip Advisor.

Walk if you can to the restaurants and be patient when pulling in and out - it is easiest to just go down to the lights and pull into a business or do a U-turn.

We only encountered a few minor problems. - We asked the timeshare lady to call us a taxi to Downtown Disney, she did, and she told us it would be there in about 10 minutes, almost an hour later we were still waiting, after complaining 3 times we decided to just walk and she didn't even care or apologize. - One of the elevators broke down on 3 different days during our 6 day stay. This caused for 20 minute long lines, so we decided to take the stairs for the most part. The stairs lead outside though, which is a bit annoying, since you have to walk halfway around the hotel to get to the reception. The only thing we that didn't work too well for us was the location, we didn't rent a car, and we went to Orlando mainly to visit Walt Disney World. We went to Downtown Disney practically every day, which is about a 20/30 minute walk (depending on how fast or slow you walk), which isn't too bad, it's a nice walk. But it got rather cold during our stay, so walking back late at night when it was freezing cold was a bit of a let down for us. This isn't anything the hotel could do anything about though, but it's just a warning to people who aren't planning on renting a car and are visiting Orlando mainly to go to Walt Disney World. The walk to Downtown Disney is do-able, but most likely quite hard with small children or older people, and not very pleasant when it's either cold or very hot. One solution would be taking a taxi, but this can add up to quite a large amount of money when you do this on a daily basis. We did love the shuttle to Epcot, it went to Epcot 3 times throughout the morning and went back to the hotel 3 times at night. It was always on time and never crowded, which was great. From Epcot you can go everywhere on Walt Disney World property, however, when you want to go back to the hotel during the day or go to the parks in the afternoon or at night you'll have to either take a taxi or take Disney Transportation from Downtown Disney, since the shuttle only runs a few times a day. All in all, we loved the hotel and would definately recommend it to others!", "Date": "April 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cFresh, warm, appointed, freindly, professional, convenient, outstanding\u201d", "Author": "Bigcityracing", "ReviewID": "UR28474788", "Content": "We stayed at the property for one night and enjoyed everything about it.

The hotel is right off of I-4 at exit #68 (Hwy 535/Apopka Vineland). It's a great hotel in a good, central location. The hotel was built within the past 2 years so everything is brand new. Plenty of parking, nice marble and granite d\u00e9cor. Great pool and hot tub with very comfortable lounge chairs. The pool isn't heated so the water was a bit cold for a swim when I was there last week. The fitness center has top of the line treadmills, elliptical and weight machine. Staff was very friendly and helpful. There is a rental car office on the hotel property. Rooms are a good size and feature the Select Comfort Sleep Number bed. There is a sitting area with an oversize chair that folds out to an extra bed and a desk that are both separate from the sleeping area. All rooms have a microwave and mini fridge and a big digital TV with lots of channels. Bathroom is a bit small, but it's nice. The hotel restaurant is good and prices are on par with nearby restaurants. The breakfast at the hotel ended up being much cheaper for us than going out to the Perkins or Waffle House down the street. The Radisson offers a free shuttle to Disney but only to Epcot. You then have to use Disney transport (monorail or bus) to get to the other parks. We found it was easier and more convenient to drive to Magic Kingdom and Epcot and pay $12 for parking vs. being dependent on the hotel shuttle. It was only a 10 minute drive to the Disney parks. You can also get a taxi for about $10. There are 30+ of restaurants within walking/driving distance. Pirates Cove (mini golf) is just down the street and is a nice way to spend time before or after dinner. There is also a Publix supermarket nearby to stock up on beverages, snacks and fresh fruit. There is a SuperTarget about 10 minutes away and it's also a good place to get groceries and get some cheap Disney souvenirs, water toys, toiletries, ponchos, etc. Overall, a good value for a very nice hotel. I would stay here again. P.S. Don't forget to bring a roll of quarters with you for all of the Florida toll roads. PROS - New property, very clean with beautiful d\u00e9cor. - Less than a 10 minute drive to Disney Parks and about 2 minutes to Downtown Disney. - More of a business/convention clientele, so it\u2019s not overrun with children. - Plenty of restaurants, shopping and drug stores nearby. - There is a FedEx Kinko's down the street. - The front desk puts out fresh chocolate chip cookies every afternoon that are perfect for an afternoon sugar fix. CONS - The hotel is right off of I-4 and some rooms face the highway. There can be quite a bit of traffic noise at night. If you're a light sleeper like I am, you can counteract the noise by running the AC fan. Your best bet is just to get a room on the other side of the hotel. - No wireless internet except in the hotel lobby. LAN connection in the room was spotty at times. I had to change rooms because the connection in my room didn\u2019t work consistently. - Vessel sink in the bathroom isn\u2019t practical. The faucet is not positioned correctly and the water splashes all over the counter since it can\u2019t reach the bowl. We had to have a towel permanently around the faucet to prevent a mess. - The Business Center is just 2 computers and printer next to the front desk.

The Bathroom - ok so maybe I didn't have a separate shower stall and the bathroom wasn't clad in marble and the use of florescent lighting meant i looked grim (reality check anyone?) in the mornings...

One of the beds was big enough for me and 2 others if I had been so inclined... Room was well lit, great for working and having a large flat screen TV and an iPod dock suited me fine. FREE internet was excellent! 3. Location. erm ok... I came for a conference being held at the Mariott (resorts world?) and it was a 5min drive away.

I was a bit surprised when we pulled up in front of it.. it didn't look that impressing. I read all the reviews & it had gotten very good ones. When we walked inside.. it was very nice.. not huge but nice. It used to be a different hotel prior, but Raddison remodeled the inside anyway. Our room was on the 3rd flr... and it faced the north so we didnt hear the hwy noise from I-4. The beds were very comfortable we though.. (we had 2 queens), the bathoom was a tad tiny. the sink was that wierd bowl thing.. shower worked well..black marble floor was a bit strange. The A/C worked well.. controllable by temperature & not real noisey. Flat screen TV that was ok.. but we werent there to watch TV. The restaurant we only had breakfast there 2x.. it was pretty good- buffett $9.95 a person... Although.. we ate their 2 days in a row.. & were charged 2 different prices for the same thing. Not a big difference ($2) but still strange. (I think the first time the guy didnt charge for the orange juice my husband had. The hotel is located very close to Disney if that is what you are planning to do.. right outside the back entrance to Disney Marketplace. Plenty of parking. The only complaint we had (and it was really no big deal) was that there was no lemonade in any of the vending machines on any of the floors. I recieved a survey from Radisson about our stay.. I did mention that & as I said it wasnt a big deal.. my husband wanted to keep something in the fridge in case he got thirsty at night... we ended up picking something up while we were out. The sent back a reply to my survey & said they were very sorry for the inconvenience.. they contacted whoever the supplier was to come more often & they gave us another free night. for the inconvenience. I found everyone that worked there very nice & helpful... we would stay there again if we were in the area for any reason. Dining Tip: If you get a chance check out Fulton Crab House. I thought at first it might be owned by Disney.. but it isnt. The food is excellent (Mahi Mahi) The Calamari.. the best we ever had anywhere. Portions are big.

We had booked the standard room with two queen size beds. We were both impressed by the amenities upon arrival. In room microwave, refrigerator, and the Sleep Number beds. We both slept terribly the first night, the bed was extremely uncomfortable. We kept trying different adjustments but it always resulted in one of us waking up with back pain a short time later. To make matters worse, the in room refrigerator kept turning on and was very loud - loud enough to awaken both of us. The hotel has a pool and spa, so we thought we would use that. It was pretty cool outside, low 60's - the pool is not heated and the water was really cold. We wanted to use the spa, the water was barely luke warm and the jets would not turn on. We complained at the front desk and they a said they would contact maintenance, we didn't hear from them again. We spent one more night in the quuen size room, trying the second bed to see if it was any better. We complained about the beds and asked for a room with a standard bed. We were told that the Sleep Number beds were are only choice but we could upgrade to a king size and that might be more comfortable. We went for the upgrade, we were surprised that they did not offer this gratis and that they charged us for the upgrade, especially considering that it was just for one night. The king size room has a jacuzzi tub and nice walk in shower. It seemed much nicer than the queen size room, That night we realized what a mistake the upgrade was. The noise from the adjacent freeway was so loud we both had difffculty sleeping. The larger king Sleep Number bed proved to be just as uncomfortable as the queen. At checkout I complained about the beds again. We both had terribly stiff backs after our stay there. On a more positive note, the restaurant was excellent. The staff was super friendly, and we both really enjoyed the two meals that we had there. The chef came out to ask us how our dinner was, exceptionally friendly.

We stayed 4 nights at beginning of our 10 day trip to Florida and again on the final night of our holiday (after doing a few days away while we toured around Southern Florida). Hotel simply fitted our needs perfectly. Room was super clean, modern, all furnishings were of the highest quality and the comfort in the beds was just fantastic. There were only two of us (myself and my girlfriend) but even if we had kids, you could easily sleep them in the room too, as there were two double beds along with a small foldout sofa. The optional breakfast we thought was fine, although they do need to brush up on their tea making skills. Front desk staff, in fact all staff were generally quite courteous and very helpful. Hotel is also in a great location for visiting the nearby theme parks, Disney being just across the road, with SeaWorld and Universal not being that far away either. But a car is a must really for getting around. Nearby there's a big outlet center too where you can bag cheap designer items at knock down prices. Right next door there are plenty of places to eat along with a 24 hour supermarket, but don't shop there, it's ridiculously expensive. Better off going to the nearest Publix or Walmart which are both within 2 miles. We paid $495 in total for 4 nights at beginning but this doesn't include breakfast which adds around $12 per person per day. Re the noise that some people mentioned because of being close to I-4, we had rooms on both sides of the building and didn't have any problem sleeping. So overall not bad at all. Would we go back???

Having lived in Florida I return at least a couple of times a year but this was to be my first solo trip in many years. I chose this hotel as it was within walking distance of Downtown Disney ( I do like to walk and took about 20 minutes or so), Radisson is a well known brand and it was easily accessible for my friends picking me up.. The hotel has been completely refurbished; it didn't look that great previously as I remember passing it years ago and they have done a fantastic job. The public areas are spotless and apart from one member of staff (there is always one!) the staff were very friendly and polite. The room was HUGE, with two beds, flat screen TV, fridge etc.and was always refresehed and perfectly cleaned on my return. The hotel itself was very quiet to be honest so there was no noise or wild pool parties! I didn't see a fellow guest on my floor throughout my stay. I didn't find a problem with noise from i-4 and I am a light sleeper. However if this might be a problem best to ask for a room facing the car park at the back. I took the hotel shuttle to Disney a couple of times and they were great. Very punctual and got you to EPCOT within 10 minutes. Previously when we stayed at Crowne Plaza Universal they only had 2 shuttles back but here there were 3 here and at at much better times. I returned Animal Kingdom using Disney transport one day and it took me over 2 hours to get back to Downtown Disney! As you no doubt know The USA is the land of the car and not public transport! Right next door is The Crossroads shopping centre. It has a great 24 hour supermarket and lots of places to drink and be refreshed. TGI's was my favourite (forget The inferior UK version) This was a great place to relax with one of their fantastic moijitos. It's an easier stagger home! If there were any niggles it was the internet connection could be a bit hit or miss; wouldn't normally bother me but as I was by myself and relying on my laptop to keep in touch with those back home it could be frustrating when it was off for hours.But as I say just a small niggle.

First, the positives. The rate - without doubt this hotel is good value. It is after all a 4-star and I wasn't aware of any competing hotel in the area that offered such value. Secondly, the rooms - spacious, well-appointed with microwave and fridge. Thirdly, the beds - the sleep number beds allow each side of the bed to be independently inflated/deflated to your own personal comfort level. These work really well. We hadn't experienced them before and I now think all hotels should have them! Now for the downsides. First and foremost, the location. When booking the hotel I knew approximately where it was and that it was convenient for the theme parks but I hadn't appreciated its exact location. Just take a look at my photo to see the view you get. The hotel is literally adjacent to the I4 interstate highway nestling between the exit road and another 6-lane highway and the noise insulation in the hotel is just not good enough. Needless to say we slept pretty poorly while we were there. Second, the breakfasts are truly awful. Unfortunately, we had pre-booked b&b so ended up eating there each morning. On three out of the four days we eat from the buffet which was extremely poor so on the last day we ordered omelettes from the menu - after a 30 miinute wait they arrived and were honestly the worst omelettes I've ever had in my life. Third, the general service from the reception desk was truly under-whelming, there are no doormen/porters and no-one offered to help us with our bags. Fourth, a minor irritation. The concierge desk we discovered is manned by staff who are not employed by Radisson but work for a variety of Florida resorts. On our first day we approached the desk hoping to get some accurate impartial advice about the theme parks, opening times, best mode of transport etc. but what we got was a thinly-veiled sales pitch trying to entice us to book a trip to their vacation resort the following morning in exchange for discounted theme park tickets. We declined and didn't go near them again. So all in all I personally wouldn't stay at the Radisson again because of the intrusive traffic noise and the service not matching my expectations of a four-star hotel. However I guess you get what you pay for and if you're on a budget, this hotel may be for you. If you do stay there, a couple of tips. 1. Book a standard room. We booked a king bed room for our first visit. Only on checking out did we discover that all of the Radisson's king bed rooms are at the front of the hotel nearest to the I4 exit road. So for our second visit (which we'd already pre-booked) we downgraded to a standard room and chose one at the back of the hotel. The advantages of that were reduced traffic noise (but still very noticeable) and a slightly lower rate. The room is the same size but contains two queen beds and only one bedside table. 2. Don't pre-book breakfast. What you get when you arrive is a $20 breakfast voucher for each day of your stay (though I had to ask the receptionist for them). Much better to walk round the corner and get a decent breakfast from one of the local restaurants.", "Date": "February 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "bayou18", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable hotel.\u201d", "Author": "bayou18", "ReviewID": "UR24189156", "Content": "I chose this hotel for a two night stay for my mother and myself.

There is a very nice restaurant in the hotel where we ate both a breakfast and a lunch - both were great meals. There is an Olive Garden and Red Lobster within a short walking distance and a Joe's Crab Shack in close proximity. The hotel offered shuttle service to and from Epcot (where you can take the boat to Hollywood Studios or the Monorail to Magic Kingdom) but we opted to drive ourselves. Parking, internet and refrigerators are free at the Radisson - each of those items cost $12 extra at one of the Disney hotels we stayed at last year. These \"extra cost\" savings of $36 plus the significantly lower cost versus the Disney hotel we previously stayed at make this a great deal. With respect to the location being somewhat difficult to get in and out of - we recommend taking Hotel Plaza Blvd to Buena Vista Drive in order to get to the Disney parks and come back on I-4 - this eliminates making a lot of unnecessary U-Turns.", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow U.K.", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant hotel-stay here!\u201d", "Author": "Nonhairybiker", "ReviewID": "UR22078698", "Content": "Stayed for four nights mid November, having chosen the hotel based on the preceding reviews.

Car park and grounds are also well kept and the plentiful spaces with two main entrances meant there was never far to walk. Despite interstate 4 across the way, we never found the noise intrusive in fact the aircon unit disturbed us more. There is a large tacky eyesore of a gift shop across from the hotel but the surrounding area seemed safe. A short walk takes you to several choices of places to eat and a supermarket. Everywhere else you'll want to go is easily reached, I cannot fault the location. Staff were exceptionally courteous and very pleasant and helpful. The reception staff allowed us unconditional use of internet terminal. Unless you have your own laptop, there is no other option. There is a ticket sales desk in the lobby but we were not overly pressured as is usually the case. We used the pool and hot tub, both excellent.

This hotel is an asset to the radisson chain. The front desk were welcoming and very very helpful and the customer service/vacation planning desk personel were friendly and to their credit not pushy ( which i have found in other hotels) The room we had was 621 facing away from the I4 and was quiet and the room was excellent , clean, well maintained with plenty of space to walk around. A bit short on actual drawer space but we worked around it, but the drawer space would be a bit pushed for 4 persons so maybe a small chest of drawers would help and not take up to much space. We had an issue with the WC but this was sorted by the staff in approx 15mins (very impressed by the service attitude) as was the safe, which had been left locked, also sorted. The fridge was excellent and microwave easy to use as was the iron and board. The flat screen TV was excellent and the signal only froze once but again maintaince were there at top speed (all they did was unplug it and plugged it back in,easy when you know how) . The ice machine and the soft drinks machine on the same floor were good and the drinks not over priced. The only real problem we had was with the restaurant. We arrived on the Saturday evening and noted that the buffet breakfast on Saturday and Sunday was USD 14.50 per person and had \"10 hot items\". We usually try the breakfast on the first day at the hotel, as this gives us a guide to the standard. After all the American buffet breakfast is standard to all hotels. Oh boy did we regret this option, at 0930 on a Sunday the place was deserted (we should have realised then that is was not that good). The 10 \"hot\" items ranged from pancakes,oats,grits( i think),corned beef hash, hash browns,sausages,tomatoes, bacon,scrambled eggs and 1 empty space which i found out later was for fried eggs with broken yokes. Nothing was labled so it guess what is time. Hot was not a word i would have used, luke warm was closer to the mark. The tables did not have the usual bottle of ketchup (you had to askfor it) and the quest for the syrup to go with the pancakes, well you had to ask for that as well. When we got the bill we found that fruit juices were NOT included in the basic price and they wanted 15% service charge on top for a self service buffet!! We paid and left never to return. Thankfully the Cross Roads shopping plaza had an excellent Perkins for breakfast (hot and tasty and service with a smile) as well as the usual Macdonalds and a Red Lobster and another steak house. The road entrance to the hotel is a bit of a draw back but I understand from the front desk staff that they may, in the future, be a road connection from the Cross Roads plaza, I hope so as it would make it a lot easier and safer.But all in all not a real issue. The front desk staff and room service were excellent and we would stay again and recommend this property , just avoid the restaurant.", "Date": "October 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cBEAUTIFUL\u201d", "Author": "Katmssktty", "ReviewID": "UR21384936", "Content": "Excellent service, from the front desk to the restaurant.

It was the end of the summer season & quietening down a little, but we were still able to visit a lot of the surrounding areas, & enjoyed ourselves a great deal. We booked our accommodation via the hotel website directly, & confirmed a place to stay for the duration of our holiday. On our arrival (via rental car), we discovered that the hotel was a large complex, close to Disneyworld & loads of restaurants & other attractions within a very close (driving) distance. Our room was really nice (great value for money), with 2 queen beds, private bathroom (with shower over small bath), massive flatscreen TV, free broadband internet, microwave, fridge, coffee maker, & alarm clock/ipod docking station \u2013 awesome! There is parking outside the hotel (within the complex) & also a fitness centre, swimming pool & spa. There is a bar/cafe where you can buy food (including breakfast), but I think that there are better deals elsewhere. Within the same complex there is an attractions-booking desk, a large souvenirs store & a waffle house. The air conditioning in the rooms was excellent, although a little noisy. There are two large lifts, so this hotel would suit older people who may have trouble with stairs, & it would also suit large groups. We were very impressed with the hotel compared to the standard of hotels we had stayed in in other cities for the same amount of money. The service was also excellent, & the staff went to great lengths to ensure our stay was perfect. We didn\u2019t go to any of the Disneyworld attractions, but it appears that there is a free shuttle from the hotel to many of the parks. We spent our time at the Kennedy Space Centre, which is about an hour or so away (the pick up centre for internet tickets is only about a 2 minute drive away \u2013 very convenient). Overall, we thought this hotel was excellent! All in all, if you are after a great hotel with a few luxuries for your money, then this is the hotel for you. It\u2019s close to a lot of amenities & is not expensive. If we are ever in the Orlando area again we would definitely stay here.

The location was great, only a few miles drive from the hotel to Disney world resort. The hotel also has a complimentary shuttle service to Epcot park in Disney. I can honestly only say good things about this hotel; The reception staff was very nice and helpful. It was also great value for money and for the first time in the US the money that we paid for the booking covered all the hotel taxes just like it stated in our Expedia statement. The room was very spacious, clean and nicely decorated (exactly as shown on the website). The bathroom was also stylish, clean and had a great shower. There are some good diners and fast food restaurant very near the hotel (walking distance) however, there is a good size fridge and microwave in the room so you can make a simple dinner at the room too. Ice machines are situated on each floor and there is an ice bucket in the room. The swimming pool is probably a bit small for such a big hotel but I think most people who stay at this hotel chose it for the great location for Disney world. However, you can most probably enjoy the sunshine and relax by the pool provided that it is not too crowded. There is also a small but well equipped gym on the ground floor of the hotel. The breakfast menu is very nice with generous portions and they serve Starbucks coffee. I would certainly recommend this hotel to other people and I would definitely stay at this hotel again in the future. Few tips; If you take the hotel shuttle service to the resorts (takes you to Epcot) and you intend to use the Disney world bus shuttle service between resorts during the day, make sure that allow plenty of time to get from one resort to the other as it takes you around in circles and it is really difficult to figure out how to get from one resort to the other.", "Date": "October 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wrexham, North Wales", "Title": "\u201cVery clean and convenient hotel\u201d", "Author": "Grfter", "ReviewID": "UR20965862", "Content": "Spent a week here from 28/09 to 05/10 with my wife and two teenage daughters and had a great time.

Only entrance is off I-4 going into the disney area and you are unable to get back to it leaving disney area unless you go under I-4 and make a U-turn at the first traffic light on the other side which is not easy in heavy traffic. Hotel is sitting on a hill with paving stones instead of paved and it is really easy to trip which I might add I did. I might add this happened while I was waiting for my room to be ready and the staff did not actually seem to care much but did offer a tisue to wipe off the blood and a couple of band aids. DO NOT get a room that is setup for the handicapped unless you are. I reserved a Delux King and got a handicapped room that would be nice if I were in a wheelchair but not so nice if your not, no place to put anything in the bathroom and I would guess the previous guest had a problem since it had a very bad oder. Most of the cleaning staff spoke only spanish so you might not want to engage one in conversion unless you speak spanish. The general desk staff was OK and tried to be as helpful as possible, but not one of the better places I checked into. To recap (Problems - Not easy entrance or exit. Not a very seasoned staff, but in all fairness it was a newer hotel. Rooms not great but OK, should be better for newer hotel. Must be real careful when walking in the parking lot, paving stones have settled and some are sticking up while others are missing. Good Points) Prices was OK.

The front desk person greeted us and welcomed us to the hotel with a pleasant smile and answers to all of our questions. The only negative were that you have to do a U-turn to get to the hotel if coming from Downtown Disney area (no big deal). Cannot tell you if it is good for children as we do not have any, but the ones we saw there were very happy. Hotel layout - The moment that you go into the Lobby you will find that the floors are a beautiful gray and black marble with shiny and clean accents. Toward the left is the Customer Service/Timeshare desk and directly beside it is the Front Desk. Long corridors with carpeted accents and a very nicely detailed lobby area for each floor with a coke machine and an ice maker. Security cameras everywhere. The elevators have a shiny pattern to it and are extremely well kept with modern accents and a nice green glow to the buttons once activated, they were always fast. The Room \u2013 We stayed in room 619 which gives you a view of the Cross Roads Shopping plaza (in this case this is one of the best views of the hotel because all you mostly see is a nice big American flag and the beautiful Florida Foliage). Room 619 was amazingly clean, very luxurious bathroom and reasonably spacious, we booked for 1 king bed but they were not available and were given a double room, no big deal because the size of the 2 queen beds was just right. The bathroom is elegant with black granite and marble floor and tiles, a good huge mirror and a spacious shower with toiletries that you would expect to receive at a Diamond class hotel. Plenty of towels and toiletries. Housekeeping staff was extremely detailed in their job. A very spacious closet with Iron and ironing board with a safe in the wall. There was a fridge in the room as well as a microwave. Here are some of the pros and cons about the whole experience. Pros - - Rooms are spacious and clean, with beautiful accents and plenty of bright lighting. - Comfy sleep number beds. - The bathroom is amazing and has all the ameneties you will need. It also has extra towels under the sink. Beautiful sink and huge mirror. Water pressure was excellent as well as water temperature. - The location is excellent, located just I-4 and FL535 with a 5 minute drive to Downtown Disney. Note- if walking Downtown Disney is somewhat of a far walk. - All the staff is courteous, efficient and helpful. - Pool is clean and lounge chairs are very comfortable. - Walking distance to many restaurants, mini-golf, supermarket and gas stations with convenience stores. - Despite location the rooms are extremely quiet. - Hotel does NOT charge for parking or a resort fee as many other 5 star resorts do. - The hotel is very new and you will feel it. Cons - TV had a bad signal for most channels all the time, we were told by the Maintenance person that the cable has been very spotty and that they were working on it. It was never solved. Not a big deal as we only spend a very small fraction of our day at the room. - Buffet food on Saturdays and Sundays is extremely expensive for the kind of food offered. My wife and I ate there once and got sick. Will not try their buffet again. - Pool temperature was cool but still tolerable and is somewhat small for the size of the hotel. We also never saw the Tiki bar open. - Drawer space needs to be bigger. I guess it needs to be that way for the comfort and size of the room. I would recommend bigger drawer space. One small note worth mentioning is that the front desk goes out of their way to help you with any request, my wife sent out some postcards on our 3rd day of arrival and the front desk offered to take them and mail them free of charge. These are small but worthy of mention details that make the Radisson Lake Buena Vista a very good place to stay. We cannot wait to go back to the Disney Area and stay at this wonderful elegant and well appointed 5 star hotel for the price of a 3 star.
