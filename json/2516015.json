They also provide a continental breakfast which was more than satisfactory....we took the tray back to our room both mornings and had cereal and bagels and OJ etc. As soon as you walk out the entrance, you simply cross the road and enter the walk through tunnel which takes you into the Highland Shopping Complex, and this is safe at any time. This then leads out onto Hollywood Boulevard. We ate at Californian Pizza Kitchen which was nice and Hard Rock Cafe. We also, took the subway which is just outside the shopping complex to Universal Studios which is only 1 stop away!

Other than that, the staff was nice, the suites included a full kitchen with pots and pans, so you could cook a full meal. A Fresh and Easy grocery store is walking distance away so we ate a number of meals in our room.

Also, each suite has either a balcony or spacious patio deck. We had a patio deck and it was wonderful for smaller, informal meetings.

I shared with my daughter and my husband with our son; we were concerned about being squished in the bed but to be honest we could almost all have shared one. THEY ARE ENORMOUS!! As other reviewers have said, this place is not palatial by any stretch. The rooms are very well used and are as clean as you could reasonably get a place which has painted kitchen cupboards. Housekeeping were great, the rooms were made up every day. The lady in the breakfast room was just lovely; she sliced my kids' croissants for them and couldn't do enough to help. All of the front desk staff were lovely too; couldn't have been better really. I take my hat off to them for storing our mountains of luggage on our last day between checking out & leaving for LAX. Definitely ask them for one of their bus / metro info sheets; they tell you where to catch buses for different destinations which really took some of the stress out of a trip to The Grove shopping centre (well worth a visit, esp to the farmer's market - fab pizza and doughnuts to die for!!!). Apparently when we were there we missed Jack Black filming... we were 100m away having lunch, so google it before you go as we were told that they advertise what's going to be happening there. Universal Studios is one stop away on the Metro... easy peasy.... there's a huge supermarket just further up Hollywood Boulevard - can't miss it... walk a couple of blocks and then it's down a flight of stairs on the right.

Great service, great food and great prices. Also walked down N Highland Ave to Inn and Out Burger (yummo) on W Sunset Blvd. Just across the rd is a huge discount shoe shop (Off Broadway) where the kids got some well priced Adidas trainers & Nike hi-tops.

They have standard hotel rooms, but also huge suites. The rooms come with full sized kitchens and they have upgraded the furniture and televisions since my last stay. They also have secure parking. There is a heated pool and a rooftop garden. In the morning, they serve a pretty decent continental breakfast with juices, bagels, fruit, cereal, etc. They also have both a computer you can use in the breakfast area and free wi-fi. You have to understand that this is an old property, so it is quite dated, but it is clean. The only thing I found to be not as clean as I thought it should be was the shower curtain. I think it might have gotten missed as it was a little dirty on the inside. Otherwise, I feel comfortable staying here. I didn't give it 5 stars, because it's not a five star hotel. There are Marriotts I don't even give a five star to, but for what you get for the price, this is an amazing place to stay. Oh, the price! This visit I stayed in a one bedroom (king bed) suite with a living room sofa bed and of course, a full kitchen. It's was $140 out the door. That's an average cost for a hotel, but if you want something decent in this area of Hollywood, this is the only thing you will find at this price that isn't grungy. It's just a little piece of affordable Hollywood. If only they would nix the bedspreads and go to duvets! That's really my only complaint! Have I mentioned the location?

Yes, that is where the Kodak Theater is (think Oscars) and the El Capitan is across the street, and Grauman's Chinese Theater is a couple blocks away.

The first morning we were there we went down for their continental breakfast. I was tired from travelling and forgot my purse, which had our passports and much of our holiday cash, hanging on the back of a chair. The hotel staff saved my purse and put it in their office. It was approx. 1.5 hours later when I realized it was missing. I went to the office, and they said they knew who it belonged to, however they did not know which room I was in. Nothing was missing! This could have been a really bad start to our holiday. Thanks for being honest :) The location was great. Many people told me that Holllywood was a bad place to stay, but the hotel location and that section of Hollywood Bouvelard was great. My thirteen year old son and I even went for a walk on Hollywood Bouvelard at 10:00 PM on New Years Eve, and I felt fine. The extra security of the hotel was appreciated including the locking underground parking. It was also very handy to have access to a washer and dryer to do a few loads of laundry. There was a grocery store approx. 4 blocks away that we could walk to that had everything we needed. I had read the reviews on Trip Advisor and although the decor was not cutting edge, the quality of the bedding and pillows was good. The towels were even better quality than the ones we got on our Disney Cruise following. The staff was very friendly and helpful no matter who we were speaking to. It was great to have a spacious and comfortable suite to make as our home base. The subway station was also very close. The pool was not heated at this time of year, and we were busy sightseeing so we did not use it. We also went up to the roof top garden to see what was there. There was no one up there, but it appears a good place for smokers to relax. I did seem to lose the internet signal a couple of times, however it does it appear they have a few routers, so I would refresh and connect to a different one.

Lots of security getting into it but the front desk people were very friendly, helpful, and kind. Went up to our room...yes, it is an old apartment complex, but the room was huge! Large sitting area with attached kitchen, hallway to bedroom, and then bath area. Lots of storage area. The next best part after LOCATION is that it was very clean...especially the sheets...nice and crisp. Ok, the carpet is old and the linoleum in the bathroom is stained, but the tub, sink, toilet were clean. Couches in living room were plush and not seedy looking. They do ask you to clean the dishes you use but that's ok, especially since the dishes were nice and clean and new looking.

After reading reviews on TA was aware of what to expect of the hotel. It was as it had been reported, a little dated but very clean and well kept. We stayed in a one bedroom apartment with a full kitchen which was much appreciated after staying in hotels. The apartment had a sofa bed and we requested a rollaway as we had 2 children with us. The bed in the main bedroom was very comfortable, however the sofa bed and roll away were very uncomfortable. I would suggest trying to book a two bedroom apartment to avoid this. The price of $465 including tax for 3 nights was very good considering there were four of us and it included breakfast. The breakfast was very good with choice of cereals, fresh fruit, bagels to toast, croissants, coffee, tea, juice etc and as much you wanted. There was always a very helpful staff member there to assist and even toast your bagel for you. All members of the staff were friendly and helpful, booking taxis,giving directions etc. The location was excellent right near Hollywood Blvd with the Hollywood and Highland Centre with shops and places to eat, Kodak Theatre and Metro a few steps away. Grauman's Chinese Theatre was a short walk up the street. On the day we visited Universal Studios it was good having the Metro so close and it was only one stop to get there. The cost was $1.50 each way. The only small complaint was that being on the ground floor we could hear some noise from upstairs on one of the afternoons when a child was running around but did not disturb us at night. I would ask for an upstairs unit to avoid this.

We checked out the rooftop garden it looked like a good spot to suntan but was in desperate need of spending a few bucks to plant som flowers and put a little color up there. The shower and bath were old but fine as were the kitchen everything u need to cook and eat a meal. Our kitchen had a view of the kodak theater and the deliveries were constant but it didn't bother us. They have a cute lil parking gargae locked for your safety and each spot was named after a current celebrity. We parked in bead pitt and gweneth paltrow. The breakfast was great bagels and cream cheese every morning and juice and coffee and cereals and muffins. Plenty to get ur day started. There was a awesome tunnel footsteps away that lead u into the kodak theater and took u out to the walk of fame. We enjoyed the grill stekhouse happy hour and also hooters happy hr was great. We went in the roosevelt hotel for drinks at the 25 degrees bar and they were great drink we had a great time but they were definetly pricey for 2 beers and 4 cocktails ran us 70 bucks. Was worth it for a one timer and we enjoyed the lobby our daughter lounged and relaxed while looking at the neat ceiling. Very beautiful older hotel but way to pricey for me. We will be happy to return to the Hollywood Orchid suites in the future if they give us the great deal they did on night 2. I won't lit the price but both nights we were given a excellent deal. Full size kitchen was great.

The place is spotless although a little dated. We had a one bedroom suite where the lounge had been removed and replaced with another double bed. To share accommodations proved to save us money just about everywhere we travelled. The loungeroom was very large so to have a bed in it wasn't a problem. The suite also had a full kitchen. It was also very quiet. If there was any complaint I could make it is the fact that the bedroom didn't have a door on it so there was little privacy. If you are going to book this type of suite to share you had better know the other people you are staying with well as you have to pass the bedroom to get to the bathroom ;) If you are interested, we paid US$135 per night so if you split this between two couples it was extremely cheap.

First let me start by saying my husband and I are in our late 30's. Hardly party animals, not noisy people by nature. We arrived in LA from the UK late afternoon and tried to get straight on LA time, but inevitably we were wide awake at 3am the following morning. We got up, took showers and dressed - all done quietly, no TV turned on or anything. Yet the front desk found it necessary to call us around 4.30am to say that someone had complained about the \"noise\"!!!! What, the noise of us walking to the bathroom and back and having showers??! I explained to the person who called that we had simply arisen early, showered & dressed and they said yes.....it was probably the sound of the shower! That night when the people upstairs above us arrived back after their day out and we could hear every single footstep, every creak of the floorboards, hear when they flushed the toilet and when the shower ran, we understood how our everyday living sounds could have been heard. Still, a bit rich to complain and worse still that the hotel then called us - as if it's our fault the walls and floors are so thin your neighbours can hear you? Clearly it's an ongoing issue - so the hotel need to deal with it, not put the onus on paying guests! I have read MANY other reviews saying the same - so if you are okay walking on eggshells out of fear of offending people, this is the hotel for you. To my mind though, a hotel should be used to dealing with international travellers from different time zones and making sure that the hotel can handle this. I can honestly say - hand on heart - that we did not make any excessive noise, or much noise at all. We felt very awkward after the complaint, and more than a little upset. The bathroom was very small and quite shabby - dirty tiles, grouting etc. The taps in the sink area were old, dirty and need replacing. The suite itself (room 210) is spacious, with a new flat screen TV and dresser but the whole place has a feel of being old and basic, but we are fine with that - after all, it was also on the whole clean, safe and roomy. The positives are the location - you cannot get closer to Hollywood Blvd, the Metro, Hollywood & Highland shopping centre and The Kodak Theatre without paying twice, three times the price. This is the trade off you make - you get a very reasonable price of $109 per night if you book through the hotel website. Breakfast was very good, the communal areas (pool, roof terrace, lobby, computer area etc) are all clean and well maintained. The staff here are simply wonderful. Every single person we interacted with was polite, attentive and helpful; they are a credit to the hotel. The housekeeping is spot on. I wanted to love this hotel. By the end of the holiday I was feeling better about it all. Would I return? Probably, just for the price and the location. The Wifi is very sketchy. We often could not pick up the hotel wifi and ended up being connected to another network which worked better! With some updating, replacements made to basic things such as faucets and some replacement carpeting/walls/soundproofing, this hotel could be a 5 out of 5.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bethesda, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cmy home away from home in Hollywood\u201d", "Author": "sistinas138", "ReviewID": "UR120113887", "Content": "I just got back from my most recent trip and spent 5 nights at the Hollywood Orchid suites. It was my 2nd visit to the Hollywood Orchid - my friend and I stayed there a couple of years ago and really liked it, the only reason we hadn't stayed there on our last trip that it was already booked! It is a small hotel & apparently rather popular so my advice is book well in advance to get your room :) If you book directly through the hotel's own website you will get the best rate, we booked a room with 2 double beds and a kitchenette (fridge & mini stove with 2 burners, a cabinet of pans & dishes & silverware but no microwave) It is nothing lavish andt the furnishings and rooms look a bit dated but the Hollywood Orchid Suites has lots going for it - #1 is LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. It is immediately hidden behind the big Hollywood and Highland complex, I mean immediately as in walk outside the loading docks & cross the street and there it is. From the pool area you see the back wall of the Kodak Theater a few feet away. We went to see the Cirque Du Soliel Iris show in that complex as well as a Jimmy Kimmel taping across the street and it was wonderful to have such a short walk and not worry about parking and traffic.You can also catch the subway from there up to Universal Studios. Parking is free (great value!) and quite adequate for the hotel. I got a chuckle out of the fact that every parking space is named for a celebrity, I had enough trouble remembering what my nondescript silver rental car looked like but I could remember if it was \"Brad Pitt\" or \"Angelina Jolie\" very easily : ) the staff are all very friendly and helpful and glad to recommend things in the neighborhood and post helpful ideas of what to do in the elevators. A very nice continental breakfast is provided and they have a computer set up with a printer in the 2nd floor breakfast area that was very handy for printing out tickets. My only (very) minor complaint is that their wifi isn't very strong and connecting is a bit spotty in the rooms but worked better in the hall and breakfast area, at least we were able to do what we needed to do and didn't spend that much time awake hanging in the hotel as we kept very busy! It is definitely nothing fancy and if you 1st class accomodations and la-ded-ah decorating then pay 3x as much and stay at the Renaissance next door but I find the Hollywood Orchid Suites to be a great value and nothing could be more convenient!

It took us about 35 minutes to get to the airport even with early morning traffic. The heated pool was spotless and my sons enjoyed swimming there. Use of the laundry facilities was cheap and convenient. I noticed that it was one of the only hotels with secure parking. Breakfast is satisfying, various bagels, cereals, juices. Even the price of drinks from the vending machine was very reasonable. Yes the carpet in the room is a bit worn and so is the decor. If this bothers you, then pay $300+ for a fancier hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful, including all the people at the reception which is manned 24/7 and especially the lady who supplies the breakfast.

If you are in LA for a couple of days, and like us you don't feel like driving, there is no better location to stay. The location is just PERFECT. Orchid Suits are a one minute walk to a red Metro line (should you want to go to Universal Studios or downtown), and a one minute walk to where the city sightseeing buses start from. There is a nice Fresh & Easy supermarket less than five minutes walk away, and a shopping centre with restaurants, cinemas, clothes stores etc. literally at the hotel's doorstep. Yes, the decor of the rooms is a bit old, and the corridors are plain and undecorated, but I am perfectly aware that I can't expect a five star hotel for the price I paid. What I got for the price I paid, apart from the perfect location, was a spacious room with a large kitchen with a table for four, huge fridge, microwave, full gas cooker (which I didn't use), and a filter coffee maker (this was regularly used and much appreciated). We had a spacious and comfortable bed, a balcony overlooking the street towards Hollywood hills, a huge wardrobe and a bathroom with a separate wash basin. Breakfast was served on the first floor - choice of bagels, Philadelphia cheese, muffins, fresh fruit and cereal. You can eat the breakfast there, or take it to your room, which is not a problem as the room had a proper dining table. There was a nice swimming pool on the ground floor, and I went for a swim - I had it all to myself, and the water temperature was just right - I guess they know a thing or two about swimming pools in LA!

The Chinese Theatre, Stars on Hollywood Boulevard etc, the Train (Hollywood and Highland) so we could get to Universal Studios quickly and easily (one stop!) and the bus which we took to Venice Beach and also Rodeo Drive. The staff were great. We were impressed when we arrived in a taxi from Anaheim and the staff member was expecting us and then held the garage door open for us so we could wheel our bags to the lift rather than lug them up the stairs. Bliss. Breakfasts were a simple continental affair on the second floor - cereals, pastries, fruit, coffee , tea - but adequate. Not much space to eat there but trays were availbale and so we took ours to our room which was a great option with the kids. Our room was great. So spacious for the rate we paid. I thought they got our booking wrong! There was a separate bedroom in the rear which we gave to the kids,a and we took the bed in the main combined kitchen//dining area but did not lose out on space. (we wanted to access the fridge at night so it suited us ;-) The kitchen itself was basic and I couldn't imagine cooking much else than cheese on toast but who wants to cook on holidays in Hollywood anyway? Our bed turned out to be a little less comfortable than the kids. All it needed was a thicker mattress protector, which it seemed the kids room had. My only gripe was the smokers. The room was non-smoking but smokers were able to smoke on balconies, so we still encountered the smell as we wlake dor if we wanted to open our windows for fresh air -especially as our room was near the executive rooms which have their own private balconies and mostly has smokers in them :(", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic.\u201d", "Author": "VS0718", "ReviewID": "UR118549601", "Content": "We recently stayed here for 3 nights and loved it.

Nothing special when we arrived in front of the hotel, as the building looked a bit weary but clean. I found this hotel from TA (TripAdvisor) with good reviews stretched back to year 2009, and when I called, the front desk staff (Amalia) responded warmly including suggesting the room that may fit to the three of us. I brought her a small gift for her appreciating her valuable assistance through the phone. Okay, before the hotel itself, the location. Couldn't be more perfect. It's located at the heart of Hollywood itself. It's just behind the Kodak Theatre. We went to all major Hollywood attractions just by walking (Kodak Theater for Cirque du Soleil:Iris, you've just got to see this!, visited the MaxFactor Hollywood Museum, Hollywood Walk of Fame, Mann's Chinese Theatre, Hard Rock Cafe, Madame Tussauds, and others). There is also a shortcut to Hollywood Highland Mall (and Hollywood Boulevard) where you can shop and also have lots of choices for dining, further more, next to the mall is the Hollywood Highland Metro Station where we easily boarded the train for Universal Studios, just the next station away. There is also Budget Rent-a-Car across the street where then we rented a car (3-days) for trip to Disneyland, Santa Monica Beach, Griffith Park, Farmer's Market and other places. I found that returning the car very easy early in the morning and then walked back to the Hotel. Please be mindful that this is not a 5 star hotel but it fulfills your requirement of a safe, clean and quiet accomodaions with lots of extras. The room it self (Deluxe Suite) was very nice and spacious. More like an apartment. It has a living room with sofa bed, there is akitchen (complete with necessary utensils, pots and pans). A bed room with ample closet (another two at bathroom hallway). We took the advantage of having this kitchen and went to a grocery shop located in the neighborhood when we returned to the hotel late in the evening. There were two plasma TVs (one in the living room and another in the bedroom), really nice treat for myself and my son with our own favorite TV channels. Bathroom (with heater) were spotlessly clean with fine working hot/cold shower and decent water pressure. The housekeeping also great, they cleaned the room around 10-11 AM. Breakfast is included, although the breakfast corner is fairly small, you can always take them to your room where it has small dining table for 4. A paper bag is provided for this. A choices of croissants, muffins, frootloops/applejacks with fruits (bananas, apples) and coffee, tea and juices. These were more than enough to start your day. Another thing is the WiFi, I stayed in room 304 (or 305? I forgot) and it's fast. I chose 3rd floor as I was expecting no one will be stomping around above us but only expecting moderate WiFi reception, but turned out to be better. There is also a secured parking facility at no additional cost, located in the basement. Every guest will be given a key to open the automated door. Still at the parking level, there is coin laundry facility complete with ironing station and snack vending machine. There is also a pool but we didn't use it but on a warm-sunny day, this will be very inviting. Front staffs are always happy to assist you in giving directions and tips for the attractions. They even lightheartedly phoned a cab for us while we were having our breakfast before we checked out. I feel that I'd like to keep this as a secret, knowing this hotel, but when you're travelling with family surely you would've wanted this for the best value of your money can get.

This hotel has got quite big rooms! We got a room on the 2nd floor on the front (Orchid Street). We liked it immediately. The door is on the inside of the building, next to the breakfast area (noisy in the morning) and in the same space as the reception. The trouble began at midnight, my girlfriend couldn't sleep because of some ticking noise from the A/C. I had my earplugs in, but when she told me, I heard it too and couldn't figure out what it was. I thought expanding metal parts because of a cold-warm effect. Next to that, we could hear the phone at the reception ring every time and you could hear people talk quite easily. Because of the clicking noise and not be able to sleep I went downstairs to the reception to ask if there was another room available. They didn't have one right away (I can understand that), but if I came back the following morning, they would see which rooms would be available. The problem with the ticking A/C was because of condenswater from the A/C on the floor above us, which dripped on our A/C. Could be solved by placing a towel on the A/C outside, but that's a workaround... The nice lady at the reception offered us two rooms. One just above us, and the other one on the back of the building with a patio. We gladly took the one on the back. Maybe the room was a little bit smaller (don't know for sure), but the in-room safe was even bigger and the patio was great! As long as I can have a good night sleep, I'm happy. Problem solved. For light sleepers I would recommend not to sleep on the front side of the building. Request a room on the side (pool) or back, in the morning there are a lot of trucks unloading in the shoppingmall. Now some facts; Room is big and clean, I like the in-room safe, fully equiped kitchen. The only downside and which is mentioned earlier, are the matresses, they are quite hard on your back, but I still managed to get a good night sleep out of it. Large gated underground parkingspace. Light breakfast, with quite fast refilling of items. The building is next to the Highland mall, so within one minute you are in the mall, within two minutes you are on the Walk of Fame. The metro to Universal Studios is one block away, a ticket costs $ 1,50 one way and after a couple of minutes you are at your destination. I don't know if Universal Studios has a parking fee (in Florida they do), but if you use the underground, you can save some money on that. Would I go to this hotel in the future? Sure!

The Bad: the hotel is older (60s maybe) which is fine for the price, however the air conditioner was older and very loud and positioned 3 feet from the bed at the same height as the bed so I either had to chose between no air conditioning (a bit hot and stuffy with 3 people in the room) or near arctic conditions blowing on my back all night.

Robby Krieger the original Doors guitarist and song writer even showed up and played!!! We got there early so we ended up eating there and the cheese burger & fries were really good.

We declined both a few times but they didn't hassle you after that. Even in San Diego you get asked a lot to go on their buggy rides. They are more persistent and you have to say no at least twice. We also went to the Griffith Observatory where the view alone is worth the drive up there! The huge telescopes were not open to the public during the afternoon so we didn't get a chance to view anything but the rest of the building was open and the exhibits were very interesting. We toured the Hollywood Bowl after that and learned a lot of history about the place. Both the Griffith and Bowl were free entry! We went to Chinatown in downtown L.A. for dinner and it was okay.

After exhaustive searching by myself and my friend we decided the Hollywood Orchid Suites would be just the ticket! Happily I booked, with no issue. I arrived in LA on 3/12/11 and called the hotel to find out if it would be okay to check-in must later than the usual check in time. No problem, your room will be waiting for you. Excellent! Fast forward to later that night. After I am buzzed into the hotel (yes, buzzed in like an apartment building) I am met by the \"receptionist\" who appears to be the only one around trying to do everything (including informing a guest, who while trying to do laundry had the machine turn off on her, to push the electric cord in all the way and the machine will start again). I was checked in and handed a key with a large chunk of plastic attached which can only be likened to old fashioned computer punch cards. The key was for the garage gate, the hunk of plastic, the room key to 311. I make my way into the garage, park my car and proceed to the wide OPEN door to the hotel to a hallway that is pitch black. Now, the only way you can get into the garage is if you are a guest with a key for the gate. However, as a woman by herself, I found this to not be best circumstance to be in. Upon arriving on the third floor, I see a very long open hallway. Wondering where room 311 is I start down the hallway and low and behold, 311 is way down at the end. The issue with this? This section is almost separated from the rest of the rooms in the floor sharing space with a staircase, slop closet and another unidentifiable padlocked room. After several tries and a heavy shoulder I get the room door open. I enter a musty, dank room with the bed barely 5 ft from the door, sagging chairs, water stained ceiling, peeling paint, a rusty aged heater, filthy curtains, AC not on (when turned on not pumping anything out), a circuit breaker box, a cigarette burn on the bathroom counter, a bathroom fan that appears to not have been cleaned for years and the shower pipe separating from the wall. But the kitchen was spotless. Oh, and the reason the door was so hard to open as my friend discovered? The frame of the door looked like the door had been kicked in and then rehung. I immediately went downstairs to check out. I received a full refund as the hotel was fully booked but was also told that room 311 has often been requested and that the hotel has never received complaints about it. Maybe I am picky (as the \"receptionist\" tried to insinuate) but I don't think it is too much to think that my room be clean and in good condition. Be warned, the pictures online looked very different than what I received and perhaps it was because it was the last room due to my late check-in, but there should never be that much of a discrepancy in standards between rooms in a hotel.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancashire", "Title": "\u201cHighly Recommended\u201d", "Author": "WeHateFlying", "ReviewID": "UR107550021", "Content": "2 night stay (in different rooms- 209, 213, due to late booking), early May.

If I hadn't been to this area of LA before, that probably would have scared me a bit...not really sure why they find the need to lock themselves in at 8pm.

Our room was large, but could have used some updating or at least some lights. It was a bit dreary and dark in there. Free wifi & free parking where great though, as is the location! I probably would have given in a 4 had it not been the smoking. They let people smoke on the porch and alllll the smoke seep into our room under the door. I woke up in the morning thinking the room was on fire. We went to breakfast and came back to find our room reeked of smoke. I'm still scared they're are going to slap us with a fine for smoking in our nonsmoking room. The other weird thing was our check out. The checkout time was noon.

The kids loved being able to stand in the stars footprints at the Chinese Theatre (less than a 2 minute walk from our room). Additionally for us having a suite with two rooms (for considerably less than many others in the area charge for a twin) was fantastic. Despite being in the thick of it there was no noise that we noticed as its at the back of the Kodak Theatre and mall and down a side street so the noise was really non existant. The staff were great (saved us a fortune with their advice on tickets for Universal) and the trip to the Studios was less than a 10 min drive.

We stayed in a Junior Suite and it was spacious, clean and comfortable. The only complaint I had during our stay was that the walls are extremely paper thin. If you decide to stay there, I hope you have quiet neighbours. Because some of the rooms have kitchens within, we could hear cabinets opening and closing, cutlery, pots and pans banging around... on our first night, we also heard the TV from next door turned on... unfortunately he/she did not turn it off until 3am. If you have a room facing Orchid Avenue, which is also the street located at the back of the shopping centre, you will be woken up at 5-6am each day (I think only weekdays) by trucks unloading stuff for the shops in the shopping mall I presume.

It doesn't have those things and frankly, it doesn't need them. What the Orchid Suites does have is this: Helpful and friendly desk staff, clean but dated rooms and a location that's nigh impossible to beat for a visitor to Hollywood. Just steps from the Orchid Suites' front door is a passage into the Hollywood Highland center, right in the heart of Hollywood Boulevard: think Kodak Theater, Mann's Chinese Theater and more people trying to take you on celebrity tours than you can shake a stick at. It also puts you pretty much directly on top of a metro station that can take you to Universal Studios and beyond. Meanwhile, parking is free and the underground lot seems pretty secure, so if you've got a car you shouldn't have to worry about someone taking it for a joyride. The rooms themselves are fairly unexceptional, but there's little to complain about. We found our room to be clean and a little old... no surprises there. The floor was a little lumpy in spots and the suite could have probably used a renovation. But it was perfectly functional and given the choice of new carpet and a soft underlay underfoot or the affordable rates at the Orchid Suites, I'd go with the cheaper rate every time. Let me be clear, though: This is not a place that gets by on its location alone. With an older building like this, preserving the sense that it's clean is not an easy thing to do. Yet that was my first (quite pleasant) realization after checking in (\"this place *is* clean!\") If you're looking for luxury, go somewhere else. But if you're looking for somewhere to rest your weary bones for a reasonable price, this is the place. Clean, comfortable accommodation and a great location at a great price.

The hotel has free underground parking which is great for the location. It's also secured. So is the hotel, although I never felt unsafe in the area. The area seems pretty busy well into the night. We had a two bed room with kitchen and dining room and it was huge. The kitchen had everything you would need to cook yourself. It has a full fridge and stove, utensils and sink, you name it. The beds were queen size and extremely comfortable. The A/C was a little tricky to work but not impossible. They have wi-fi and they serve breakfast from about 8-10am. There is also a rooftop patio or gathering area but nothing was really going on up there when we checked it out. The pool looked fairly large and very clean but it was too chilly to use it anyway. The best way to describe this place is to picture all the new places you see that look horrible inside because they don't keep it up. Well this place is rather old but kept up very well. So it features a lot of true hard wood fixtures, old ceramics and older appliances, kept up very well. It reminded me a lot of my grandparents house. The best part was the cost. For the location and proximity to everything nearly possible, you can not beat the price at all. I would imagine that if there is a major event going on in Hollywood, you probably want to book early. But I went the week of the AFI Festival and got in fine and I don't believe the place was sold out (although by the end of the week the parking basement seems to get pretty full). And if something is going on, walk out to the boulevard and the chinese theater. You might see somebody. We saw Will Ferrell and Sylvester Stallone while there, and several other semi-famous stars too. There's even a Coldstone Creamery in the Center. And the California Pizza Kitchen was awesome.

Other attractions on Hollywood Blvd include tour providers, chain stores, the Kodak Theatre, El Capitan Theatre, Madame Tussauds, Grauman's Chinese and Egyptian Theatres and Ripley's Believe it or Not. Public transport is readily available on Hollywood Blvd - buses (212/213/217/780 express) arrive frequently and travel directly to places such as CBS Studios, The Grove, Melrose Avenue, La Brea Tar Pits and the LA Museum of Art. The entrance to the Hollywood/Highland Metro station is opposite the eastbound bus stop. Universal Studios is one stop away from Hollywood/Highland station. Other areas that can be accessed by metro include Downtown, Chinatown, Long Beach and LAX. A one-way trip on the bus or train costs $1.50.

The breakfast area is small so we used a tray and took food back to our room. We could not have asked for more. We didn\u2019t use it, but there is a laundry room downstairs. Everyone is friendly, including the reception staff, the janitors, and the breakfast lady. We never encountered an unhappy face or a negative word fro the staff. The hotel is five minutes walk from the Avenue of Stars and another five minutes to the Chinese Theatre. What could be better? From the shopping mall, you can see the Hollywood sign on the hills. To get to Universal Studios, take the subway. The station is five minutes from the hotel and one stop on the subway. Cross the street and take the free shuttle bus to the studio. That will save time and aggravation with driving and save money on parking, too. There are a plethora of souvenir shops, food stores, and restaurants within walking distance. Unfortunately, there is poor public transport to Disney Land, so you have to drive there. It is about 45 minutes. If you are going to Disney Land for several days, you might want to move to a hotel that is nearer! The only negative aspect is that they have designated smoking spots and occasionally the cigarette smoke drifted into our room. They should just make the entire hotel smoke free.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cWelcome to Hollywood\u201d", "Author": "louluvslabs", "ReviewID": "UR81550497", "Content": "This hotel is right in the heart of the action, about 1 minute walk to the Hollywood & Highland shopping centre and the famous walk of fame.

I came across the Orchid Suites on a website, checked it out on Trip Advisor and it had pretty good reviews, so we booked the last room available for two people - a junior suite. I was expecting it to be small, but it was quite roomy, with two double beds, a kitchenette, a TV, nice bathroom, closet and safe, which came in very handy. There are many positives about the hotel. They include: * friendly hotel staff - I think the guy was called Marlo, he always had a friendly smile and was too happy to give advice and tips * free internet!! which was so handy, it was great being able to check your email in the morning and at night and print out tickets to theme parks * free continental breakfast every morning - we were so appreciate to have access to cereal, fresh fruit, muffins, bagels, tea, coffee every morning...it was simple but a great way to start the day of sightseeing * location, location, location! Just a walk to Walk of Fame, Chinese Theatre (which is handy if you want to take a Starline Tour to any of the theme parks, around the city, etc), the metro is just down the street (which is just one stop away from Universal Studios) * decent sized swimming pool (which we didnt use) * free parking (which again, we didnt use but was a great option to guests who needed it) * decent sized rooms - more than enough space to store your suitcases.

Facilities are great for the price - 24hr desk, free and secure parking (guaranteed space), decent sized pool, rooftop terrace, free Internet access, PC & printer plus a full kitchen (utensils & crockery are basic). Breakfast is called 'light continental' but there was lots of food on the buffet every morning so you won't go hungry - cereals, fruit, bagels (& cream cheese), croissants, muffins, tea, coffee, orange juice, etc. Plus, you can take it all back to your room or sit on the roof terrace to enjoy some sunshine with your meal. The staff were all very friendly and helpful - directing us to the closest supermarket (fresh & easy, just past the Chinese Theatre), printing maps for us when the PC was busy (usually at breakfast time & early evening) and booking a $55 fixed rate taxi deal to the airport.

The room had two queen beds and full kitchen, dinette table, flat screen TV and bathroom with separate sink. The sink being separate worked out great when getting ready in the mornings. Although the room was dated, it was clean. We had a small balcony and table that looked out over Orchid Avenue which we did not use. Although we did not use the kitchen to cook it was nice having a fridge, plates, utensils and glasses to use when we brought home take out. The staff is friendly and useful. They have pamphlets near the front desk for sightseeing and ideas on things to do in Los Angeles. A continental breakfast was included with the usual fare of muffins, bagels, cereal, coffee, tea and juice. There was a small pool but the weather was cool during our stay so we did not use it. There is a computer and printer which was handy when printing out our boarding passes. I loved the use of the free underground parking garage which always had plenty of parking. The hotel is not very aesthetically pleasing but it was such a bargain and a great base for traveling to all the sights we saw. The hotel is centrally located to Hollywood sight's and about a ten minute drive to Universal Studios and the Griffith Observatory. It is also near the scenic Mulholland drive and very easy to get around to most of the sights we saw. The furthest drive was Santa Monica which took around forty five minutes. The only issue was that there was some construction going on around the Hollywood and Highland mall which we were able to hear in the mornings but it did not impede on my sleep. One night they were some noisy neighbors that did wake me up around 4am but this is not the hotel's fault. What to do in Los Angeles Mulholland Drive: Nice scenic drive through the Hollywood Hills. They are some great scenic lookouts. Checkout Runyon Canyon Park for some trails. Getty Center: Beautiful architecture, gardens and grounds, also nice overview of LA Griffith Observatory: My favorite for a scenic overview of LA and the Hollywood Sign Universal Studios: pales in comparison to Florida Disney parks but had a great time here nonetheless. Favorite was the Simpson and Mummy ride. Rodeo Drive/Beverly Hills: Saw some really nice houses. I like 5th Avenue in NYC better in comparison to Rodeo. Farmer's Market and Grove: Although not an outdoor outlet complex, it reminded me of Woodbury Commons in NY, however much nicer. I really enjoyed the Farmer's market. Had some good old fashioned pistachio ice cream and great brazilian churrascaria. Santa Monica: The pier reminded me a little of Coney Island in Brooklyn but much nicer. I enjoyed the Third Street Promenade. Although the shops were nothing new they had a lot of my favorite ones on one small strip. Also kudos to the H&M there for having my size and the clothes not being in a disarray like most of the H&M stores in NYC. Had pretty good pizza at a place called Joe's but still not as good as pizza in NYC. It's the water...heh Venice Beach: the beach itself was mediocre. It reminded me of a inferior Greenwich village. Not my vibe but was fun to walk through. Felt that an hour there was enough. Hollywood: an inferior Times Square. You have to experience it but an hour is more than enough. Took a tour of the Kodak which I enjoyed. Unfortunately the theatre was covered in plastic due to construction for a new cirque du Soleil. Mel's Diner has the best burgers ever!

I was in town for the TCM Classic Film Festival. First, the MANY pros: -Price. $139/night, was approximately 1/3 the cost of the \"official hotel sponsors\"--the Roosevelt and the Rennaisance. -Very spacious room. It was more like a studio apartment than a hotel room with sleeping area, full kitchen, four-seat dining table, ample closet space, and bath with shower/tub combo. -Location. The property is right behind the Kodak Theater and adjacent to the back entrance of the shopping mall right next to the theater. One might think that the location in back of something else might make it more seedy or dangerous to walk around, but as a solo traveler, I can tell you that I felt much safer taking the quick right into the mall rather than venturing out onto the streets at night. -Attentive staff. The property is small enough that they recognize you quickly. You either have to use your room key or get buzzed into the front door. I never once managed to produce my key quicker than I was buzzed in. There is a security camera by the front door that they use to recognize you. Since I am a lone female, I requested a room near the front desk when I made my reservation and they honored it by giving me the closest one with a clear sight-line from the desk to my room. -Easy access to public transportation...no small feat in LA. I don't like to take long cab rides when I'm traveling alone so chose to use the Flyaway bus from LAX (thanks for the tip, Amazing Race!) to the Union Station stop then the Red metro train line to the stop just 1/2 block from the Orchid Suites. This is the first time I've taken public transport in LA. On the way from LAX, I was not familiar with the system/times so it took about 1.75 hours to make the trip. On the way back, I timed it better and was at the airport in just under one hour. -the small pool was clean, private and lovely. There is also a rooftop garden and sitting area on the top floor where I can imagine it would be nice to enjoy a drink with friends...especially if you want that drink with a smoke. -free wireless internet throughout the property. They issue you a security code at check-in. Two Cons: -beds are moderate. Not terrible, with springs sticking out, just not up to the level I'm used to at Westin, Hilton and Wyndham. I did manage to sleep fine, but it took a bit to get comfortable. -No view. The hotel is surrounded by parking lots/access roads on three sides. In conclusion, I thought the Orchid Suites was an excellent value and will certainly book there again next time I'm in town. Didn't cook anything in the kitchen (there are plenty of restaurants and quick stops in the area), but found the fridge to be a convenient and cheaper way to keep leftovers and drinks than going out for more.

I did feel that there were three things that needed improvement. 1, replace mattress's they were a bit brutal. 2. replace the 19\" tube tv. but then again I might be a bit spoiled from my own flat 52\" 3. more knowledgeable front desk clerks. They knew very little about what was going on in the LA area. So do your homework before you come. They were of very little help. They offered free internet and free parking which really most hotels in the are charged for , so those two saved us money! There was also a sky top garden which didn't seem like anyone used.

The hotel itself is a pretty no frills motel style deal..we were lucky enough to get one of the few (I think there's 3?) rooms with a sun filled balcony. Really nice to relax on at the end of the day. The kitchen was handy with a full size fridge and would be great for families...bed's comfortable enough. Bathroom was fairly average and the shower water pressure wasn't great but for the price we paid who could complain! It was nice to be able to walk downstairs and collect a few things for breakfast and bring a plate back to your room...great having a pool too. Really it's all about location...sephora, johnny rockets, cpk, mac, cinemas, forever 21 you name it right on your doorstep. Universal studios is also only one stop on the subway away and super easy to get to. The Starline tours all leave from the HH mall too and only 30 seconds walk from the hotel.

NOT handicap friendly. Stairs up to check-in desk and to small elevator. Nice staff. Walls thin as paper. Decent breakfast. (coffee,tea, cereal, juice, muffins, bread, jam, fruit) Has a very sloooow but serviceable computer and printer for everyone. $15 per person shuttle bus from airport. (We didn't buy shuttle bus tickets ahead of time, but we did not go during high season) Did not rent a car. Jimmy Kimmel show, Madame Tussaud's, Graumann's, Kodak theatre, shopping centre and grocery store 1-4 blocks away from hotel. If it's the first time in Hollywood for you and you want to do the tourist thing, I would recommend taking hop-on hop-off Starlight bus tour for 2 days which office you will find about 2 blocks away from hotel. Although the subway & bus stops are about 2 blocks away from the hotel, you won't be able to identify trivial things like \"where Jim Carey stayed when he first came to Hollywood\" unless it's pointed out to you (like they do on the tour bus) and frankly, we just didn' t have enough time to plan and travel around by bus & subway (if you do take public transport, buy the $5 day pass for unlimited travel for the day) The tour bus also gets you to Santa Monica where you can walk (45 minutes) to Venice Beach. Souvenirs on Santa Monica Beach are 1/2 price on Venice Beach. You can also use the tour bus to go to downtown L.A., Chinatown (where you can bargain for items) , Farmers' Market, CBS Studios, Paramount Studios, Rodeo Drive, Melrose street, and to Universal Studios Theme Park (which we didn't go into). Went to Jay Leno show which was good. Also went to the Warner Bros tour. This is a very good tour and our tour guide Tara was extremely well informed and entertaining. Also went to 4 hour taping of \"New Adventures of Old Christine\". That actually went very quickly bc the emcee was incredibly funny. They give you pizza & water. For both Leno & \"New Adventures\" they say you can't bring in cameras, but as long as you don't use it, \"Leno\" won't take it away from you . Leno comes out before show & chats . If you ask nicely, he will usually take a pic with you. Will also stop and give you an autograph & shake your hand if you wait outside for about 1/2 hour after the taping. \"New Adventures\" will take your camera and hold it for you until you leave. It's a $25 taxi fare (one way) from the hotel to Burbank where Leno & Warner Brothers Studios are. NOT worth going to are Hollywood Wax Museum & Guinness World of Records Museum. Celebrity & TV & movie character Impersonators in front of Graumann's & Kodak theatre. To take pics with them, be ready to tip them $2 to $4. They don't ask for money and many tourists will not tip them, but remember this is what many of them do for a living. So the better the costume, the better the tip. Went to Los Angeles County Museum of Art - LACMA *sigh* Maybe it's bc I've been to the museums in Paris, New York & London, but I don't consider this a world class museum. Architecture is good, tho (I know that it gets raves from others so I was disappointed. I suggest you go to the Getty instead) Personally, I prefer New York bc everything is pretty close by and subway more extensive. L.A. is a very large and all the tourist attractions are far from each other.

Thankfully it was already 9:30 am and time for me to wake up anyway. When we were leaving, I peaked into a room that the housekeeping staff was cleaning. I was reassured by the thoroughness of their cleaning. They were pulling off all the linens on the beds and making sure that all the sheets were fresh for the next guests. I also got a kick out of the parking spaces. They named each of the spaces after a famous celebrity. I remember we were in the Al Pacino space for the duration of our stay.

If your plans are to see Hollywood and do all the \"touristy\" stuff, this the perfect hotel for you. Its located just behind the Kodak Theatre and the Hollywood and Highland Shopping Center. Its a 2 Minute walk from the Hotel through a side-entrance of the shopping center and you have everythink you want to see right in front of you: Graumann's Chinese Theatre, Walk of Fame, Hollywood Wax Musem, etc. etc.. The Shopping Center provides diverse possibilities to eat and shop. I can especially recommend the uWink bar, where you can order food and drinks and pay and play casual games on a touchscreen display located on every table and also at the bar. The italian restaurant on the second floor of the shopping center also has some really fine food for reasonable prices. If you want it a bit cheaper almost every fastfood franchise is located directly at the Hollywood Boulevard in front of the shopping center. Finally, if you plan to visit Universal Studios, in the shopping center there is a metro station. The very next station (direction North Hollywood) is Universal City. On the hotel: it has a very nice and clean pool that is not very crowded (it was not when I was there on the weekend in the end of August), hotel staff is very nice and helpful, rooms are ok (big enough but a bit old), there is free WiFi everywhere in the Hotel area and also a public PC including a printer.

The most important one, however, is the location. You are seriously 1 street behind Hollywood Boulevard. It takes a short 30 second walk through an alley to get to Hollywood and Highland. Another fantastic thing about the hotel is the free parking. You can securely park your car underneath the hotel which was so handy seeing that you need a car to get around LA. Breakfast is now also included, however when we went there it was always busy and there were no seats to sit at. As we had a kitchen, we just made our breaky anyway. There was also a computer where you could use the internet, you just have to hope that patrons are not inconsiderate and only use it to send an email or to check into their flight.. not to sit on it for an hour and browse (like a few people did). Now for the negatives. Our room was '201' which is RIGHT next to the lift and the breakfast area. It was so noisy it was unbearable. Don't expect to sleep in after 8 because everyone will be banging around. Also don't expect to get to sleep early (9pm) because people were still banging around on the computer or wailing in the reception area. The walls and floors also seem to be paper thin because it sounded as if the people above us were baby elephants (I'm sure they weren't purposely stomping though). We were also next to a really noisy family who would leave their door open and make so much constant noise and slam doors. Also, when they left at 4am one morning, they made sure we heard every suitcase they were dragging around. I had earplugs but I was still constantly woken up. It was so frustrating. So, the location was above fantastic. The rooms were also spacious and a good value for money. However, I would not stay there again if I was put in the room I was because of the noise. I'd request to be put further towards the back of the hotel and away from the reception and breakfast area. I am quite a tolerant person and don't expect much for the money I pay, however it was unbearable and frustrating.

We shared a super king bed (to try save on cost lol!), the bed was a bit uncomfortable - there was a plastic sheet on the mattress that acts as a protector I suppose, every time you move it makes a lot of noise so if you are a light sleeper this is going to annoy you. Location cannot be beat - just through the back alleyway you hit the Hollywood walk of fame, Kodak Theare etc. We had lots of fun coming out several different times of the day to see which character dress ups we could take pictures with. We found a favourite diner, Johnny Rocket, which is located inside the Hollywood/Highland shopping centre. It was apparently Elvis' favourite burger joint! Burgers are priced from $5 upwards, very handy when you want a quick, cheap meal. The pool is very small, but the hotel is not big so I suppose it is adequate. We had fun just mucking round there. Really appreciated the free breakfast every morning between 8-10am. The area gets quite crowded, there are only 4 sets of tables/chairs so we often took away breakfast in paper bags (provided). Breakfast included croissants, muffins, cakes and coffee/tea. The free internet station is also located in the breakfast area, so using the internet at this time is impossible.

We had read the reviews and had high expectations as far as location of hotel and friendliness of the front desk. Neither disappointed. The folks working the front desk are amazingly nice and welcoming - they literally go out of their way to see that you know where you are going and how to get there. I don't think I've ever stayed anywhere where the front desk was that nice. We reserved a 2 King Executive Suite and we were very happy with the size and the price. Not to mention the fact that we had a full kitchen, tons of closet space, and a dining room table that seated four which made it handy for meals brought in. The hotel is an older property, so it's not the Sheraton by any means. But we were really only using it for a launching point to take our kids to Universal Studios and to see the sights of Hollywood, so we didn't need a lot of frills to get by. And the room was exceptionally neat and clean. The carpets could maybe be replaced or get a good scrubbing and I know that grosses some people out. I took socks, because I'm one of those people that can get grossed out, and simply used them to walk around in after showers, etc. But I have to stress that besides that, the room was spotless. It even smelled good, which is some kind of modern day hotel miracle in iteself. The beds are ok, nothing is ever as good as what's left at home, but the kids slept soundly. Our bed was little soft, so that caused some slight backaches, but nothing we didn't get over quickly with a little moving around and stretching. Our suite was nice because the kids had their bed in what would have been a front room in a 1 bed suite, and we had a bedroom to ourselves. It's always nice to have that privacy and quiet. The bathroom was just an average bathroom with a tub/shower combo and toilet. The sink and mirror were located outside the \"wet room\". My husband was so happy because at 6'3\" he could fit under the shower spigot. Towelse were thick and fluffy and didn't have that weird \"washed in old bleach\" smell to them. Our bedroom had a full closet with sliding mirrored doors, and a small entertainment center/dresser. There was also a large coat closet in the hallway and another closet with sliding mirrored doors in same hallway that had shelves for storing shoes, pants, etc. We were all able to hang or put away our gear and leave an uncluttered room which was nice. We did not eat the continental breakfast, although my kids snuck a bagel the 2nd morning we were there. We ate out at the Bob's Big Boy in Burbank (best restaurant every IMHO). We did not use the laundry facilites. The parking in free and subterranean. We have a 2WD Ford Expedition and it barely fit under the gate - if your driving anything taller that 6'4\" you can forget parking there. The only real gripes I would have is that the A/C units in both rooms did not blow true cold air. It was chilly when we were there, but with four people taking showers would get humid and hot in the room. My husband figured out that if we opened the bathroom widow it sucked all that humidity right out of there. Once we got that figured out, it was so nice and cool in our room we didn't need the a/c - but I would be concerned about the temp in the summertime. Also, the tv in the front room/kids room had a short or something and would turn off and on. You had to do some kind of voodoo ceremony over the remote to get it to stay on. It was great entertainment for my kids who decided the tv was haunted - so thank goodness for kids with a good sense of humor! We bought tickets for Universal there and got a $10 discount off the price we were going to pay online. So we saved $40 on those alone. And, just as an aside, we'd read on the forums that Universal was a 1/2 day trip. Well, none of us had every been there and it took us from open to close to see and do everything we wanted to. So just a word of warning for other Universal virgins, it's not quite as easy on time as some might think. All in all, we were very pleased with the hotel. The location could not be beat. The hotel is directly behind Graumann's Chinese Theater and it's a hop, skip, and jump through the Hollywood and Highland mall and the Kodak Theatre to get to Hollywood Blvd and the walk of fame. Once you hit Hollywood Blvd., you are directly across the street from the Jimmy Kimmel Live show, the El Capitan Theatre (plays all Disney movies), and the Roosevelt Hotel.", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mosman, Australia", "Title": "\u201cDo yourself a favour!

Its close proximity to an elegant mall led to some noise at night and in the morning, but this paled beside the incredible convenience of having shopping and multiple excellent restaurants (not to mention Grauman's theatre and its stars' hand prints) only a two minute walk away. Orchid Suites is also very close to a subway stop, which made it possible to take rapid transit New Years morning to the Rose Parade in Pasadena. Staff were generally very polite and helpful (except for one evening clerk who appeared depressed and never cracked a smile). One caveat: our room was on the second floor overlooking the lobby, and the aforementioned clerk's cigarette smoke filtered into our room unless we opened the door to a nearby breezeway. These drawbacks were minor, considering the many positives: free parking, incredible location, comfort, cleanliness.

So we called the frontdesk and asked the lady to just cancel our reservation. When asked why, I politely told her that the place simply wasn't right and I found a different hotel to stay for the night. She was rude and nagged about how we we're spending money at their hotel and we wouldn't even use it.

We have been searching for a hotel accomodation in LA for almost a month. Most of them is either too expensive or too far from any attractions. Orchid Suites is located just behind Kodak Theatre and several minutes walking distance from Metro in Hollywood Highland. I can plan to have a couple of days without renting a car (visiting Hollywood areas and Universal Studios). The room condition is clean but the furnitures are old (Don't expect it is a luxry hotel). I am satisfied with it because it comes with fully-equipped kitchen (with Microwave and Oven). However, I found that the kitchen is a bit smelly but you can close the kitchen door to prevent the smell goes into the room. In LA, you cannot go further without a car. We rented a car for a longer distance travelled and the hotel provides free underground parking which is another advantage over some other hotel in Hollywood. Other merit points including free in-room wifi access, in-room safe and washing machine. For the room rate at around $110 plus tax, I need not ask for more during my stay in the hotel.

We selected it based on the reviews on this site but were very disappointed. The price is OK but the rooms were not what we thought we were getting. We had booked a suite as we were travelling with our two teenage sons. The suite is actually only one bedroom with the second bed in the lounge/kitchen area. We asked for a rollaway bed (as the boys are unwilling to share a bed) and were assured that it wouldn't be too cramped. We found that it was very cramped. The kitchen was very small and did not have a dishwasher and there were no tea towels to dry things. The oven seals kept falling off the moment the oven was heated and the oven door did not fully close. There were no dishes in which you could put leftover food. We were given one room but the moment we walked in we could smell urine so asked to be moved to another room, which the staff did. The carpet on the floor was dirty (as mentioned in another review). Staff did not come in to clean the rooms until around 5pm which meant that we had already arrived back from being out all day and were getting ready for the night's activities. Getting luggage to the room was difficult. One alternative is to carry them up to the third floor or use the lift. The lift is only accessible from the road via the garage. The garage is locked and had to be opened for us and the lift is extremely small so only 1 large suitcase (we had 4 in total and carry ons as we had been travelling round the world for the previous 6 weeks) would fit in, meaning a number of trips had to be taken to bring all of the luggage up.

Hotel staff were extremely helpful and accommodated our request for a quiet room away from the pool area. Unfortunately on Morning One, our shower didn't work properly and water just spurted everywhere all over the bathroom floor. The conceirge came up and said there was a knob missing. He gave us a key to shower in a room on the next floor up. This was inconvenient, but our shower was fixed by the time we returned from Universal Studios later that day. The room upstairs was much nicer and better updated than our room, and while he offered us an exchange of rooms, we prefer not to move once we've settled as we're already staying in 5 hotels during a 3 week stay. Providing we can get some sleep, we can cope with any other little inconveniences. No breakfast was provided, but go to the Fresh and Easy supermarket a few blocks up the road for supplies to make your own breakfast / other meals (the frozen vegetarian selection is outstanding!) The best thing we did in Hollywood was take the Kodak Theatre tour which is right next door. When you are standing on the front steps of the Orchid Suites, look up on your immediate right and see a long glass corridor with yellow paint underneath. That's where the Oscar winners walk past the photos of previous winners after coming off stage to do their press interviews. This tour was the entertainment highlight of our whole 3 week trip to the US (especially walking out onto the stage itself, then taking Johnny Depp's front row centre seat while learning more about the theatre and Oscars ceremonies).This hotel is definitely not the Ritz, but you coudn't get any closer Grauman's Chinese Theatre (we missed the tour there but bought tickets to see a film inside), the sidewalk stars (not the dodgy fakes dressed up as stars who charge you to take their photos!) and the celebrity hand and footprints. The UWink restaurant in the Hollywood and Highlands centre is a bit of fun for a meal (except when 40 drunk male and female 'Santas' arrive right after you've placed your order on the computer screen on your table and get even more drunk while you wait for your meal!)

Booked the stay based on the reviews on Trip Advisor. We wanted somewhere that was close to the main tourist-style attractions, and with easy access to Universal Studios. Our room was a king executive suite, which had it's own bathroom, kitchen and dining area. The most important thing was that the room was clean. The sheets and towels were fresh. Our room was not facing the pool, or on the balcony, but around the corner, facing a car park behind the hotel. This felt far more private, as no one would be walking past us to access their rooms. The safe was a helpful addition to the room, but quite small, which was a downside as we were traveling with a laptop computer. The hotel is located conveniently just behind Hollywood Boulevard and the Kodak Theatre. Tucked away in a private street along with other hotels like the Liberty and Hollywood Celebrity, it is just on the end right behind the Hollywood and Highland Shopping Mall. There was easy and convenient access to the centre at a 1 minute walk. The mall backed right on to Hollywood Boulevard and the Walk of Fame. The mall was useful for places to eat, but we found it tiresome and limited in terms of options. We could not find anywhere that served breakfast, which was very disappointing. We often skipped breakfast altogether because of this. Universal Studios was easily accessed through the Metro station which is underneath the Mall, and people looking to visit the main tourist attractions will be pleased with the location. It's also close the the Hollywood museum, and the Hollywood Wax Museum. The one problem we found with this hotel was that the day we arrived, there were some MAJOR construction works going on next door, on the Mall. Massive drilling noises were VERY intrusive and trying to sleep after a long international flight was near impossible. We weren't warned about this in advance, or when we checked in. The construction was still in process when we checked out. This didn't go on during the evening or early morning, but if you wish to sleep in or have a sleep during the day, you might find it annoying. Overall, though, we found our stay a pleasant experience with no problems. The staff were helpful, by arranging us a cab and letting us know where the major attractions were, and how to access them.

The initial four of which was spent here at the Orchid Suites. And they were a good four days. Unlike the previous reviewer, my experience in check-in was pleasant. We came in late past 10 pm, tired from a 4+ hr. drive from Las Vegas. On our way over, I was worried that our room might be given to another guest so I called to confirm our arrival. The person who answered assured me that our room is waiting for us. Upon arrival, the same man who I talked to earlier greeted us with a smile. Check-in was a breeze. Good start I thought. The last time I was in L.A. was more than a dozen years ago. And my memory of this part of town was that it was seedy. But reading the reviews here in T.A., I found out that the area has undergone a transformation. But unless I witnessed it myself, I had my doubts especially since I was travelling with my 7 & 12 yr. olds. So security was a major issue. I took a chance since I felt that this is the area I wanted to be in. The road where the hotel was located is a real quiet road where nary a vehicle pass. This despite the presence of delivery trucks to the nearby big hotel and mall. The traffic from the surrounding very busy streets of Hollywood, Highland and Franklin could not be heard. One of the things I liked was that upon check-in, you will be given a key (aside from your room key) that can open all the other common doors like the entrance and garage doors which were locked. Safe. The garage is located underneath the hotel and was ample. It was always full but I managed to find a spot all the time. And for those wondering, I saw big SUVs parked with space to spare. Transporting your luggage was easy since there was an elevator. The room was big, generously appointed, and clean. The look won't win any awards and might even be dated and turn off some, but it didn't matter to me. I liked the fact that it had a complete kitchen with a ref, mini oven, microwave, coffee maker and plates and glasses even. You can save money by preparing meals occassionally. A bonus were the mini safe in the closet and the working heater in the bathroom (it was cold when we were there). Service was good. The front desk staff would suggest activities for the day when they see you in the morning (or at least one did). And they were cheerful when answering my daily querries. Aside from the ready answers when asking for a great place for breakfast or a nearby grocery store, they researched and got back to me when I asked sor something they didn't know ( I asked for a nearby church if you must know). And let me repeat the available free wi-fi. You could probably find better accommodations elsewhere. But at $139 a day, it is hard to fault this hotel. Okay, included breakfast would be nice. Would I come back? I definitely would. After my stay here, I brought the family to San Diego and Anaheim, but returned to L.A. for unfinished sight-seeing. But for comparison's sakes, I decided to book at the Hollywood Celebrity Hotel for the 2nd half of our L.A. holiday. Let me state that it is hard to choose between the two hotels. While I liked everything that the Orchid offered, the free breakfast at the Celebrity may be clincher for some. Add that to the fact that the latter is $10 cheaper. But on the Orchid's plus side, you feel more secure in it. Plus, it is a more convenient hotel. This is expounded in my review of the Hollywood Celebrity Hotel. The way I see it, if you have a car with you, the Orchid Hotel might be a better deal. If you don't, the free breakfast and the $10 difference might point you to the Celebrity instead. Personally, I'd put the Orchid Suites in front by a whisker (I had a car). Travelling with my young ones, I like the security and the convenience it offers. Plus the free breakfast the other hotel offers I offset by buying some bread, cereal and juice myself (which is pretty inexpensive). Sorry if this review has stretched out the way it did. Jet lag has given me extra time to write early in the morning (2 am).

Unlike it's surrounding it is a safe area. Prior to check-in, you will be wondering where to park, just stand in front of the garage, there is no real place to unload. After check-in, parking itself is perfect, and safe. If you have any trouble (we didn't) just ask the friendly staff they can help you. Our room was very large, perfect for a long stay. There was even a door to seperate the second bedroom from the front one. The kitchenette was perfect as well, eventhough we didn't put it to use. The room in general is very clean & practical, eventhough it does look a bit dated. The free Internet access worked fine. We did not check out the outdoor pool as it was Winter. Location: The hotel is directly located behind the Hollywood and Highland Mall, a shopping center full of stores and restaurants (Great: California Pizza Kitchen!!!). You walk about 100 meter from the hotel and voila you are standing in the mall. Just ask the hotel staff for advise, they can help you with everything. Universal/Warner Bros Studios are close by, you can either reach them by public transportation or even better by car. The Hollywood Boulevard itself was rather disappointing, it is a very touristy place, but I guess thats what it is supposed to be ;=) Do check out the cinema though, the sound system is amazing. There are two nightclubs open on weekend within the Mall, but the value is rather bad. For the younger crowd it might be nice, they have days with 18yr admission. If you are roadtripping, I would suggest to stay just 2 days here, first for the Hollywood area, second for a Studio Tour.

We arrived on a Tuesday afternoon & made it to the hotel fairly easily in our rental car, thanks to Google Maps. Check-in was smooth & we were able to park our car in the underground car park for free (this is a huge drawcard, as many properties of this nature do not have car parking). This parking facility seemed quite secure. We made it up to our room on the 3rd floor, looking out over the pool on the way. Although this accommodation is aurrounded by buildings (as it is directly behind the Kodak Theatre), it still seemed to maintain a fairly relaxing air about it, with most rooms having their own balcony, & table/cahir set. As well as the main pool areas, there is also a rooftop garden setting where you can see further afield. Our room was a real surprise, with a large bed, TV & lounge chairs, as well as a full (seperate) kitchen & dining area. The bathoom was a little odd with the sink actually outside of the bathroom, although this is becoming more common in many accommodations. The whole unit was fairly spacious although a little dated. However, everything was clean & in good condition. The shower was OK too, with good pressure & plenty of hot water. There was an air conditioning unit in the room although it wasn't that effective for the space it was trying to cool (it was certainly better than nothing). Downstairs (above the lobby) was a free internet comupter, also with printer, which was really helpful, although sometimes you have to wait to use it. Downstairs in the basement there is a laundry facility with a pile of vending machines. The location is fantastic - right behind the Kodak Theatre, it is about a 1 or 2 minute walk to the Hollywood & Highland complex, & just a few more minutes right around to the Hollywood Walk of Fame & Mann's Chinese Theatre. There are loads of things to see in this area so you can get to so much just by walking. Across one street there are some more small stores, as well as a convenience store where you can buy alcohol if you would rather enjoy it in the comfort of your own studio unit. The service was great & we were always greeted at the door. Staying here was a breeze & it was really nice to have full use of our own facilities.

Just go out the front door, up a little walkway to your right, and you're in the Hollywood-Highland shopping complex, which houses three stories of retail stores. It's Babylon Courtyard looks like a Hollywood set, complete with giant elephant sculptures. Viewing bridges at the back of the courtyard offer a great photo-op of the \"Hollywood Sign\". There is a wide variety of places to eat. Our favorite was the California Pizza Kitchen. (The lettuce wraps and the Waldorf Salad were awesome!) One of the stores that we frequented was a Kodak camera shop. Everytime we filled up a memory card, we would have them transfer the photos onto a CD (for $9.95). Take the escalator down to the street level and you're right next to Grauman's Chinese Theatre, the main entrance to the Kodak Theatre (Emmy's, American Idol), a movie theater, the El Capitan Theater (Jimmy Kimmel), the Walk of Fame, the wax museum, Mel's Drive-In, some of the best souvenir shops in town, and so much more! We spent one full day at Universal Studios. It took us about 8 minutes to drive there and park. (By the way, we recommend splurging on a \"Front of the Line Pass\"! No waiting in lines and you get to go \"behind the scenes\" on various attractions). Allow some time for Universal's \"City Walk\" also. There are LOTS of neat shops and restaurants. If you like Italian food, Buca di Beppo is fantastic for both food and atmosphere! If you like seafood, one just can't beat Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. We recommend their \"Bucket O' Boat Trash\"! On a separate day, we made the short drive over to Beverly Hills. Be sure to take the trolley tour around town. It only costs $5.00 and is full of photo-ops!!! All of the staff at the Hollywood Orchid Suites were personable and accommodating! Our favorite was \"Adam\" at the front desk! He really made our day with his wonderful attitude and smile! The hotel itself, as noted in many reviews, is rather \"tired and worn\", but it was clean and entirely adequate for our needs. (Just keep in mind that it is a 40-year-old converted apartment building.) We paid $119/night for a nice-sized room with two very comfortable queen-sized beds, a couch and coffee table, and a full kitchen with dining table. There are, of course, fancier accommodations in the area, but one would have to pay another $100-$200/night. It just isn't worth it, unless you will be spending more time in your room than seeing the sights. One of the main reasons we picked this hotel is because of the security features. Although we were two women, staying alone, we felt very safe here. One must have a keycard to use the elevators, the underground parking garage (parking is free), and the front door \"after hours\". The pool was very clean and warm! The laundry room was a plus. The vending machines had a nice assortment of snacks/drinks. Don't forget to visit the rooftop garden. It's a nice place to relax.

Other configurations are available as well. The kitchen was a real plus--in addition to a full-sized refrigerator/freezer, stove, microwave and toaster oven, it included dishware, silverware (including a corkscrew), a coffee maker wih a daily coffee/cream/sugar setup, salt and pepper and paper towels. We saved a lot of money by being able to buy groceries and take home leftovers, and saved even more with the free parking. The location was great--you can cut through the \"back entrance\" to the Highland Center and be on Hollywood Blvd (and at a Metro stop) in under 5 minutes. A 24 hour drugstore (Long's) and a food market are about 2 blocks down the Blvd. The Hollywood Freeway (101) is a straight shot by car, just a couple of minutes away. There are also on-site laundry facilities and pretty extensive vending machines on the ground floor. The negatives are pretty much what other reviewers mentioned: tired decor (but clean), a shower meant for short people, some outside noise from delivery trucks and passersby on the outer walkways, and some ceiling noise from people on the floor above you (did not detect noise on either side, though).

If you want to go to the Beverly Centre catch the DASH Bus which goes from outside the Metro Stop at 25c it cant be beaten. There are plenty of Museums near the Suites including Ripleys believe it or not and the Guiness book of Records and Wax Museum. The last two i would consider a waste of money as they are in disrepair and quite boring. Another Museum to definite visit is the Museum of Hollywood next door to Mels Diner this is a fantastic Museum the only bad point is you cant take pictures but its probably the best of the lot. Any Questions fellow travellers just ask and i will see if i can answer them.

Located right behind the Kodak Theatre and Hollywood Boulevard, this is the best hotel I've stayed in Los Angeles. At $109/night for two person, we got a wonderful executive suite with a kitchen, which was enough for two people to cook in, and four people to eat in. The room had sliding door so you could easily walk onto the balcony. We had a wonderful view of the Hollywood Hills. Bed is comfortable and a huge King size, bathroom is excellent, and there's a big closet. Hotel has a pool, but we didn't use it, since there's so much to do. Staff: Very friendly and efficient. But my favorites were the cleaning staff. All of them were totally sweet and friendly and very helpful. And they seemed to appreciate to be able to talk to some of the guests. Our room was cleaned and left spotless each day. Location: Excellent, since you can do some shopping very close by and the area is very safe. You can easily walke around at night in the area, but don't wander to far up Hollywood Boulevard. The block aroud the hotel is very safe, up until the Gap there's no worries. And if you plan a trip to Universal Studios, don't take your car, but take the metro, since it's close to the hotel and the Studios are only one stop away. Traffic: This is LA and Highways are terrible. We went to Santa Monica from the Hotel and took Road 66. Major road works, so we got stuck for quite some time. Same thing with the Highways. And if you wanna go to orchid suites coming from Hollywood Boulevard, beware that you are not allowed to make a left turn onto Franklin Avenue at rush hour. I would advice you to turn left onto LaBrea Avenue from Sunset or Hollywood Boulevard and then a right onto Franklin Ave. It's gonna save you a lot of time and trouble. And if you get stuck in traffic. Keep calm and turn up the music! Parking: The hotel has a closed garage only guests can use, so no worries there. Going back home from the Orchid Suites? You have time to spare cause you plane leaves in the evening? No worries, just ask and you can leave you car in the garage. There's table and chairs near the pool.

There was a strange smell in the room when we arrived, but it turned out to be the cleaning products and didn't really bother us too long. The only criticism we have is that the room was a little old and worn out, but that seemed to be LA in general.

We had a kitchenette too. Wireless internet didn\u00b4t work properly, we had to sit on the floor right next to the door to have access (but that didn\u00b4t work all the time). Staff was okay, but not very friendly. The worst thing was the connecting door, our neighbours had some kind of party the whole night, they had loud music first and then talked so loud and screamed and did some other things I won\u00b4t mention here.
