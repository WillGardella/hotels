On arrival we were greeted by lots of pleasant staff, all of which spoke next to perfect English, and were escorted straight to our room where we were offered a map of Paris, a bottle of water and a small box of Laduree macaroons to get us settled in.\u00a0 The room itself was above expectations. I was expecting a small box room by Paris standards, but it was a great size, with a slight view of the Saint Germain des Pres Church, and all the amenities you could want, including comfy bathrobes and slippers, cute little toiletries, lots of fluffy towels, a hair dryer, a nice big wardrobe and easily accessible Wifi. However, I would say the room needed a little extra space for clothes. There was plenty of hanging space but not much else and I found myself living out of my bag a little.\u00a0 The hotel is not huge, but the atmosphere is great. The decoration was very modern throughout, and I loved the selection of hat paintings hung throughout the first floor. The \u00a0corridors and room were always quiet at night, considering that the hotel is just up the road from the bustling Boulevard Saint Germain. We generally found it got a little noisier around 9/10 am when the maids started cleaning the rooms,\u00a0but we were usually getting up by then anyway. There was always plenty of staff at hand to help with a range of queries, and always with a smile. The concierge were all very helpful. We visited the Cirque du Soleil during our stay (which I would highly recommend) but it was a little out of the way so the gentleman went over the best routes to take to get us there and also recommended, and booked us a table at one of the nicest restaurants we had ever eaten in. Hotel Bel Ami's key selling point is its prime location. We were in walking distance to just about everything;\u00a010 minutes to The Louvre and The Siene where there is a convenient stop to get on and off the 'batobus' boat which will take you up and down the river. 15 minutes walk to Notre Dame and Jardin de Luxembourg, with a nice stroll through Saint Germain. 20 minutes to Musee de Orsay, and around 30/40 minutes to the Eiffel Tower.\u00a0 It is also 2 minutes from Boulevard Saint Germain, where there is a huge array of restaurants, bistros and patisseries, including the Infamous Cafe de Flore and Les Deux Magots. And for the shopper in you, everything from Louis Vuitton and Armani, to Zara and Gap, and cheap supermarkets to get some reasonably priced drinks.\u00a0 Check out was nice and smooth. They offered to hold onto our bags so that we didn't have to carry them around on our last day, and they booked us a taxi to the airport at very short notice. We were even invited to have a couple of glasses of champagne at the bar to celebrate our anniversary. There was an additional charge on top of what we had already paid for our trip to cover tax, but it was only 9euros.\u00a0 I would definitely return to this charming hotel and highly recommend it to anybody wanting a lovely clean hotel room in a lovely clean hotel, filled with pleasant staff and right in the middle of everything.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Needham, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cBoutique Hotel--Great Location on Left Bank\u201d", "Author": "happytravls", "ReviewID": "UR119775539", "Content": "The Bel Ami was the perfect place for my daughter and I to stay on a recent trip to Paris.

Not a big deal. Its Paris, remember? Then, on to a very nice hotel breakfast. Truth be told, I have never had a bad hotel breakfast in France, but this one covers many bases for eaters -- fresh fruit, yogurt, pastries, eggs, meats, coffee, juice -- much more than your basic meal. I had this fantasy of losing weight in Paris while walking a bunch and seeing all the smoking toothpicks... oh well. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day -- and that was my SAT exam prep talk. So there. Location-wise, this hotel is perfect. I felt like I could walk out the door and go comfortably in either direction -- preferably toward Laduree... but truly, the location is perfect for someone wanting to feel not so immersed as a tourist, yet comfortable.

The Pro's No-one can fault the fantastic location of this hotel, right in the heart of Saint Germain. Reception and Concierge staff were all excellent - friendly and very helpful. The Con's We had booked a package and were given a room on the first floor. The room was on the small side, but that's to be expected in Paris. However the window was so narrow that the room was really dark - we needed the lights on all the time. Also we were immediately facing the major renovations on the building opposite - so I can tell you that French builders arrive at 7.30am! The housekeeping was poor. I had to ask for toiletries to be replaced when empty, and the box of cotton buds, shower cap, etc was not replaced at all. Presumably you're only allowed 1 for 5 days! We used the drinking glasses on the first day, and although I kept putting them in a prominent position, they were just replaced on the tray dirty! We had a turndown service on the first night, but never again. The quality of breakfast items was good, but the choice was fairly limited. Steer clear of the mini-bar - a Coke was 8 Euros Having looked at other reviews of this hotel, I can only assume that the rooms vary enormously as ours was very disappointing. In my opinion, these basic rooms are very over-priced. I would have rated this hotel much lower if it had not been for the superb location and excellent staff.

The hotel is a bit modern / minimalist and didn't have much atmosphere/personality, but overall it was a pleasant choice. Having researched hotels on trip advisor I was most concerned about not having a bad hotel experience which spoiled the whole trip. As it turned out the room was big to be comfortable, the bathroom had a shower and we had internet access in the room (they also have 3 or 4 computers for internet access in the lobby also). The front desk staff and concierge were polite and eager to help. The breakfast staff were very pleasant. The breakfast is a a buffet with a good selection. Tip: When making the reservation negotiate for breakfast included. We didn't and I recall that the per person cost of the breakfast was high. Bel Ami is in a great spot in St. Germaine de Pres near restaurants. Its near the St. Germaine de Pres church / metro station. 2 tips on the metro for first timers: (i) if you have had a long flight just get a taxi to your hotel - its not worth trying to figure out the metro system when you are worn out; (ii) don't get the metro weekly pass tickets that require a photo. We bought these and went through the gate and were both immediately fined for not having photos (something like Euro 50 each) which was the low point of our trip - it really felt like we were taken advantage of because we didn't know. The Metro itself was a disappointment - my view is the London underground is a better service. You walk up and down so many steps and for such long distances that most of the time you are better just strolling along at street level. For restaurants near the Bel Ami try the \"le Relais de L'Entrecote\" which is about 30 yards from the hotel entrance and across the street - its steak and only steak, with a secret sauce. They keep a second helping on a heated side plate so that you get it hot. Its the only restaurant we were in that had female servers. Right beside the hotel is another restaurant with a green exterior worth a try called Le Petit Zinc - we had a great first meal there but made the mistake of ordering lamb the 2nd night: we now know that the French serve their lamb raw, regardless of how you order it. [Last tip - don't order lamb in Paris unless you like it served with a pulse]. If you don't mind a 10 min. stroll try La Rotisserie d'en Face and Chez Fernand, both on Rue Christine which is a small side street about half way down Rue Dauphine (the road which leads to Pont Neuf).", "Date": "June 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201c5 stars for location, 4 stars for staff and breakfast, 3 stars for room colour, OVERALL 4 stars\u201d", "Author": "CouplefromSydney", "ReviewID": "UR29455181", "Content": "We stayed at Bel Ami in April for 6 nights. We chose it even after reading the mixed reviews because we decided that its location outweighed any of the faults identified by others. We requested a quiet room as we are both extremely light sleepers and mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary, which we were. The room was indeed quiet, and even though there might have been some noisy guests, we heard nothing from 10 pm to 7 am. We definitely did not hear any noise from outside the hotel. To mark our anniversary, the hotel offered us complimentary champagne in the bar (with some nibbles) and because it was around Easter, we got a couple of exquisite chocolate Easter eggs as well. The staff and breakfast were very good. Loved the freshly squeezed OJ and Danone yoghurt. Breakfast included scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, hardboiled eggs, salad, fresh fruit (orange, apple, banana, kiwi, grapefruit etc) pastries and croissants, jams, cold cuts, tinned fruit, tea, coffee, different breads, bottled water etc. Free newspapers were available in the breakfast room. You could get more orange juice if you asked. Grapefruit and apple juices were the other choices. Because we stayed for a while, we did not have to ask for more orange juice after the first day. They would simply offer more. Speaking of orange, the superior room we stayed in was orange in colour...different shades of orange...which was not very pleasing to us from a design perspective, however, it did not affect our sleep. Loved the fact that the loo is separate from the bathroom/shower. Loved the huge bed, too! LOCATION could not have been better. Saint Germain is a terrific area and as we love to walk everywhere, this was the best location. Quiet yet accessible. For groceries check out Champion supermarket on Rue Seine or Monoprix on Rue Rennes. We went to the former. For dinner, we went to the restaurant opposite the pastry shop Laduree -- I believe it is called Pre Aux Clercs or something similar. Would we stay at Bel Ami again? Definitely! It should be noted that we have stayed at MaMaison Sulekova in Bratislava (see review on Trip Advisor) and Hotel Roemer in Amsterdam (we might write a review for this hotel, which we absolutely loved). Oh, and before we forget, the free internet in the Bel Ami lobby did not always work for us, i.e., we could not always access all websites (eg hotmail) on some days and times...a blessing in a way, when you are on a romantic holiday!", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rus", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, don't care for guests\u201d", "Author": "Sviz", "ReviewID": "UR28841997", "Content": "It's a great hotel in a magnificent location, can't get any better my opinion.

This was my second trip to Paris and I spent a fair bit of time researching my hotel before choosing the Bel Ami. I can thoroughly recommend the Bel Ami and found all elements of my stay to be excellent. The Bel Ami is located in St Germain de Pres and its location is one of the major assets of the hotel. You are right in the heart of Paris with great walking-distance access to all the key sights (Louvre, Louvre, Place de la Concorde, The Musee D'Orsay etc.). One of Paris\u2019s most historic bistro\u2019s, Caf\u00e9 de Flore is at the end of the street while a Laduree (an amazing patisserie) is around the corner.. The St Germain de Pres metro station is also around the corner making it easy to access the airport via the train. During my entire stay in Paris I was able to walk to all areas I needed to go without any hassle. The hotel is located in a small side street making it a quiet area with no noise or disruptions. The Bel Ami has a boutique stylish feel about it. Both the lobby and the rooms are very well appointed and there is a comfortable and relaxed feel about the hotel. Check-in was well handled. My room was (as expected) somewhat smallish however this is a given for most European hotels. An intelligent room layout and good use of furniture however made maximum use of the space. My room had a contemporary and stylish feel to it with nice warm colours. The bathroom was spacious and again was well appointed and decorated. The bed was extremely comfortable. Housekeeping did an excellent job everyday and the room was very clean. My room felt very new and was in great condition. My dealings with the staff were minimal- everything was so well handled and run that there wasn\u2019t much need- however when I did speak to someone service was extremely professional and consistent. I found everyone I dealt with to be very helpful and there is a warm yet courteous feel to the service that the hotel delivers. Everyone had good English language skills which was handy as my French is still less than impressive\u2026 Breakfast was nice without being amazing. A cold continental breakfast is served which was ok however given the exceptional range of eateries in the area and the amazing patisseries you have access to, on most days I went out for breakfast. There is a small yet stylish gym with a great fish tank. Complimentary computers and internet in the lobby are a good touch if you aren\u2019t travelling with a laptop. As a traveller I\u2019m looking for a good deal that offers me a great boutique style experience- I\u2019m particular about cleanliness, good food and strong service.

I was travelling alone and it was the best location I could ever imagine. I had a few issues but they would not preclude me from returning. I will tell you the few issues first. The hotel staff was friendly, but the concierge the first day had me get off at the wrong Metro station for the Pere Lachaise cemetery and I walked 45 minutes to get there after I got off the Metro. But it was a pleasant walk! The only other glitch was the a/c, that was leaking water and all they did was turn it off to \"fix it\" . Luckily it was not hot. The hotel is small as are the rooms and bathroom, typical for Paris. But it was comfortable, clean, had modern decor (which I love) and a nice breakfast. There's a small restaurant/bar for a light snack or some cognac. The clientele, when I was there, seemed to be mostly European. The location is so ideal, especially for someone travelling alone. The Metro station at St Germain des Pres is at the corner, as is the famous Cafe de Flore. The very popular Les Relais de L'Entrecote is across the street - they have a set steak menu that is excellent. There are two Jazz cafes and a few other restaurants on the same street. Several other restaurants and cafes are within 5-10 minutes walking distance. Also on Rue St Benoit is UPLA, a wonderful handbag store. I bought a few. Wonderful nylon and leather messenger bags and other styles. Compared to designer bags, they are quite reasonable and different. I have never seen them in the US. Also within walking distance is some of the best shopping in Paris. Countless boutiques for shoes, sportswear, bags, jewellery, paper, etc are all over the place. Le Bon Marche, a beautiful department store, is about a 15 minute walk. They have a unique cosmetic and accessories department. I have never seen so many beautiful scarves. There is also a La Maison du Chocolat near Le Bon Marche where I bought truffles and other chocolates that were superb. The hotel \"arrival gift\" was a box of cookies from Laduree and they were unbelievable. I would never have known about them if I hadn't stayed at the Bel-Ami.

I have stayed here on 4 occasions now, and I have to say, after each visit, I can't help but grow ever more attached to this hotel. However, lets briefly go through the less positive (in my opinion). Cost - Expect rooms to be from Euro 300- 450 per night, depending on season and availability. On top of this, you can add 24 Euros for the breakfast. The rooms are generally small in size, but this is to be expected in Paris. Some of the rooms are showing wear and tear - although I do hear rumours they are re-furbishing! This is good news. For people not willing or able to take the stairs to their rooms, prepare for delays, as the lifts are slow, if working at all (perhaps I am just really unlucky..). When warm, the rooms can get warm - I have never been too impressed with the A/C system. So,on to the positive. I love the location. The St. Germain de pres area is lovely, by day and evening. There are plenty of great shops locally - including Hugo Boss just around the corner, and also Louis Vuitton, practically next door. For food and drink venture out on the street and prepare to be satisfied regardless of turning gauche, or droit. My personal fave is the Alcazar (Conran) restaurant and bar about 10 mins away. Ask concierge for reservation and directions. Simple tasty food, and nice mezzanine bar upstairs. Despite the size of the rooms, they are extremely comfortable. The area is pretty quiet, so sleep is not a problem. Bathrooms are quite acceptable too - and the complementary soaps are actually quite pleasant - although Molton Brown would certainly be very welcome... The bar downstairs near the reception is small, but can be a nice venue to meet with colleagues or friends. The drinks are costly though (get your colleagues to pay!!), and there is not much to remind you that you are in one of the finest cities in the world - so I recommend taking your hard earnt Euros out into the nightlife of the city. There is a small (!!) fitness room, complete with fish swimming in the wall!! Fantastic. There is the option for massage/treatment too, but I have not had the chance so far during my visits. Breakfast is 24 Euros, so perhaps better to pop out and explore the backstreets of the left bank and pick up some Croissants or Pain au Chocolat instead - but if you prefer to eat in then you are in store for a nice mixture of foods, from cereals, pastries and fruits, through to fried delights. The sausages are wonderful. If you stay multiple nights and take your breakfast downstairs, notice how the waiters remember your preferred seating area, and juice variety. Nice touch. Concierge are helpful, and friendly. They always seem to have the right connections to get you what you need, regardless of the lack of notice. I recommend chatting to these chaps. All in all, having stayed at this hotel these 4 times, I would recommend any good friend to stay at this Hotel Bel Ami.

I later figured the room behind the wall was a room service space and the sound came from the staff going in and out, probably with their cleaning carts. the rumbling might've been a laundry chute of some sort? after 9 in the morning there were different noices cause by some construction work or somthing, too. I didnt get the wireless internet to work, could've probably been sorted at the desk but since they had computers in the lobby I didnt bother nor have the need to ask about it. breakfast was included in our rate, it was basic and good, the breakfast room being very nice. what I wondered was why they hadn't placed the bar (just renovated I think) into that location because it would've been next to the street. now it was sort of at the back of the lobby - unoticable from outside and thus empty. the location of the hotel - in the heart of st. germain, was of course great. taxi drivers had some problems knowing it but most recognized the street name or found it on their gps, atleast. staff was friendly, no complaints there. overall we liked the hotel, even though our stay was not as peaceful as it could've been due to bad luck with the room being next to a service room. however, in comparison, we've stayed at equally nice hotels in terms of room size, location etc for cheaper even in london. so that makes me think if its really worh the price, or could some other place be equally good or even better for 50 euros less per night? next time we'll be likely to test some other place.", "Date": "March 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cSuperb hotel\u201d", "Author": "Kr8sus", "ReviewID": "UR6941240", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed in Bel-Ami for two nights in February, and loved it there.
