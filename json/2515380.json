Everything was just fine (as always is with this chain), until we woke in the morning to find that the Toilet was clogged\u2026 Called the front desk, where the guy said \u201cOoo, right now, I\u2019m all by myself and the house keeping\u2019s not here yet \u2026\u201d (was surely past 8am, maybe even 9!)

Now there was no answer from front desk, so I went there. The only lady found at front desk was house-keeping, all by herself said she couldn't leave front desk \u201ccan we use another room's bathroom then?\u201d \u201cNo!, all the rooms are CLEAN!, we can\u2019t have you mess another room\u2026\u201d - apparently she produced the plunger, and hand it to ME, saying \u201cwe don\u2019t have anyone to do it right now\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026.! Some minutes later, there was a knock on the door. It was house keeping, apparently not for the toilet, only she was hoping we were gone so she could clean the room, when I asked her to look the toilet, she tried to use the plunger, but eventually, got things messier and left\u2026 upon checking out, I told the guy at front desk I was so disappointed and complained that they wouldn\u2019t even let us use another room\u2019s bathroom, he wasn\u2019t surprised at all and just said \u201call the rooms are booked, we don\u2019t have a spare room\u201d\u2026 didn\u2019t even offer any apology, apparently, when I shot a sharp look at him, he mumbled to himself \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d\u2026 That day, my husband used the lobby\u2019s bathroom, I didn\u2019t use any at all, (brushed my teeth with a bottle next to the car\u2026) OK, got to make a long story short: in the morning the toilet was clogged, they didn\u2019t send anyone to repair, though were kind enough to hand me a plunger so that I\u2019ll do it myself, they wouldn\u2019t let use another room\u2019s bathroom, and on top of all, they were rude Isn\u2019t it interesting that this was 1 of rare occasions when I did not receive request I useualy do from Choice (or Comfort inn) to fill up a survey about this hotel soon after my stay? theyn nearly always do send this\u2026 I have written to Choice to make a complain, however, never received any respond at all\u2026", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Novi, Michigan, United States", "Title": "\u201cGood value in North Seattle\u201d", "Author": "Robert A", "ReviewID": "UR125764136", "Content": "I stayed here for a business trip.

The rooms are good size, with microwave and fridge. Comforatable beds and the rooms are clean, nice bathrooms with remodeled sink and tubs. The carpets are a little older and probably should be replaced soon. Rooms are quiet. Get an upper floor with downtown view - nice. The furniture is a little old, should get new tvs, But they include a dvd player with the tv, so bring your movies.

The front desk staff was helpful with every request and question. The check in process was the fastest and smoothest I have ever experienced. She got thru the usual spiel and we had key in hand in and were headed to our room in under 2 mins yet she was polite and not hurried at all, just orgainzed and thourough. The lobby is clean, it has a microwave in it ( not needed as our room had one) as well as coffee tea and hot choc always availible free of charge. The room was a 2 queen with a pull-out couch, non-smoking room although a previous guest had decided not to follow the policy and there was a faint smokey smell. I think it was more noticable to us because US cigs smell way different than Canadian cigs, but we opened the window and in no time at all the smell had dissipated. I asked the front desk to insure the chambermaids left the window open the next day, and she made note of that, AND had them spray nutrilizer in there - it was not a problem after that! The Rooms were clean but housekeeping did not take the dirty coffee mug and plate from our breakfast back when they made up the room - not a big deal and the only thing that stuck out as being less than perfect the whole weekend The furniture was nice both in the room and in the lobby it looks like it was updated not that long ago. The bathroom was small but fine. But I found it odd that the bathroom door faced the beds - not what I am used to, most hotels I have been have had them at a right angle to the door of the room. Also the sinks are in the bathroom which meant if someone was 'going' others could not be brushing their teeth or whatever. With a big family I prefer the sink & vanity out of the bathroom but that was certianly not a deal breaker The Breakfast room is tiny as someone mentioned but the Huge selection of food more than made up for it -and REAL, MADE BY YOU waffles....YUM! The Breakfast staff was very on the ball and nothing ever ran out. The money one can save on the free breaky makes this a real plus. Definaly one of the best parts of the stay There is a ton of parking - including some covered parking and I felt safe leaving my van there at night. The drive to downtown is a good 10 mins BUT the route is simple and I actually felt safer being a bit farther out. Its in a commerial neighborhood, but it was a nice location. And because we planned to take advantage of the Fridge and Microwave in our room we were pleasantly suprised to find a grocery store 1/2 block away. There also seemed to be a nice selection of resturaunts nearby. Free Internet usage on the lobby computer, which is not something I usually worry about having in a hotel but a few times over the weekend I needed to look up something and it ended up being a great convienience.! No Pool, Small but suffiencient hot tub off the lobby. Room key card to activate the elevator was a pain in the butt, but I guess it's added security. All in all it's not 5 star but for the economy price range you get better than an economy hotel.... but ask for a top floor room so you dont have to hear the neighbors above you flush the toilet while you are trying to sleep!", "Date": "September 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spokane, Washington", "Title": "\u201cBetter than Expected\u201d", "Author": "Rowse", "ReviewID": "UR20146701", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for two nights on September 14, 2008.

The parking was a little tight, but we were able to find a spot at 1:30am. Only minor complaints I have is that the bathroom was a little small and the walls were paper thin.

Parking is free. The parking lot can be dark at night. The hotel is located on Aurora Ave and right next door to Sam's Club and some car dealerships are down the street.
