This is an awesome location if you intend to enjoy the attractions around Hollywood. One block from the walk of fame on Hollywood Blvd, Sunset Strip is steps around the corner. Santa Monica and Venice Beach a 20 min drive. The Hotel is a little dated but love the look and feel, kind of a villa feel with a central pool which is lit up in cool alternating colors at night, secure gated parking underground. The price for us was the big draw, as my wife works for Choice Hotels and we got a deep discount. Now for the not so good. The pool is always dirty. Six days into our stay (out of seven) and We have yet to see anyone clean or swim in the pool (it is directly outside of our door and window). On our second day we asked about the pool finter running, said our 10 year old would like to swim, was told it always runs but is silent. Never once saw any water movement at all. Took some pics of the debris on the surface. Gross. House keeping comes in once a day, changes bedding empties the trash and cleans the bathroom. They haven't vaccumed the carpet once, have knocked at the door at 930AM asking for towels for laundry (???) and have stopped and looked into our windows to see if we are in. Breakfast bar was small and crowded, that's fine. My wife asked about some 2% milk because it was emty and was told to use the skim dispenser, since they fill them all with the same milk regardless of how it's labeled. err ok. At one ponit the toilet was clogged, wife called the desk and they said \"The plunger is outside the door from the office to the pool area\". We went and got it and plunged our own toilet. The free WiFi works but VERY slow at .31mbps. TVs are HDTV but the satellite service is apparently not. Very low quality picture. We would actually stay here again because of the low, low rate we get. If paying full price we'd find somewhere else to stay.

The price was very reasonable and we had an open mind about a non-4 star hotel, especially during a crazy Christmas weekend. Even though we arrived 2 hours before check-in, we were allowed to park our car in the underground parking lot, which allows entry only with a hotel key card that the desk clerk gave to us early. Therefore, we did not have to pay for a parking garage in Hollywood while taking a tour bus during the day. Check-in was very smooth, and we liked our nonsmoking room very much. There were some recent renovations to the room- wall hangings and bedding on the more neutral side, brand new 2.7 cubic foot fridge, brand new flat screen Vizio, and microwave oven. Perfect for storing our road trip snacks and some leftover gourmet burgers from the 24 hour joint in the Roosevelt Hotel, which was also a few blocks from Quality Inn. There was also a coffee maker and a hair dryer. The breakfast nook was amazing. Available from 7-10am, there was a variety of choices such as cereal, mini muffins, croissants, toast, and of course the make-it-yourself waffle iron. It was very nice to get coffee and a solid bite to eat- which saved a lot of time and money before embarking on more sight seeing. Yes, it did get crowded, but if they served some doughnuts + coffee and called that continental breakfast, the breakfast nook would not have been nearly as popular. To address some shortcomings mentioned in other reviews: the the area is a little weathered, but it was a short enough walk to tourist central. Plus, there were many restaurants very close by for those who prefer to walk for all budgets. The pool was not maintained but in December, I didn't think anyone would want to take a dip. After all, this is not the Hilton where you can swim in a heated pool and soak in a jacuzzi. Since there is no elevator, I'd suggest that you request a first floor room if you are booking for a person who can't handle stairs. The underground parking lot is kind of cramped, but for the larger SUV's, there is parking right outside some of the first floor rooms, so no need to fret. For the price you pay in an area where you can walk and not pay for parking-- we were very happy with our choce. The tax was a bit crazy, but it's not the hotel's fault.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverside, California", "Title": "\u201cUnderrated, To Say The Least.\u201d", "Author": "tsmoore88", "ReviewID": "UR121021080", "Content": "My fiance and I stayed here while we were in Hollywood for auditions and I have to say I was pleasently surprised with this place.

Of course sketchy characters are going to be out late at night- it is Hollywood after all, it's like the old saying goes \"Nothing good happens after 10 o'clock at night\". During the day you see the area for what it is, a working class neighborhood that is bustling and not even the slightest bit offputting to those who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth. The market across the street is nice with fair prices, just do yourself a favor and miss the Burger King located near by, try the excellent Subway a few blocks down the street. I never tried the pool but it was closed from the public and for the most part private. Breakfast was awesome and the dining area is quite nice with lots of large windows for prime people watching.

We decided that we only needed a base as we would be out most of the time, and after reading the reviews thought this hotel would be okay for that. We have also stayed in Quality Inns before and always found them to be good value for money and very good budget hotels. The day we arrived, we had just left a beautiful hotel in Las Vegas and it was quite a shock when we arrived at the Quality Inn! The location of the hotel is not the prettiest. There is a lot of traffic in front of the hotel, some worn-out looking shops across the street and a few homeless people were sitting on the sidewalk. The outside of the hotel is pretty run down and painted a horrible shade of yellow. The promotional photographs on the hotel website do a good job of disguising this! After checking in and hauling our luggage up the stairs, the rooms were okay. Very dark and a bit run down but everything you need and the inside of the rooms were clean. We were due to stay for 5 nights but our initial thoughts were that we would stay one night and then try and get our money back and re-book elsewhere. After a very disappointing start to our Hollywood stay, we ventured out and soon remembered one of the reasons we had chosen this hotel. After just a few minutes walk we were on Hollywood Boulevard and all the famous landmarks were in sight. After our first night, which was a little noisy but nothing you wouldn't expect in a city, we headed down to find the breakfast room. The room is on the small side and there are not always seats available, but there was a good choice of food from cereal to freshly made waffles. Very convenient and a great money saver. On consideration of the amount of time we would actually be spending at the hotel (very little), we decided to make do and not try and change hotels. The great location saved us lots of time and money as we didn't need to take the car and as the room itself was clean, in the end it was fine. One issue which was quite annoying was that there are no safes in the room. You have to take your valuables down to reception and they place them in a safe deposit box. Although you are given the key to keep, the boxes are in a room at the back of reception and you can't actually see them which was a bit worrying. Also the parking is a little strange. As our hire car was quite large, we did not attempt to use the underground parking garage as the entrance was very narrow. There is parking at the side of the hotel but you have to choose your space carefully as there is a chance you may get blocked in overnight by the cars parking on the street. Overall, this hotel is fine for a cheap base in Hollywood which you don't plan on spending much time in. The location is really good once you get past the immediate surroundings and the rooms are fine. It is not the most attractive hotel and looks very run down from the outside. The pool area is not very inviting and we did not use it. If you are planning on spending time relaxing at the hotel, don't go here but if you just want a clean room to sleep in near the Hollywood attractions then it is ok but if we ever return to Hollywood, I would want to pay a bit more to stay somewhere nicer.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cDo not stay here\u201d", "Author": "E-Manny", "ReviewID": "UR119084843", "Content": "This hotel was horable and dirty.

Myself and my wife are not picky whatsoever, we see a hotel as a place to rest our heads while we explore the sites of the city we are visiting - all we just ask for is that the hotel is clean; something which the Quality Inn was certainly not. I've read a number of reviews on the hotel before writing this and I am shocked that there are some people out there who have made positive remarks regarding their stay. I have to say this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in (and just to note I have stayed in a few bad ones). When we first arrived we were met by a homeless person who seemed to be having his dinner from the hotel's bin - which certainly set a precedent for the week ahead. The hotel's reception area is grotty and the pool area should be cordoned off because I cannot believe anybody should be allowed to go in there because it looked absolutely filthy - during our stay there I did not see one person attempt to go anywhere near it, which on reflection was a wise decision! When we entered the room we were met with this awful musty smell, and this was with us for the whole week, and I am sure it is still there now ruining some other poor couples' holiday! The pillows on the bed were stained, the carpet was filthy, the bath was unkempt and had hairs in it, the surfaces and light shades were covered in dust - do you want me to go on? I appreciate what people were saying about the staff being friendly, I do not dispute this, but every time I brought an issue to their attention all I received was a glazed look from them and a half hearted response that it would be resolved. However, I could tell straight away that these matters wouldn\u2019t be addressed; and they normally weren't. Just to reiterate, I wasn\u2019t making any outlandish requests, I appreciate this was a budget hotel - we just wanted to stay in a place which was clean and habitable. Unfortunately, I cannot provide you with comments on the breakfast, as given the standard of the rooms we did not dare go anywhere near the food. I don\u2019t want to just be providing completely negative remarks; the location of the hotel was good. It was a 2 minute walk from Hollywood Boulevard and a short distance from the Sunset strip and a 10/15 minute drive from Universal Studios. I never write on these types of forums normally but given my experiences at the Quality Inn I had to come on to advise everyone against staying here.

They had free breakfast every morning which there was always plenty of food available, (Even for late morning sleepers like us) they had your basic breakfast food, and the lady who ran the hotel made waffles. There were lots of convenience stores around, and a Target down the way, so if you forgot anything, you didn't have to go far. The hotel allowed smoking in the rooms and our room definately smelled like smoke. Other than that the room was clean, but very modestly decorated, like I mentioned no frills.

When I complained, the night manager was useless. I ended up having to resolve the situation myself, and the jackhammer was finally put away at about 1:30am. The next day was ruined. When the night manager was unable to deal with the situation, I called the 800 number for Choice Hotels, and they only person to talk to was a reservation agent. This concerned me quite a bit. What if there were a real emergency going on? This chain--which includes over 6000 hotels--has no one at the corporate office to handle emergencies at their properties in the middle of the night?!?! Now, I understand this jackhammering wasn't a true emergency, just a big inconvenience for me personally. But, the fact that there was no one but a reservation agent available concerns me, and I doubt I will ever stay at a Choice Hotels location again because of it. They will take your reservation/money in the middle of the night, but not deal with problems. Afterwards, the company went through the motions of customer service following my complaint without actually providing any actual customer service. They sent me a personal email and made a phone call about a week after my stay, but didn't seem to understand the situation. They gave me an extra 3000 points in my \"rewards account\" for the trouble, which is basically worth nothing. The location was good and the bed was kinda comfy, which surprised me.

The refrigerator was cold enough to freeze a soda we had in the door. The furnishings appeared to be well kept and there were no problems with cleanliness.

The Cons: Rooms are small, and furniture is oversized. We were in a king sized room and the space between the bed and other furniture (entertainment center, table, chair) was probably less than 12 inches. King bed is too big for the room. Got a peek inside a double bed room and we kind of wished we would have gotten one of those since they appeared to be more spacious. Rooms are dated. Walls are a little thin. It's a Motel.

There is some parking along the side of the hotel, but the spots are narrow. There is parking underneath, but those spots are narrow too and hard to get into. Not the place to bring your monster truck. But then, this whole part of town is not the place to bring your monster truck. The streets are narrow and traffic is busy. Some reviews complain about the seedy nature of this area. I would more describe it as colorful. It definitely has character. I think these people were more struck by the dissonance between the glitz and glamour implied by the word Hollywood and the reality of what Hollywood is. It's an old part of a major urban area. It is beaten up by the years and it shows its age. But hey, you travel to see interesting places, and this is one of them. However, the hotel is not a reflection of this dilapidated character, and is in fact well maintained and feeling like a retreat from the gritty chaos outside.

We arrived again in January 07 and were amazed to see the name changed on the hotel and all the Holiday Inn stuff covered up. We asked at reception and were only then informed that it was no longer a Holiday Inn Express hotel. They were unhelpful and would not give us a contact number for Holiday Inn customer care. We decided to stay as we knew this area now and it is one of the best locations for exploring Hollywood and always felt very safe. Also, a different hotel at this late stage would have cost so much more. We had got a good deal over the Internet for an advanced booking. The first room was unsuitable because of electrical problems but the second room was better altough not quite the standard of the previous year. The maids did not clean quite a well as previously either. There was less of a supply of soap/shampoo etc also. The breakfast bar did not have the same selection of food and one day, we even had to ask at reception for some bread! However, since then it was better attended to. The staff were unfriendly at first this time but most cheered up a bit as time went by. The last night, we had very noisy guests next door. It seems security even had to intervene. The hotel were understanding and allowed us a discount because of this which was okay. When I returned home, I contacted Holiday Inn Express customer care and they say it is up to the hotel itself to inform people on the booking list that the place has changed hands and offer them the choice to cancel. It is not Holiday Inn's responsibilty to deal with these people. It is a warning to others who pay a little more for a brand name because this could happen to anyone and your position is a little vunerable when you are in this mess with no prior warning.

I've definitely stayed in worse (in LA, especially). First off, great location. Our room was clean and plenty big enough. I liked the fact that the underground parking garage was gate protected, but the ceiling was so low that I thought I was going to scrape the roof of our subcompact! Plus there was only one gate to get in/out and there was a hill you had to go up/down while hoping no one else was coming in/out at the same time as you were! The dial on our fridge was broken so it froze all our water and fruit! But that was our own fault for not complaining on day one when we realized it. The continental breakfast was less than stellar. Although the cinnamon rolls were delicious, everything else seemed as if it had been out too long. It also really disturbed me that they had milk sitting out at room temperature! And there was a fly caught in the breadbox the second morning we went there. Plus the staff lady that was in there had a foreign program turned up really loud on theTV and kept burping while we were trying to eat. Ew! So after two mornings of that, we decided to splurge on breakfast out the rest of the week. I think one of the biggest problems we had was that the last few mornings we slept in, and every day they would call our room around 11am to ask if we wanted room service (even though we had the Do Not Disturb sign out)! It didn't really occur to me until the last day when the call woke us up. It just seems really rude, especially in a party town like LA to wake your customer up every morning when they didn't ask for a wake-up call! And don't even get me started on the internet connection. it NEVER worked between 10am and 10pm every day. I was blogging my visit on my website and I would have to upload pictures and post my blog in the middle of the night because that was the only time the connection would work.

The decor is strictly early 1970s, semi-colonial and a little too beige for my comfort. It has individual wall air-conditioning which was difficult to calibrate and loud. I felt like the area, while slightly low-rent, was completely safe. One person mentioned the Burger King next door. That should tell you something about the neighborhood which is right on the corner of Sunset & La Brea. The free broadband connection was via ethernet, but it was very fast and easy to connect. The free parking is tight, as reported by others, and if you have trouble navigating an SUV in a suburban parking lot, you might want to consider a smaller car here. Overall, it was cheap, convenient, but a little depressing. And did I say that the parking and internet is Free? That saves you 30 buck a day right off the top.

Hotel includes a simple but more than adequate continental breakfast and staff were helpful.", "Date": "May 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ostend, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel for a good price\u201d", "Author": "Yves", "ReviewID": "UR3317605", "Content": "Hey, I stayed at this hotel for about 5 nights. The location is quite good. Not that far away from hollywood blvd and the touristic stuff. The only minor thing is the traffic in that area. I had a room at the sunset blvd side and that was pretty noisy, especially the first night since i'm used to sleep in a quiet area. But i got used to it pretty fast, maybe because i was tired too :) Every morning i got my free newspaper and breakfast (oh i really like those cinnamon rolls...) . In the room they have free internet access and i must say i really was surprised i had a microwave and fridge in my room, which is pretty nice. That way i could save money on eating out ;). Staff is very friendly. e.g. on my last day i asked some info about getting to the airport. The guy at the counter was so friendly to make reservations for a cab and he said i could check out at noon instead of 11 am since i only had a flight 3 pm. Not that big a deal, but it's the details that make it worth while sometimes. I'm from europe and i've been in pretty small rooms in hotels (e.g paris and amsterdam). The rooms were spacious in this hotel with a very nice bathroom and shower. So i think this is an ideal hotel if you don't want big luxury but some comfort for a good price. greetings, Yves", "Date": "April 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, would definitely stay again\u201d", "Author": "CaptainTongo", "ReviewID": "UR3211421", "Content": "On the corner of La Brea and Sunset it is well situated for tourist places such as The Walk of Fame.
