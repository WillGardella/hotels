It was unfortunate that when we were there the hotel lobby was in the process of updating, but the staff was more than accommodating and pleasant.

Small as you'd expect in NYC but upscale, comfortable and contemporary. We particularly liked the bed and bed linens. Bathroom was reminiscent of small hotels in Paris where we've stayed. Other than the staff possibly the best part is that you walk outside your door stroll half a block to the treats at Eataly (a reason in itself to go to NYC), we took in a wine tasting (divine), and then two don't miss parks short walks away (one at the end of the street and the other two blocks south on Broadway). Surrounded by great restaurants we took in a few including Pipas at ABC (short walk from the Wyndham) and ABC Kitchen -- new for us and wonderful as well.

I\u2019m almost hesitant to give this hotel a great review, because selfishly, I don\u2019t want it to become so popular that I\u2019m unable to book it myself the next time I\u2019m in NYC :) In all seriousness, though, this hotel deserves a great review. There are so many awful hotels in NYC \u2013 run down, old, ugly, dirty, uncomfortable and all of that for a disgustingly expensive rate \u2026 but this one is actually a diamond in the rough. The hotel is located in Chelsea, right near the famous Flatiron building. It was a perfect location for me, as it was only 3 blocks from where my business meeting was, but it may be a bit far for tourists, depending on what area of the city they want to be in. Regardless, the subway is never too far away in NYC, if walking isn\u2019t an option. The building itself is rather small and narrow, but it\u2019s brightly colored and modern looking. Each floor only has about 8 rooms, so it\u2019s not a huge hotel by any means; it felt more like a boutique hotel, with the benefit that it\u2019s operated as part of the Wyndham chain (a bonus as far as quality, and loyalty programs). There is a restaurant next door which provides meals and even room service, and there was a small patio out front for dining and drinking. There was also a small reach-in cooler with snacks and drinks for purchase in the small (but bright and cheery) front lobby, with an internet station for those who need it. I had a room with a King bed on a mid-level floor, facing the back (not the street). It was a small room (typical of NYC), but I was pleasantly surprised at how clean and updated the room was. The large bed was very comfortable, with lots of pillows and a nice cushy down coverlet. There was also a comfortable work desk with complimentary wired internet (almost unheard of in NYC!) and 2 small complimentary bottles of water (nice touch!), a flat screen TV mounted to the wall, a small safe in the nightstand, and a stand-alone wardrobe, which had iron/ironing board and coffee/tea making machine inside. The bathroom was updated with modern fixtures, it had nice soft towels, a hairdryer, and \u201cTrue Blue\u201d bath amenities by Bath & Body Works (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, mouthwash, 2 kinds of soap, shower cap and \u2018grooming kit\u2019 \u2013 an impressive array for a mid-range hotel). The hotel was surprisingly quiet (or, I just lucked out and had quiet neighbors), and I thought it was in a good part of town. I was even pleasantly surprised that about an hour after I\u2019d checked in, the front desk representative personally called up to my room to see if I was happy with the room, and if there was anything else I needed. She also reminded me that the temperature control was on the wall rather than on the device by the window (which was nice, as I was just trying to figure that out!). The air-conditioning is really just about the only \u2018negative\u2019 thing I experienced in my stat at this hotel \u2013 and it\u2019s really not something I\u2019d grade the hotel too harshly on. I couldn\u2019t get the room to a comfortable temperature at night; the room was either too hot or too cold. That may have been an issue with the thermostat, but considering all the other good things about this hotel, I didn\u2019t really want to harp on that. The room rate was a little high (ok, a lot high) for my personal preference if I had been on a leisure trip, but it was on par for what I\u2019m willing to pay for a business trip. Overall, this was a great find, and I will definitely try to stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cTop-notch service, excellent comfy rooms!\u201d", "Author": "united07", "ReviewID": "UR118760329", "Content": "We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and had a smooth check-in.

Every few minutes it would swich off then come back again. I think it was an air con unit for the adjoining building. I wanted to sob. All we wanted was a quiet room.

The hotel is rather small with only about eight rooms per floor so there wasn't very much staff required but they were always around and all of the employees were very friends and just made the experience a very good one. Another bonus for us was that the hotel does have a shuttle service that takes guests to the airport if they need to get a ride, unfortunately there wasn't a shuttle service at the time we needed one but the woman at the concierge desk was very happy to reserve a private car for us.

Such \"busyness\" also lends itself to some frustration. The two elevators are routinely in service (often by cleaning staff), resulting in long waits up and down. If your room is on a lower floor, you'd be better off taking the stairs. Also, housekeeping tends to work well into the afternoon and early evening, leaving towels/sheets stacked or piled in the hallways and stairs throughout the day. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal, but when exiting the elevator, there isn't a lot of room in the hallways to maneuver. The room itself was fine. The flat screen TV was a nice feature, and the work area well lighted and comfortable. The only downside (and one to be aware of) is that my room--on the 5th floor--faced out to the street.

If all the Wyndham hold the same amount of friendly service, I will make it a priority to stay at these hotels. For this trip, I initially tried to book a room at another Wyndham location and since it was full, the website redirected me to this location. For NYC, the price was right. Even on a long weekend (easter), they let us have a reduced rate (which I had found a coupon for online). For anyone who knows how expensive NYC hotels are, this was great for us. Our online price quoted (with taxes) was the exact same as when we checked-out. The location of this hotel is very well situated, between 5th and 6th Ave, at 24th street with two different subway line within a block distance. We walked all the way to statue of liberty one day, and another day, up to 96th street, halfway up to Central Park. Having our hotel right in the middle of Manhattan was great as all the neighbourhoods are easily accessible, even by walking. Keeping up with NYC\u2019s style, the lobby, the elevators, the gym and the rooms are all very small but they all serve their purpose. We arrived to NYC at 11am and were given a room instantly at no extra charges. We had been told ahead of time that we could leave our luggage with the front desk while we went sight-seeing if a room wasn\u2019t ready when we got there. We were given a room with a king sized bed on the 4th floor, with a window facing the front street. There was a flat screen TV on the wall, a small chair, desk, closet, a safe, an alarm clock, two phones and a full bathroom. We never heard any sounds coming from the hallway, neighbours or streets. The bed was very comfortable and the room very clean. 20 minutes after our check-in, the front desk called us to ask if everything was good and if we required anything else. Throughout our weekend, the front desk asked us if we needed help finding our way around, suggestions to restaurants or if we required shuttle service to the airports. Very nice personal touch that we appreciated. We parked our car on the streets (for free \u2013 it was the weekend) and didn\u2019t have a problem. I know the hotel does have parking for a fee though\u2026 We also were able to flag down a cab within a minute on 5th or 6th avenue at any time of the day or night and the subways come by very often.

The location of the hotel was great, just twenty blocks from Times Square and really close to the shops of Fifth Avenue and Broadway, so we were able to walk virtually everywhere or pop back to the hotel during the day to drop our shopping bags. We were greeted on arrival by a very friendly staff member who checked us in quickly and easily, before directing us to our room on the 14th floor.The room was a good size, especially as it contained two double beds, which were extremely comfortable. There was only one window which didn't seem to allow much light into the room, and strangely, apart from one small ceiling light just inside the doorway, there didn't seem to be any other ceiling lights in the room, so we resorted to having to switch on the two lamps provided. The room could have been cleaned slightly better before our arrival as there was some dirt on the carpet, but generally, the room was cleaned well each day during our stay. The bathroom towels and bed sheets were changed every three days, unless requested sooner by ourselves. The website stated that there was a safe in each room, which I had planned to use, as I had taken my laptop with us. However, after searching the room, we were surprised to find this missing. We mentioned this to the staff on reception, who asked us to check the room again, and if we still could not find the safe, he would arrange for one to be put in the following day. We checked the room again and informed him on the same day that there was no safe, but this was never brought to our room. I resorted to putting all my valuables back in my suitcase each morning and locking it when we left the room. We also had recurring problems connecting to the free wifi. The staff on the front desk were unable to help, but gave us the telephone number of their central technical support whom they informed us would be able to help instead. They were able to assist us, but the internet speeds were extremely slow once we were connected. On departure, the hotel concierge booked the shuttle to get us back to the airport. Firstly, the taxi bus arrived twenty minutes late, and secondly, the driver was extremely rude, only spoke basic English, and drove very erractically (even more so than the average yellow cab driver). The shuttle had already collected several passengers from other hotels and we were the last. Our suitcases were loaded onto the top of the pile in the boot, and when the driver braked sharply after yet another near-accident, all of the cases slid forward, falling onto the seat in front. Luckily, there was nobody sitting here, otherwise I fear a serious injury could have occurred. We both agreed it would have been a far more enjoyable journey, had we stood on the street and hailed a cab. If I was to make a return trip to New York, I would consider staying at Wyndham again as the price was very competitive, and generally it is a very nice hotel.", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Goteed1", "Title": "\u201cGood Choice For Budget Stay in Chelsea\u201d", "Author": "Goteed1", "ReviewID": "UR79710138", "Content": "Stayed for 5 nights and would echo all of the positive comments in previous reviews.

On first impressions the hotel looked small, but was in a great location and seemed to have very welcoming staff and nicely furnished heated rooms (it was freezing outside!), comfortable beds and a clean and tidy looking bathroom. However, after the first night, we started noticing major problems. The main one being the air conditioning in our room randomly turning itself on every half an hour through the night and loudly blasting out very cold air for about 30 seconds despite the fact we kept turning the whole thing off. No one sorted this out for us and it was a persistent problem throughout our whole stay. Coming in from the cold we were greeted by blasts of icy air! The heating and the air conditioning were built into one so needless to say it was very cold in the room sometimes, which conidering the temperature outside wasn't pleasant. On about the fifth night the generator for the air conditioning (which was very close to our door in the corridor outside) started humming very loudly and we could hear it through the door. Again, this was another problem no one came to fix. The generator itself was dusty and was creating an odd smell in the corridor. It was obviously linked to the problem we were having in our room. We seemed to feel extremely lethargic and unwell as soon as we got back into the room which made us wonder if there was something wrong with the air being filtered into the hotel. We felt fine at all other times apart from when we were in the room. There was definitely issues with the air quaility. The sheets on the beds seemed too small for the actual bed, which was itself huge and very spacious. The lack of adequate bedding coupled with the icy air being directed at us from the air conditioning didn't really help us have restful nights sleep. The housekeeping was quite poorly done and didn't have a lot of effort put into it. At a quick glance it looked fine - we always had fresh towels and a clean bathroom and the beds looked made. I say looked made as on several occasions we pulled the duvet back to find all the sheets underneath still crumpled up and messy from how we'd slept in them the night before. We also found clothes under the sheets that had oviously just been covered over quickly and tucked under the duvet. On the plus side the hotel was in a nice quiet street and was about a 20 minute walk from Times Square. The Subway on 23rd Street was really useful and the location of the hotel itself coupled with the Subway made everything very accessible. It is very close to the Empire State Building and a good shopping area on 5th Avenue. The hotel reception staff were very pleasant and always greeted us as we went past and on our last day they were happy to look after our cases until we left for the airport. They also provide an airport shuttle service for $20 per person. I'm not sure I'd stay here again.

(I know its our fault for having so much luggage, but shopping was so good in NY!!!, BUT that's still no excuse for the missing bell boy). Stepping into the small lobby, we were a bit put off by how hectic it was. Lots of people crammed into a really small lobby space with two receptionist multi tasking like crazy was not a good sign. Took about 30 minutes before they could find my reservation. Even had to call up Expedia to double check with them. After that, its another 20 minute wait for our rooms to be available...UMMM isn't the check in time suppposed to be at 3? It's 4.45 now!!! Reason: It's new years day. Wtf. I would've been super pissed if it wasn't for the friendliness of the receptionist. She was so kind to offer snacks and drinks from the little bar fridge in the lobby free of charge. Since there is no Bellboy, we had to push the damn cart into the tiny elevator that takes forever to move. It got to a point that other guests had to help us push the cart into the elevator. Then we had to slowly unload the luggages one by one. Same thing when we were checking out. NO BELL BOY!!! Went downstairs to get the cart, take it up, load my luggages on it, and take it down. Oh and the best bit, reception can't call a taxi to the hotel. I had to go get one myself!!! As the hotel is located on a quiet street, I had to run down to an avenue, cross the road, and actually hail a taxi to drive to the hotel. I have never heard of this and find it utterly ridiculous!

The hotel is on 24th Street halfway between 5th and 6th Streets (a little closer to 6th), just one block over from the major cross-street in Chelsea, 23rd Street. There are subway stations all along 23rd street. The closest to the hotel is the FV station at 6th Avenue, but the 1, RW, 6 and CE stations aren\u2019t far within \u00bc mile. The location of the hotel is its best feature. There is quick access to all parts of the city. But Chelsea/Flat Iron is full of interesting shops and incredible restaurants. We walked to all of these restaurants\u2026 we had breakfast at Murray\u2019s Bagel (on 8th Avenue south of 23rd Street), had the best BBQ brisket ever at RUB (on 23rd Street between 7th and 8th Avenue), had an excellent European brunch at Markt, enjoyed incredible soup at Pipa\u2019s inside the ABC Carpet Shop on Broadway, indulged in old fashioned diner-style meals at the Lyric Diner on 3rd Avenue, and even sipped shakes at Burger Shack in the Madison Square Park. The area has really fun for people watching. The hotel is obviously newly re-constructed. All the materials and fixtures are new. There is essentially no lobby. The doors open right at the front desk. There is a sofa and a couple ottomans but it\u2019s not a spot you would spend time. A ticket desk/concierge is squeezed into a corner. The restaurant is supposed to be a part of the hotel, but it didn\u2019t really seem that way. We never ate there. Room 903 is steps from the elevator and faces the front of the building. The small room was adequate for two people who travel well together but don\u2019t think of sharing a room with someone who get\u2019s on your nerves. It has a desk and chair, big flat screen TV on the wall, arm chair, two nightstands, a luggage rack and a closet equipped with an iron/board. There is no dresser. The king sized bed has a good quality mattress topped with a comfy feather bed. The sheets are good quality (probably 350-threadcount). The duvet and comforter are nice and cozy. The pillows are decent foam. The heating system was a little quirky; it made a lot of noise whenever it kicked on. But we got used to it and slept through the repeated ruckus. The bathroom is well equipped with a good-sized shower, decent towels, enough counter space and True Blue Spa soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. The water pressure and temperature were good. Except one morning there was no hot water. By the time we went down to the lobby, the repair truck was already parked in front of the hotel and they were repairing the frozen boiler. We had plenty of hot water when we returned that afternoon. Our room was cleaned completely and promptly when we\u2019d leave in the morning. Although no one knocked when we had the do not disturb sign on the door, the cleaning crew was very noisy. Two of them even got into a screaming match about who wasn\u2019t working fast enough! But everyone on the staff was very friendly to the guests. The hotel worked for us because we don\u2019t need a fancy lobby, an onsite restaurant or other services. It was a good value for the price compared to other hotels in Manhattan. It is in an area that we like and has good access to public transportation. If you travel like we do, you\u2019ll like this hotel.", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harrisburg,PA", "Title": "\u201cSmall cozy hotel in West Chelsea\u201d", "Author": "mumbai_da_munda", "ReviewID": "UR52042105", "Content": "The hotel staff is excellent and so is the concieragee.Got some valuable tips from the concierage that helped us in our sightseeing.

One of the problems we had was a lack of any places to set anything down in the room (other than the floor). In the entire room, we only had one small nightstand.

No desk or safe in the room although they are listed as amenities on the website. They did deliver a safe to go in our wardrobe when we requested it.

Front desk was extremely polite and helpful, and assured me that, although my room would not be available till 3:00 p.m., the hot water would indeed be back on by that time.

For those who want to eat at the hotel, I think the breakfast bar serving Starbucks and pastries at the front desk is the only option, but trust me there are lovely delis and diners to try minutes from the hotel. Delighted with our stay in the Wyndham Garden and will certainly consider again when back in New York.

Very close to the subway line, Flatiron building and Madison Square Park. The room we stayed in was small but we only used it to sleep! So much to do in NY! A few comments for management would be: The bathroom could have been a bit cleaner, not sure the floor was cleaned before we checked in. When we asked the front desk about help with getting tickets to a Broadway show we were just told to \"check the internet\" A little more help, tips or ideas would have been nice. Lastly, a street/subway map of Manhattan would have been great. Most hotels give these out but the front desk only seemed to have a map of the Flatiron district. Over all a great stay here and would definitely recommend it to others as well as stay here again ourselves.", "Date": "May 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Summerfield, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cOk if you get a good price-I Did\u201d", "Author": "CaribbeanKelly", "ReviewID": "UR29939594", "Content": "Rooms are a little tight, but have all the basic nessecities.

Our king room was big enough - fit a desk and chair and comfy chair without a problem. And we didn't need to move anything to walk around the bed. Unfortunately, they got dragged down by cleanliness. We had to ask for our room to be vacuumed ... from the previous tenant. And I'm sure it was not vacuumed daily. It really was close to perfect, but lack of good cleaning staff/policies really drags it down. I am clinging to the idea that these are teething pains, because I loved so much about it.
