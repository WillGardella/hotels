The only places that are too far are Statue Of Liberty and Ground Zero but this was only 13 dollars in a taxi which is nothing. The Hotel service was great, right from check in they were polite welcomed us well and even called up to the room 10/15 minutes after getting up there to make sure we had settled in ok and was there anything we needed. They were always happy to help with directions and recommendations of eating out or which attractions to visit. Other reviews have said the lifts are noisy, however our room was next to a lift and we didn't hear it! In the day when you were up you could hear it slightly but once asleep it was not loud enough to wake up! and i am a light sleeper. Room was perfect size, perfect views and had a nice big TV in. The King size bed was so comfy! We had heating and air conditioning in room however didn't need to use this at all as the room was a perfect temperature! Breakfast was lovely, lots of choice however it was very busy in the mornings and was only a little conservatory where we could sit. We were quite lucky and always got there just before the rush, but others would come down and have nowhere to sit! I can't imagine what it would be like in peak time. The Free WIfi was great as it meant we could get touch with family back home and not have to pay anything to be able to text and ring to another country! Also very impressed they had a workstation area with 2 computers and printers meaning we could check in online before our flight home and print off our boarding passes.

A few great extra touches that I wasn't aware of; I had a room only rate but was pleasantly surprised to find complimentary breakfast for ALL guests every morning. Consisted of juices, tea, coffee, bagels, pastries, bacon and omlettes. A complimentary all day coffee and tea bar with take away cups and lids was very handy and I would take one every day I ventured out to experience the city. The hotel also provides for fast and free wifi. There is no laundry however you have free use of the laundry (washers and dryers) of the candle wood hotel which is right next door.

Bathroom is a good size, clean and has basic shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer and hair dryer. The room is serviced daily and kept well. This hotel is great for those that are interested in exploring all that NY has to offer and then come home to a comfortable, clean room.

We were based on the 30th floor and had no issues or problems with getting up and down with the lift. We found breakfast to be tasty and plentiful with a vast selection. We had made a decision that if the breakfast was not up to much we would dine out. However the breakfast exceeded our expectations. In addition there was complimentary tea and coffee and fruit juices avaliable at anytime of the day which was handy. It saved havibg to use the coffee maker in the room. I had read about warm cookies avaliable and can confirm that these cookies were in reception during the early evening and were truly lovely. The hotel is situated between 7th and 8th Avenue and gave plenty of choice for dining. We didn't like time square in the evening as the restaurants were busy and it was mass produced convenience fast food. However just by the hotel is an area called hells kitchen which has numerous restaurants to try out. We tried several and each were as good as each other. On the day we checked out to return back to the uk we were given the choice of keeping our room for longer or havibg our luggage looked after which allowed us to have an extra day in new York before our flight home. The hotel arranged our transport back to JFK and it made a lovely surprise to be greeted and taken back to the airport in a limo. My husband and I would definitely stay with the holiday inn express if we go back to new York but more importantly we will now consider this chain of hotel in other destinations.

Located one block from the Port Authority Bus Terminal, and three blocks from the array of restaurants and entertainment venues on 42nd Street, this hotel is a great value and is within an easy five minute walk of Times Square. While the room itself was compact, it wasn't too small, and considering the pricing at other hotels that may have had bigger rooms, it was fine. One doesn't come to NYC to sit in the hotel room anyways ! The complimentary breakfast on the main floor was plentiful, and there were always at least three or four staff refreshing the supplies and cleaning and straightening up the breakfast bar, and chatting with the guests to ensure that they didn't need anything. The pancake machine was a big hit, not only as a novelty, but as a food source. If you come down for breakfast within the last 30 minutes, yes, you may have a hard time finding a seat, as other posters have said. I came down for breakfast each day at about 8 am and at least half the seats were empty at that time. There is a business center in the lobby with two computers and a printer, that can be used by the hotel guests. The hotel also has wired and wireless internet in the rooms. The hotel has only two elevators, but that only seemed to be a slight inconvenience at breakfast time - it did sometimes take 5 minutes to get an elevator at 8 am, but once there, the elevators were very fast. The hotel is very tall and very skinny. Seriously, I think the hotel itself is probably only 50 feet wide. On my floor, I think there were only six or seven rooms. The hotel appears to be almost new, I would guess about 2 years old. If you are leaving the hotel and taking a cab, I would suggest that you walk down to the corner, to catch a cab, as opposed to catching it right in front of the hotel. Unfortunately delivery trucks etc. sometimes temporarilly blocked 39th St, meaning that you sit in a cab with the meter running, not going anywhere. (That happened to me twice - nothing to do with the hotel, just a suggestion to save you money.) The hotel manager could be seen each morning visiting with guests in the breakfast area, checking to make sure the stay was enjoyable. The manager was very friendly and it is obvious that he and his staff truly do care about their guests - I travel a great deal for work (92 nights last year), and it was refreshing to experience a hotel with that much hospitality and care about their patrons.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cDoes all you want for the price\u201d", "Author": "tomgem_lond", "ReviewID": "UR121590072", "Content": "We stayed in the hotel for 5 days, and had no problems at all.

The breakfast is pretty good, with a 1 minute pancake machine, coffee/tea, hot and cold self-service choices. Plus it's a buffet, so you can eat a good breakfast to set you up for the day.

You have to walk up the street even to catch a cab. I would not have let my granddaughter out of my sight for anything.

Beds were very comfortable and rooms were clean. We were very happy with the free WIFI and free breakfast every morning. There were a lot of choices for breakfast and we always left the hotel very full and ready to hit the pavements. There was also a computer at the ground floor for guests who did not bring their computers with them. Front Desk and Concierge staff were friendly and ready to help for any queries. There was an Italian restaurant just across the hotel which served very good food and was recommended by Lonely Planet. Also a sandwich bar just around the corner for quick bites. There are a lot of restaurants near the hotel for diverse choices. It is quite a walk to Times Square though but location wise, it still gives you value for money. Only problem we encountered with the hotel was that the elevator would get quite full during the breakfast rush, we would just sometimes use the stairs because the 2 lifts would not be enough to accommodate all the guests. My advice would be either to take breakfast very early or late just to avoid wasting time by waiting for the elevators. All in all, we were happy with the hotel and would recommend it to anyone who will ask.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beirut, Lebanon", "Title": "\u201cLoved It !!!!\u201d", "Author": "alineLebanon", "ReviewID": "UR114724430", "Content": "The hotel had a great location, close to Broadway ans many restaurants and pubs.

The Circle Line boat dock and the Intrepid Air and Space Museum is also an easy walk to the river. Three blocks over and five blocks up. Cabs are plentiful and inexpensive. The hotel has 35 floors and only six rooms per floor. It is very tall and thin. The rooms are rather small but still comfortable. We had two adults and two teens and managed just fine. Room is missing a safe, which would be nice. Bathroom is great and no problems there. Night noise is very little and sleep comfort was good. We could see the Empire State Building from our window. The staff are great and answered any questions we had and called around for reservations and offered tips and suggestions readily. The breakfast room was always fully stocked and very clean albeit a bit small but we always got a table. The staff there were always bringing in fresh food. Lots to eat and a decent selection of hot and cold items. Being very tall and only six rooms per floor the elevator could get a little busy and was crowded, but that was minimal. Would stay at this property again in a heartbeat. We felt safe and secure at all times and didn't feel nervous walking from Times Square late at night, which BTW stays open very late.

The good: central location meant we walked plenty even though our feet ached at the end of each day! Found some great restaurants nearby, Thai Select just a couple of blocks away on 9th is great and there's a great Italian place also on 9th (cant remember the name) where the staff were very accommodating. The breakfast was a great start to the morning, for all those worried about the elevator queue getting downstairs just take the stairs!! All day tea and coffee was great. Staff were friendly, when we requested more towels the front desk called few mins later to confirm whether they had arrived yet. The bad: Room is small and it was a bit of a tight squeeze for three of us, particularly after we had done some shopping! Bathroom was clean but little space to put our toiletries, however we worked around this so it was fine. The room was equipped with an iron and hairdryer - however when we contacted the hotel prior to travelling we were told they didn't provide them so ended up taking both with us. On the last day we asked for a set of scales so we could weigh our luggage - lots of shopping im afraid! Initially we were told they were elsewhere and then finally we were told they couldn't find them. It would help if the breakfast items were labelled, some are clearly obvious but for those with specific dietary requirements a few labels would certainly help!

Our room was adequately sized with two double beds, as big a room as one can expect in NYC for the price. The hotel is as clean or cleaner than any other HI Express in which I've stayed. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The front door is locked late at night and is in direct line of sight of the front desk clerk. We felt very secure. Because it was a weekend, the breakfast room was very crowded around 8:30 am but the complimentary breakfast is worth the wait in view of NYC prices. All in all, ours was a very pleasant experience.

Not too familiar with NYC, I was relatively unsure what to expect with the hotel and it's location. Building up to the trip I had several email communications with Hassan (Front Desk) & Hunter (GM) regarding room reservations, dates, and bed types. They were both extremely accomodating and punctual in their responses which made the planning a very easy process. With our friends flying in from England to surprise my wife I was nervous that the surprise would be ruined upon check in, however, the Front Desk girls on duty were well aware of my situation (credit to Hassan/Hunter) and were extremely discreet. Our rooms were perfect - clean, modern and comfortable. The hotel staff that we encountered were very friendly - breakfast crew, Front Desk and housekeepers. Not expecting much from the complimentary breakfast I was surprised by the choice on offer: bacon, sausage patties/links, scrambled eggs, omelets, breads, bagels, cereals, pastries and fruit. This was perfect for our group to gather in the AM and plan the days events on a full stomach. I was even more impressed with the all day fruit juice fountain machine and selection of teas/coffees that were available to guests at any time - a welcome amenity after a long day exploring the city in the cold weather. The hotel was about $35 away from LaGuardia in a cab including tolls and gratuity. The Concierge arranged our transfer back to the airport for $20 each sharing a shuttle with another couple. I would definitely recommend this to other couples as some of the cab drivers refuse to go to the airport at certain parts of the day (4pm shift change in our case). The hotel's location on 39th street was ideal. A 5-10 minute pleasant walk to Times Square attractions. Subways to all the Manhattan areas were not far (even in the cold weather) - alternatively for groups of 4 or more, cabs are a lot easier for relatively the same price as the subway.

When we came down to eat nothing was left but awful white toast and watery coffee. The dining area looked like a very run down Mc Donald's. Not something you want to see on the first day of your vacation. The staff told us they were out of everything so we skipped the dry toast and had breakfast at Le Pain Quotidien instead. I have to say that the room was very clean, nothing wrong with that, but the elevator, staircase and breakfast area were in need of some refurbishing.

Anyway, the night before we were to leave, she came up with the solution to leave the plunger in our room for us to use in case it clogged up again.

On the positive side, they are clean and properly equipped; I slept well. The biggest problem, and this is major, is that there is only space for 2 elevators, each of which struggle to fit 8 people. With luggage, that means 5 or 6. This is nowhere near enough. I was on floor 30. In the morning, about 9:50 AM, I finish packing and walk out to hit the button. 3 minutes later, a full elevator arrives. Another 3-4 minutes pass after I hit the button again, and the second elevator is full. Now worried about being late to a tour, I carry my suitcase down 30 flights. I make the tour, but my knees hurt. Remember, there are only 6 floors above me. What would someone on floor 15 do? Wait an hour? In a competitive market like New York, there are better options. You could walk around the corner to the Staybridge, for instance, which is generally cheaper, has larger rooms, and 3 larger elevators. Or you could book the Candlewood next door.

He informed me the hotel contracted with a private car company and I could take one of their rides for $45 - a rate that included all tolls and gratuity. I was skeptical since I had heard these rides were a scam, but he assured me this company was affiliated with the hotel and trustworthy. Since $45 was around what I was expecting to pay in total for the cab and I confirmed with him THREE times that this was a flat rate, I agreed. Not five minutes into the ride was the driver attempting to get more cash out of me and saying that the $45 did not include toll fees. Unbelievable. I persisted and refused to give him any additional money but it really left a bad taste in my mouth.

Best of all, my two favorite amenities: a free, well stocked breakfast, and free high speed wifi. Here's what is less than perfect: small rooms, hardly any shelf space in the bathroom, and it's not really at Times Square but a half mile walk past the bus terminal and down a rather grungy street. But I'd walk that walk any day for the user-friendly amenities at this hotel. I notice comments about the elevators. I stayed on the 34th floor and never had to wait more than 30 seconds for an elevator. The building is interesting - apparently it contains 3 tall and thin hotels side by side, which is why there are only 6 rooms to a floor, and why - at least for my stay - 2 elevators can do the job in a 36 floor hotel. As for value, I had a great rate from a discount website, and if the Holiday Inn's rack rates were twice that price, it would get 5 stars for value. Unfortunately, they are considerably more. At $300+ per night, the small rooms and somewhat gritty neighborhood would be harder to overlook, but for a reasonable discount the HI-Express is a hidden gem.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOK in NY\u201d", "Author": "TheEnglishTourist", "ReviewID": "UR75127323", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel for three nights at the end of June.

The hotel is very new and clean. The beds are comfortable, it seemed to be very quiet, and the complimentary breakfast was wonderful (and a cost saver in NY). There was also free wireless internet which was nice. For us, the location worked, however, we also like to walk a lot - I could see where some others may not like the location. It is very close to Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, and the bus depot. There are also plenty of restaurants and shops in the area. However, it is a little misleading to call it the Holiday Inn Express \"Times Square\" as it is not in Times Square but actually quite a few blocks over. (We actually ended up being thankful for this though b/c I think that is why it was quiet there.) That being said, you can walk to Times Square and the theater district in about 10 minutes, or to Central Park in about 20/30 minutes. So it really depends on how much you want to walk (or take public transportation). Other than that, my only complaints would be small ones - the room was smaller (but that is kind of expected in NYC), and it was hard to regulate the temperature both on the thermostat and in the shower. The hotel itself was pretty small - only about six rooms on each floor - but very tall (about 40 floors).

New York is a city re-visited after 32 years. I read the latest 10 reviews before I write so as to keep a more impartial view on my experiences and those vacationers'. The hotel should acknowledge that the front staff fail to give a consistent and regular hospitality service to all at different time and days. I had both carrot and stick in my four night stays. While Roger impresses me with his prompt and casual and easy going manner, some are still keeping a busy, don't-care-less attitude. The A/C system is the best of all amenities. The lighting cannot provide good night reading condition though I admit that westerners would prefer romance to practicality. Toiletry is sufficient for daily use save the absence of glass for rinsing. Those plastic cups are too small. We cannot complain too much about the elevators. This building may not be for hotel accommodation in its primary construction, and nothing the hotel can do to speed up lifting. Without space for another service lift, both staff and guests should pardon each other for inconvenience and mess. If not, the best solution is to demolish it. By the way, this is HI Express. I know what I would get, and I would where the location should be by the name. In my home city, the HI Express is housed in a brand new building for 2-3 star accommodation for back-packers, tours, family holiday-makers and solo visitor like me, adjacent to Times Square, a shopping magnet for all tourists and the local. But this is New York. I believe I get the best value with what I pay though I do have complaints. The continental breakfast is not 'continental'. It is quite 'New York', providing choices of food and varities close to a full breakfast. And it is complimentary! Try those continental breakfasts in Europe and the UK, and you understand why I am so grateful to what I can eat for my breakfast. The hotel even provides instant oatmeal in addition to cornflakes of three kinds and chilled yogurt. So, give concession to crowdiness. Provide spacing for each other. Be less selfish and less dominant. I saw a lady not giving way to a long queue unless she finished toasting ten slices of bread and two English muffins using the one-and-only-one toaster for 4 slices at a time. (why only one? I scratch my head to work out a reason) Yes, about something missing: I also lost my sachet of bath treatment the next day. The maid might have considered this a trash, but the sachet is unopen in its original packaging, and it should not be mistaken as an abandoned object. I wrote a very polite memo to advise the maid to return it to me, in case they found it somewhere. The note was on the table unattended. English? They may understand English, but can they communicate with guests well? I spent usually one hour in the quiet late morning to check and send e-mail, in the 'business centre' next to the staff laundry room, and I had not heard a word in English every time I was there. All staff there speak their own native language in a joyful, reckless and care-free manner which I hope I can have a share. I understand that the basement is their territory, but it is a space in New York, and their working time should not be taken for granted as their own free time.

TIPS ABOUT NYC: I took the Super Shuttle from JFK in to the city. NEVER again! From the time that I landed until I reached the door of the hotel...4 hours! A taxi with the $45.00 flat fee is the way to go if time is valuable to you while in NYC. I had great difficulty getting a cab back to the room and to JFK. Literally 5 cabs wouldn't take me back to the room (not because I'm sketchy or smell bad either! :-)). They wouldn't take me because the fare would have been to low. However at midnight after a day of walking and being alone I wanted to take a cab, COULDN'T get one off the street. I did go the the Marriot Marquis in Times Square where they have a cab line. It was only then that I was able to get back. The subway is the way to travel, in my opinion, while in NYC. It was FULL of tourists and some locals and was VERY safe. I got to WTC in 10 minutes, back to shopping on Canal St in 3, back to Times Square in 4. All for $2.75. If you are going to WTC there are two different commemorative sites. One a museum and the other a small gift shop type place. St. Pauls Church accross the street is chock full of history (George Washingtons Pew for example) and also has a lot of 9-11 rememberances. Within Times Square is an old converted theater dedicated to Times Square called the \"Times Square Guild? Consortium?\" They were very informative and offer Broadway shows at face value. TKTS TKTS booth does not sell tickets to Jersey Boys. It sells out every night. INCREDIBLE show. A must see and not a bad seat in the place.
