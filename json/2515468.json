The location was excellent, about 3 blocks from the Gaslight Quarters where there are hundreds of restaurants and shopping to choose from. The young lady at the front desk, Jackie Burkett was exceptional. We wanted a high floor so that we could get a good view of the bay and Jackie was accommodating to say the least. She asked us our reason for visiting and we told her we were celebrating an important anniversary. The room was lovely, very clean with the most comfortable mattress and bedding. We had an LCD 32\" inch tv in the room. The bathroom was a bit small but the double headed shower head made up for that. Every day near the elevator there was a basket of green apples. The elevators were awesome, with the glass all around and being on the outside of the building when you were going up you could see everything on the Bay, especially nice at night. When we arrived we left our suitcases in the room and went out to scout the area. When we came back there was a beautiful strawberry plater, gift and card to congratulate us on our special anniversary. So thoughtful and unexpected. I would not suggest using the self parking for $24.00 but instead use the Valet for $32.00. Everytime you go in and out of the parking they charge you by 15 min increments, so if you plan to go in and out often better to just go with the valet parking. I asked for an Irish coffee at the hotel bar late in the evening and they didn't have coffee, but went over to the restaurant and got me coffee and made me my drink. Went over and above. The hotel restaurant is a bit pricey but with all the restaurants in close proximity that is not even an issue.

That's it. Also, San Diego does not allow wine to be delivered to your room after 11pm (what!?). The Westin San Diego's bar closes at 11pm BUT their web site says 12:00pm close time.

On New Year's Day Thi (pronounced 'tee' - a lovely young woman) helped me personally by allowing me to stay on the line to British Airways for a very long time (and many other passengers too). Eventually Thi 'saved the day' for all of us by speaking to a supervisor/manager and insisting we be given accurate information and be kept informed (everything was conflicting info before this). Thi was instrumental in the passengers being bussed (around 4 pm) and eventually being taken to LA for a flight the following day to Heathrow - arriving into the UK on January 3rd instead of January 1st! Thi took everyone's names and made sure the list was checked and anyone who'd gone for a walk and hadn't returned to the hotel in time for the bus that eventually arrived (only due to Thi - no BA representative ever appeared) was told how to get themselves to LA.

Pretty much walking distance to everything. The hotel is also very clean and the beds were very comfortable. It wasn't crowded at all so checking in was a breeze....I sometimes even wondered if there were any other guests staying at the hotel?! A couple of things bothered me though. Realizing how close the hotel was to the train depot, I knew there would be a lot of train and trolly noise throughout the day and nights. I had specifically requested a room that was facing away from the tracks, but was given one that was facing the main street (Broadway) so could hear the train horns very clearly at nights. The next day I just decided I wasn't going to bother requesting a room change as I'd already unpacked everything and had settled in. Another issue that bothered me was that I had called the Westin reservations number to enquire about a lower rate I found on their website (where I had originally booked my room a few weeks earlier). The reservations guy told me that I had pre-paid my hotel stay and that that he could try give me the better rate. He couldn't access the system to do anything that evening so suggested he send the hotel a message to assist in making this adjustment upon my check in. At check in I mentioned this to the guy at the reception, but he said he didn't see any message and subsequently summoned another guy, whom I'm assuming may be the manager. He did a little checking and informed me that they never received any message from Westin reservations, and besides, my booking was pre-paid so there was no way it was changeable. This is not what the reservations told me, and I've known of other instances when they would give the best rate possible even though the room was pre-paid. They were polite about this, but didn't seem too friendly, but it was late and I didn't want to bother arguing about it. I would stay here again only if I was sure I'm getting a very quiet room as requested. I wished the hotel would have paid more attention to these little details as it's stated right on there with the reservation, and it definitely makes a difference to the guests to know that the hotel cares.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery elegant, clean, and efficient way to travel.\u201d", "Author": "GQ_82", "ReviewID": "UR121859725", "Content": "I thought everything was GREAT, EXCEPT for the girl at the front desk when we checked in....

The staff was wonderful and made everyone feel as they were the only guest in the hotel.

About the hotel: From the first, all the Westin staff were fantastic! Be aware that there are two Westins only a few blocks apart. Not reading the address carefully, I arrived at the other Westin -- the staff there offered to cab me to the correct Westin, but being a nice day, I wanted to walk. A staff member walked with me, suitcase and all! At the correct Westin, the staff throughout the hotel were fantastic with every interaction every day for all 5 days and nights. My stay was marred only by a large noisy party next door to me on Saturday night. The hotel staff did their best to quiet the group, and eventually, just before the last chance before eviction, the group quieted down. There's no way to know that a group in a hotel will be inconsiderate...but it is nice to feel supported by the hotel staff in attempting to control the situation. The hotel location was great -- just about 4 blocks to the water and in direct line with the ferry to Coronado. Just 2 blocks to the trolley station. For those who enjoy walking, a brisk 25 minute walk brought me to the convention center. At the hotel, the bar has a great happy hour (4-7 pm) every night with good appetizers.

I don't care if they only give you 30 minutes, but they should tell you that!! - the bathroom door wouldn't stay open unless propped with something, and since there was no fan in the bathroom we had to use a shoe to prop open the door after showers. just not something you expect to have to do at a nice hotel - the ironing board was covered in some specs of dirt or something. got my nice white shirt dirty before I noticed - the gym.

I should not have been worried. Of the two hotels, the staff at this hotel was the better of the two. From the valet to the bell person and everyone in between, the staff was exceptional. We were down in San Diego for my son's first birthday (zoo trip!) so we had a lot of \"gear\" for him. The bell staff was extremely helpful in getting everything out of the car, bringing it up to the room and helping us get things like ice to keep his food cold. The valet staff also was very gracious in retreiving toys from the car that this dumb dad forgot.

We were on a Preferred Guest floor and the views of water were amazing, especially at sunset and daybreak. There are only two slight drawbacks which prevent me from giving it 5 stars. First, the room, while an acceptable Westin room, was not as updated as other properties I have been in. To whit, there was no minifridge. There was a space in furniture for one. Second, it is slightly on the outskirts of downtown. Granted it is not a far walk (or a cheap taxi) to the Gaslamp district, it is farther out than the other Westin at Horton Plaza. If you don't walk to walk far, Karl Strauss brewpub is a short stroll up the street from this hotel. A great option for either a business traveler or a family guy.

Service was top notch, everyone was very friendly, gave out great tips for places in the city. My family all loved the fruit flavored waters in the lobby, it was very refreshing and coming in to the hotel after a long day was instantly relaxing, it's a beautiful building. Very happy with the rate I got on Hotwire (and I dont think we were punished by that rate with our room choice, we had a great view). More than anything though I can't say enough about what a perfect location this is for exploring the city on foot. You go a couple blocks west and you are at the bay and it's boardwalk, can see all kinds of interesting ships and aircraft carriers. About 10 minutes walk north of the hotel is Little Italy which had some wonderful authentic restaurants and gelato and is worth checking out. Two minutes walk from the hotel is Karl Strauss which if you've had a long day and dont feel like walking is very close and a cool very good place to eat (their mac and cheese choices are great). and about 10 minutes west of the hotel is the gaslamp district with great restaurants and good architecture. Took us about 15 minutes drive to get to coronado beach and less than 10 to the zoo. Seaworld was about 20 minutes away, farthest drive we had while there. Never having been to the city this is a perfect place to stay and walk around. The Bad: 1)Valet Parking. $32 a day, they will justify this by telling you this is the standard for the city. Then they will drive your car across the street to the clearly marked $15 a night lot (really, stay and watch them do it, it's very insulting watching you pay an extra $17 a night for someone to walk a hundred feet). It will actually take you less time to park your car in that lot than to have them walk over to get it and drive it over to you. I saw quite a few Valet options walking around the city and they ranged from $10-$15 so I'm not sure when the last time they checked out what the standard was. 2)Prices in general for anything else. The buffet is VERY overpriced for how simple it is (good but something like $25 a person for bacon, eggs, hashbrowns. maybe 8 different things to choose from).. Still charging for wifi that most hotels include these days (even those charging much less to stay). The parking I've already mentioned. I know there is a slight premium to staying at a hotel but it was definitely overboard and there are plenty of choices to avoid it once you know the city even less than 5 minutes walk from hotel. 3)Dream bed. We had our kids so we had two doubles. I don't know if you dont get the dream bed with two doubles I'd be curious to find out if thats the case. But if that really was the dream bed then it's very disappointing. The sheets were nice but the bed was pretty hard to sleep on. The dream shower however I loved. That said the positives very much outweighed the bad, we had a great time here and I would recommend it to anyone as long as they understood to never eat here or pay to park here.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jersey City, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel with walking distance to Gaslamp Quarter\u201d", "Author": "RajSip", "ReviewID": "UR116539332", "Content": "Enjoyed a very comfortable stay with family at The Westin in San Diago.

We decided that myself and son would come down a few days later to enjoy the weekend in San Diego and take our son to Legoland. I am a Travel Agent. I do my research on hotels very thoroughly. I have been in this business long enough to know that there are some times where bad things happen, and one review is just one review. I am hoping that our experience was just a fluke and won't happen again. But we were HUGHLY disappointed in the Westin San Diego. Enough to know that I will not be staying there again and I will not put any clients there! I did like the location. Very close to a lot of things. If you are looking for a nice family place, I'm not sure this is the place for you. The pool is small. Only goes to 4 feet. Our son could spend all day in the pool if we were to let him, so the 4 ft pool was a little disappointing for him, but is something we can deal with. Not a big deal for me. Rooms were nice. Our room had a pocket door that separated the tub & toilet from the sink and the rest of the room. I noticed that the pocket door was only half painted. Like when someone went to repaint the room, they didn't bother to take the pocket door off the hooks and paint it fully. They didn't even bother to shut the door all the way. So there was a good 2 inch spot on the right side of the door that was a completely different color. A few times, our room wasn't made up until we were on our way to dinner. The thing that topped it off was on our last night, Saturday night. We had gone to Legoland, spent the day there. Came back and had a bad dinner at one of the local restaurants. We were tired, cranky and wanted to just get a good nights sleep. Came back to our room at 10:30pm. We noticed that the room right next to us had the door cracked and there was a party going on. At 10:45pm, my husband called down to security and told them about the noise. Security came up and told them to quiet down. We fell asleep until about 3:30am, when something woke all of us up. It was the banging of doors as people went in and out of the door and into the East Stair Way. They were SMOKING in the stairway! In a NON-Smoking Hotel!!! Again, we called to Security. In the morning, we went down to talk to them about our bill. They charged us $20's more than the rate we thought we were getting because my husband added me onto the room. Ok ... even though I wasn't there the whole time, we decided to pick our battles and just pay the extra $100's that we weren't expecting the room total to be that much. My husband also brought up about the 2 times that we called security to have them come take care of the party next door. Not necessarily to get compensation but just to bring it to their attention that we did not pay $200's a night to stay at a nice hotel to hear a party and smell smoke all night long! That is when the little customer service that we already had been dealing with went out the window. They started to say that there was NO record of any noise complaints all night. We were just dealing with one of the girls at the front desk. She kept going back to ask her manager what to do. The manager approved her to take $40's off our bill (very nice and we would have been happy with just that) and as she did that, she completely IGNORED my husband as he asked her other questions. Wouldn't even look at him \u2026 dead stare at the screen. My husband then asked for the manager on duty. The manager came out and proceeded to argue with us that because there was no reports on the security log that we were lying. My husband even told the manager the conversation the security guard had with the people in the room next door, and that he should be able to track the phone calls that came from our room to security. The manager said there was no way he would be able to do that. But then went to get his business card and was gone quite a long time. When the manager came back out, he did offer to comp our room for the one night and then even offered us breakfast at the restaurant in the lobby. That was nice and is very appreciated but I thought very sad that we had to go thru that whole ordeal. We were not staying at a Motel 6 but we have had better service at one. We paid $200's per night for our room and we expect to get a $200 a night service. I don't believe that we got it at all. Also, the manager did state that the hotel noise policy is that the 1st time security is called for noise, that is the final warning. If it happens again, everyone is supposed to be kicked out. And they are in complete violation for smoking in the stairway. (We do have photos of the cigarette butts in the stair way also.) Obviously that didn't happen. Someone screwed up.

I'm about 7 mths pregnant and so didn't want to travel very far, so we settled on San Diego for our getaway. We had stayed at the Westin Princeville in Kauai last year and had the best time so I was really excited to stay at a Westin again. The smell of the toiletries definitely made me reminisce about Kauai. But of course, this was a totally different experience. For starters, we knew about the $32 valet parking, and so parked in an open lot on C street for $5/day. We had a very warm welcome from Kayti Koelln at the front desk. I asked her for a fridge for the room and I don't think she was able to get me one, but sent up really great cookies and a couple of bottles of apple juice instead along with a hand-written note. Nice! Already more hospitable than Kauai. She also asked for my SPG card and reminded me the waters were free and gave us a Preferred floor room. Nice! The room was average for a 4 star hotel, nothing spectacular. You could tell it was an older building that went through a renovation. And our view was of the skyscraper next door that was under construction. Not that I cared so much since there was no balcony to lounge on anyway. A balcony facing the ocean would've been nice, I guess. Some good things: 1. Being 7mths pregnant and forgetting all my pillows at home, I still had a great night sleep in the Heavenly Bed. The bed was comfy and had this long thin pillow that was great for supporting my belly and between my legs. 2. The fitness area was new and nice 3. The pool was nicely heated to almost body temperature, loved it for easy lap swimming 4. There were towels next to the pool 5. 5 block walk to Gaslamp Quarters 6. 1/2 walk to Seaport village 7. Guest services very responsive when you call them. Some bad things: 1. There was hair that was not mine in more than one place in the bathroom. I know it wasn't mine because I saw it there when I first walked in. There was some on a white towel and some on the tub. I used to camp a lot, so I still used the towels. But man, this is supposed to be a luxury hotel 2. There were flecks of black stuff on the hand towel. What are we cleaning, housekeepers? 3. There are these three things of fruity infused water in the front lobby but every time I tried to get some they were empty! It doesn't help to have the things there to tease us. Put some water in them! 4. Walking back from a movie late at night (around 11:30), there are some weird, crazy people who lurk right outside the hotel and talk to you or the air. Kinda creepy. 5. $32 valet parking 6. You have to pay for wifi and use of business center. 7.

We were unexpectedly charged $450 on the spot with no apologies from the staff on the error, and no explanation as to a breakdown of the charges.

I've never been to an upscale hotel for a birthday event where the staff didn't go out of their way to help us celebrate the special event, or at least SAY happy birthday.

This time I call the front desk and they send security up. He tries several times and he tries to use his pass key, and still it doesn't work. He again calls engineering. Apparently the doors electronic locks run on batteries and when they die, they have to get 'shocked\" into working and then the batteries have to be changed. So after 30 minutes this time, still no phone call apologizing, nothing....not a sorry for the PITA this was again. Disappointing customer service follow-up......hotel comfy....valet parking $$$ there is no free parking anywhere close by.

Also the valet that park the vehicles were very eager to help I even saw one run across the street to get a vehicle and I was impressed by his willingness to give prompt service. The parking charge is a little steep at thirty two bucks a day but what are you going to do and I doubt the other four star hotels in downtown are much cheaper so is not that big of a deal. Also the dual shower heads are a nice touch. Also I got the price on priceline for one hundred ten so I was very satisfied especially over the forth of july holiday.

Another CUDOS to Jeanine Benson, she was so helpful to talk to and gave us a tremendous restaurant recommendation (De Medici Italian Restaurant).

I would reccomend if this is your first time in SD as you are close enough to everything and in a pretty safe area (lots of other hotels in the vicinity). As a solo female traveller I felt perfectly safe. The hotel did have a restaurant and a bar which I didn't visit as it looked expensive. The hotel also featured a 24 hour fitness room and pool (not 24 hours) which I checked out and it all looked very well kept, and a massage studio. I paid $350USD for two nights for a room with a King Bed, my room was very well kept, extremely clean, including luxurious toiletries and a robe, I didn't hear any noise and was very comfortable. The only thing the room didn't include was very internet which was a shame however it is available in the lobby area (you have to resign in every 30 minutes). There is a great cafe which appears to be attached to the hotel but is actually an independant business - highly reccomend going there for breakfast - yummy and 1/3 of the price of the hotel. I was by myself so the room was quite large for me and I wanted to stay on in San Diego and not pay as much so I moved to a smaller hotel (2 blocks away - the Sofia - see my review on this). I would stay here again but only if i was able to split the cost with another room mate or if I could get a cheaper rate. Another nice area to stay in would be La Jolla - gorgeous upscale area about 1/2 hour away from downtown on transit but not sure how much rooms would be out there.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springdale, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cOne of my best hotel stays.\u201d", "Author": "lavenderlady52", "ReviewID": "UR109145312", "Content": "I have been traveling with my job for over 20 years and my current stay at the Westin was one of my best experiences.

He said he would find out for me and called me back to say that no one had found them and that I should call the following day so that he could speak to the people that made the room. My cousin stopped by the hotel the following day, after taking me to the airport, and Lex implied that I was mistaken because no one had turned in or seen the pajamas. It is very clear to me that whoever made the room took them and no one is taking action to get them back for me. I don't expect any of you to understand my grief. I lost the love of my life and I wanted to wear the pajamas that he gave me for the rest of my life. I need for you to conduct an investigation and recover my pajamas.

I'd heard good things about the Westin chain and decided I'd give it a try. I find it difficult to believe that there are that many hotels around that don't have enough parking to accommodate their guests. Every night I got a different story upon returning from a long day's work. The first night was normal, arrived back at the hotel, self parked and that was that (keep in mind when booking, you'll be paying $24 a day to self park). The next night I came back and the gate to the self parking was closed. I pulled up to the valet area and asked if it was full, and they said no, there are just certain days of the week that the gate closes automatically at night (the building is shared with other businesses). They had someone go over and open the gate, done deal. The next night, same story with the gate. I pulled up to valet and the guy looked at me like he had no idea what I was talking about. I asked if the lot was full and he said yeah. I said that I had a bunch of equipment I needed to unload, could I just pull down to the elevators and unload it / take it up to my room? He said sure, as long as you come back out. I got down there and saw that there were in fact a few spots. I unloaded my gear and tried to leave the structure. The gentleman that takes in money for parking asked where my ticket was, and I explained that the guys had let me in the valet ramp to unload and I didn't have a ticket. He didn't seem to get it, so I explained again. Eventually he said it'd be his butt that would get in trouble, and I said talk to your valet guys then. He let me out. The next night, when I had an assistant with me in her car, we were told to park in the public structure across the street from the hotel, as the hotel was once again full. Now I have to park in an unsecured, open-air structure that isn't even connected to the hotel. A block or two from the city jail. Nice. The next evening, I was told I should park on the street a block or two down from the hotel, seems every other day one side of the street gets cleaned, and I'd be safe if I left before 8am. That was the case, and while inconvenient, it worked out. All in all, not the best experience in terms of parking. I guess the idea is that I should just spend more money and use the valet services. The food at the hotel was pretty good. Issue being, their restaurant closes an hour earlier than it says it's supposed to in the guide book that was in my room. I was busy working till usually 9 or 10 every night at a hotel on the water covering some events. I'd return to my room bushed and ready to relax / have a good meal. Unfortunately for me, dinner was already done being served. Their late night menu sufficed, but still, how about thinking of the people that work a bit later than everyone else. One night I got back earlier, and decided to eat at the restaurant. Got down there, and was told that they had closed at 9 (book in my room said 10). They advised that my room service menu offered pretty much the same items that they serve. Still, sometimes it's nice to not eat from a tray in front of your tv. I was kind of amazed that I had to pay for internet in this day and age. Would be nice if they offered wired for free, wireless for a charge. They definitely don't seem to be catering to business travelers. Lastly, when my check out day arrived, they slipped my invoice under the door. I was given two separate sheets, with similar totals and a difference in charges. When I went down to the front desk to discuss the charges with them (discrepancy in laundry fees, etc) I was greeted by only a trainee. Another couple that was waiting at the counter was amazed as well by this, here it was check out time, and the only front desk staff was a new guy (no issue with him or being new, but that's a hell of a way to get someone to learn their job). He couldn't properly explain what the fee I questioned was, and said it was probably internet related. I said no, this feel (marked internet!) was the internet fee. He took the copies and said a manager was available, and disappeared. He returned sans manager, and sans one of the receipts, and still had the same answer, that the totals were the same and not to worry. At this point I gave up, as I had to be working about 15 minutes from then. Oh well. On the plus side, the heavenly bed was really nice. The air conditioning worked well.

Arrived and had to park about 1/2 block away as the entrance area was filled with valet parked vehicles. Bell person suggested that I check in first and then he would look after the luggage. The person who checked me in really didn't seem that he wanted to be working there. My first impression was that I was a bother to him rather than a customer. Having just come from a fabulous week at the Westin in Palm Desert, the first impression here was a real let down. I confirmed that the room that I had booked had two queen beds. Nope he said - all we have are two doubles. I asked if they did not have two queens and he just said \"nope\". How many keys do you want was the next question. I asked for two. When we got to the room there was only one in the folder. So much for paying attention to my answer. I went back out to the vehicle and my wife and kids had unloaded the luggage on to the sidewalk. The bell person was just standing there looking around, so I grabbed a luggage cart and started to push it down the sidewalk. That got his attention and he finally came to help. With the luggage unloaded I headed to the airport to drop our rental vehicle off. Went into the terminal and called the Westin for a pickup in their van. Will be there in 15 minutes was the reply. I waited 25 minutes and finally called again. No one seemed to know about my request and said that once I had my luggage I should call and they would come. I told the operator on the phone that I had already been waiting for 25 minutes from my first call. Sorry she said, we will be there within 20 minutes. I waited 20 minutes (now 45 in total) and gave up and grabbed a cab. When I got back to the hotel, the van was still parked in front and had not even moved. Went up to the room and my wife thought that it was housekeeping. She had called and asked for a couple of blankets and extra towels. Shortly after we left for dinner with friends for a couple of hours. When we got back to the room there still were no towels or blankets. She phoned again and it took over half an hour for them to arrive. I won't comment much on the room, except to say that the angle of the outside wall made things fairly tight with four people and luggage in the room.

This is not an exception to ay rule, I have had multiple moments of genuinely shown disinterest in me as a customer and guest form multiple staff members, leading me to believe that there is a management problem here. Although some incident are smaler than others, I just noted them because they are exemplary. 1. on entering the BF room, 2 staff members were chatting away. One literally with his hands in his pockets like he had nothing else to do. 2. We entered the buffet area at 8.30am on a weekend. Missing was: bread (really), Plain yoghurt (empty and not available anymore), pancakes (empty), butter (really). I noticed this one at a time and asked for these one at a time. Staff hadn't even noticed it before I asked. Once I got to the bread (4th item missing) I exploded and threatened to file a complaint. Suddenly, everything changed, I got my yoghurt which miracolously was found, we were given a extremely good service, which we enjoyed and thanked for and which is how it should've been in the 1st place. The guy with his hands in his pocket, who had earlier said \"There were so many guest, you guys cleaned out all the food in this place\"(really! those awful guests!) was suddenly helping out too. Just to be clear, I don't mind if something is missign or goes wrong (if it is not too much!) but what I do mind is a total lack of commitment to make things work in the first place. 2. The concierge was keeping it deliberately short to help other guests (understandable, but wrong in my humbel opinion because he made me feel less important than the guest waiting behind me), instead of answering my questions, which were not beyond anything normal a tourist would ask 3. When asked for quarters for the parking meter, I got 4 from a new rol or quarters (really). I asked for more, but he said he needed them in case more customers asked. When I said, that maybe they should stock for more quarters in a centrum district with paid parking, the atmosphere chilled to an unprofessional level, especially in a 4 star hotel.

I truly can say this is the best overall experience I've had at a hotel in my travels. From the time I was picked up by their complimentary hotel shuttle to the time I checked out the service was great. I used the Concierage service many times and all of the people who I encountered gave me great service and info, but there was one employee who worked at the Concierage desk that provided me with \"outstanding\" service and also went beyond the normal call of duty. Her name is Sopia. I dealt with her more than anyone else, but that is not why I'm writing this review. It's because of the extra things she did to accomodate me for my dining needs. I asked her about places to eat on several occasions and each time not only did she suggest a nice place, she volunteered to make the reservations. My last night there I told her I wanted to go to Coronado Island for dinner. It's across the bay from San Diego and I was taking the ferry. She suggested a restaurant named \"Peohe's\" that sits on the water and has an fantastic view of the San Diego skyline. She suggested if I got there by 5:30 pm I should be able to get a window view table. She told me she would call and make the reservation. Well she did make the reservation but did much more than that. Unbeknowing to me she asked the restaurant not only to seat me at a window table with a marvelous view of San Diego she also asked them to give me VIP service. When I arrived they seated me at a table with a breathtaking view of San Diego placed a vase of fresh flowers on my table and gave me a personalized menu that had a welcome to the restaurant from Sophia of the Westin welcoming my party with my last name on it. This was truly a nice touch & something that has never happened to me before. But it didn't end there the waiter informed me that Sophia would like to buy me an dessert on her after my meal if I so inclined. I was really surprised to say the least. She went far beyond her normal duty to make my dining experience a truly memorable one. I also must admit the dinner at the restaurant Peohe's was excellent and was the best meal I had during my visit to San Diego. Not only did she have a wonderful spirit she was a great person, with great insight. My visit at this hotel goes to the top of my list and I would recommend anyone to stay there.

Our front desk person was not very kind either. He was indifferent to my frustrations and did not offer any suggestions other than to sit and wait. He also told us that the rooms would be ready in about an hour, but they were ready 10 minutes after he told us it would be an hour. I'm glad that we decided to wait in the lobby and not leave the hotel. The room was clean and comfortable, which made things better. However, there was no mini bar frig, as advertised, and the television channels were terrible. We had to BUY kid appropriate television programs for my children. We went to the restaurant for breakfast on both mornings of our stay and the service and food was terrible. The host, manager and servers were completely unaware that there were guests in the restaurant. We had to actually get up and make a request for a server on several occasions. The food on the buffet was cold, stale and unappetizing. My husband and I ended up ordering off the menu on the second morning. We also had dinner in the hotel and that experience was much better. Our server was very attentive and the food was okay. This is the second Westin I've been to and both experiences have not been good. I don't think I'll stay in another Westin property. It looks great in the advertisements, but once you actually get there it's a totally different situation.", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNothing special\u201d", "Author": "nedgulden", "ReviewID": "UR91877758", "Content": "Stayed here as a pre-cruise hotel before Christmas and must admit I was disappointed.

I wondered about The Westin as I first took the elevator to my room. A group of business ladies commented that they would not stay here again. Before I begin on the negative issues, I would like to report that the Valet personnel were excellent. Though I usually don't use this option, I found all Valet personnel to be friendly, courteous and professional. Most hotels I stay at will ask in advance how many pillows I would like and do I prefer foam or feather. This was not done at your hotel. I felt that the maid must have been ordered to carefully look at the lotion and shampoo bottles to see if a drop could be squeezed out. 4 days with two of us in the room and the lotion and shampoo was never replaced. Towels and wash clothes that had been placed on the side of the tub were left by the maid. Though she did replace them, I didn't understand why she left them. The room usually wasn't made up until mid-afternoon and to be honest, the first day when I returned to my room, I didn't think the maid had been there yet because the bed appeared to be unmade. I then realized she had been in the room, she just didn't do a very good job at making the bed. My wife had left for a run while the made was in the room and when she returned she found that the maid had turned off the A/C. Since it was a fairly warm day in San Diego, she felt this was inappropriate. On our second day, we found that our keys were inoperative when we returned to our room in the early evening. Upon going to the front desk, we were told that they had to reset all the keys. If this was the case, I would have expected someone to have been by the elevators, informing guests of this before they ventured 23 floors up. The front desk clerk didn't offer an apology for the inconvenience. The workout room was very much like a sauna. I was in the gym at 0530 every morning and by 0545 I could see that I wasn't the only one sweating profusely. As I mentioned, I typically send out positive comments and I really don't like reporting on negative experiences, however; I hope that you will consider my comments and make some of the small changes that I feel are necesary.

They were smiling and friendly and quite different than some of the snooty staff i've seen in some hotels.

The breakfast staff had lots of really nice people with whom I used to love chit chatting in the morning , especially Zulema who was a wonderful hostess and always friendly , Juan who used to like talking Sports(the Giants!), Kelly McNorton , Jessie , Omar , Marites and Ramon . It was a nice crew and they ensured that the breakfast there was a fun start to the day. Because I was there everyday , I know that a few times they had to work long shifts, and once even a back to back shift from late last night to morning the next day but they were still patient and attentive. I used to also hang out at the bar for a wine or drink in the evenings. Melissa was the main bartender there and was very courteous and made some nice cocktails too. Jeanine, who manages the restaurant and the bar, was like my San Diego guide and had great suggestions for restaurants and things to do in the city.

To start with location: the hotel is right in the city centre, close to the Gas Lamp Quarter, or the seaside. Thanks to the very well organized public transportation it was no problem to get anywhere, the train station being just approx. 5 minutes by walk from the hotel. It is quite easy to get to the Sea World, or to go for shopping \u2013 very practical, when your husband is at the conference and you have the whole day for yourself! Although being close to the sea, this is not the place where you could actually swim \u2013 there is no beach nearby, just the port. So if you really wish to go to the beach, take a ferry to the Coronado island (from the port being just 10 mins by walk from the hotel). You can have a nice 20 mins walk accross the island to get to the Coronado hotel \u2013 do you remember the movie \u201eSome like it hot\u201c with Marylin Monroe, Jack Lemon and Tony Curtis? Did you know that \u201ethe hotel in Florida\u201c was actually in San Diego? So, if you love the movie (as much as I do), take a trip to Coronado \u2013 you will love it! As regards swimming \u2013 I am not sure what the weather usually is there, however, despite we were there at the end of August, the wind was quite cold and we did not feel for swimming at all. Perhaps we just had bad luck... The hotel itself: the rooms were nice and spacy, very clean, with all the comfort. The only thing that we were missing was a minibar. Initially I thought that I might use the hotel swimming pool \u2013 however, the weather was not very nice (it was foggy every morning) and the pool was just above a very noisy street and I did not feel this would be the best way for me to relax... So I did not try it at all... Food and service: very nice food for a reasonable price, very professional service. One thing to mention \u2013 down at the reception there were 4 tanks with water (all complimentary) \u2013 one had slices of lemon in it, another had slices of oranges, another one with melon, another one with grapefruit. Great idea \u2013 again something I could recommend for other hotels to introduce! Overall experience: pleasant and convenient for the stay during the conference.

I always prefer paying a little extra for the Starwood experience knowing I'll get something nice and luxurious but this time that wasn't the case. It started at 4am. I was only in town one night but at 4am for some reason an alarm, or what sounded like an alarm, went off for about 30 seconds waking me from my sleep. I couldn't find the source and it wasn\u2019t fire alarm loud, but way more than a simple phone or alarm clock alarm. Every 45 minutes or so this I\u2019d hear this noise and it completely killed my sleep. The worst part is i couldn\u2019t figure out what it was or where it was coming from. I admit I didn't call the front desk at that point because the noise was so intermittent and I really didn't want to change rooms at 5am. Finally after really getting up for the day I called to report the problem. The next problem was in the bathroom. The shower had hair from a pervious guest in it and so did the towels. I am usually understanding about these things, but it felt like insult to injury and was simply gross. I did tell the front desk person about both incidents and was comped breakfast/lunch but the only thing open was the bar. I was fine with that but the service at the bar was horrendous. It was a Sunday afternoon and there were probably 3 other parties there yet our service was terrible. Again, usually I love my westin experience and count on receiving it. That is why I'm willing to pay such a premium to stay there. However, based on this experience I could have received the same treatment for much much less.

They arranged a cheap car rental for the day so we could go up the coast (although the trolley goes there as well) and to Coronado Island (also easy by public transport but it's a big island). It's an easy walk to the sights downtown and the trolley to Old Town. It was our first visit to San Diego and we would go definitely go back.

There was a large crack in the center of the sill of our window and the hot water tap poured water from under the handle every time you turned on the water. (It soaked some of our travel items completely before we noticed the leak. The room showed much wear and took away from the romantic feel I had hoped for with my wife. We were also very disappointed that your valet charge was $32.00 PER NIGHT which we thought was more than excessive. Your staff was, as always, polite but the hotel was certainly not what I have come to expect from a Westin.

The food at the hotel restaurant was good. The breakfast buffet had a good selection and was a good value (eggs were under cooked, but otherwise no issues). When I checked in the front desk could not find my reservation at first. Even though I spelled my name, the woman looking it up obviously didn't listen and was looking under a different spelling. Minor issue. The keys I was given did not work and I had to get replacements. Those worked without problems. Minor issue. The room was generally clean. However, there were a couple minor issues where the cleaning should be more complete. Around the shower there were a couple minor issues where there was \"water damage\" that looked less than inviting. Some of it may be a bit of pealing paint because of the water. Minor issue though one that makes me concerned when thinking about such things as molds. It seemed to be around areas (for example, the ceiling) that the cleaning staff probably doesn't get to. While a minor issue, this would be one that I would consider conditional to being able to recommend the hotel to a friend. No venting for the shower. Takes awhile for the steam from a shower to go away which might be part of the cause for the issue mentioned above with the ceiling. Minor issue. Maid service did a good job of cleaning up every day. I was surprised the hotel charged for wifi. Minor issue, but makes the hotel less attractive. Check out was quick. Problem with the billing. I had asked that the entire bill be charged to my credit card and nothing be charged to the other person's credit card. This was not done and I had to call the hotel after I got home to fix it. This was resolved quickly and without too much trouble. However, I was told that the person working the billing dept was not in at regular times and I had to leave a message to get a call back at some future time. That is not even close to being acceptable. A billing problem should not be something I wait on. I asked for the manager and got Steve Kelly (I believe I have the correct name). He was able to resolve the issue quickly (at this point all charges are on my credit card though it will apparently be 7 - 10 business days before charges are removed from the other person's credit card so I don't know if its completely resolved -- I am assuming it is). Besides being an annoyance to have to fix this, it put me in an uncomfortable position because I had promised someone I was taking care of the bill and that person had to let me know that wasn't the case. For that reason, even though I will answer yes to the would you recommend this hotel to a friend, I have to say that its a conditional yes. Lastly, something that the hotel probably could not control was the construction across the street that started at 7:00am sharp every morning. Minor issue since this is outside the control of the hotel.

We visited the pool once, which is fairly small but was heated to a comfortable temperature, and the hot tub was relaxing after a long day of touring the city. The hotel is within walking distance of many great places to eat and drink, as well as the trolley line, which meant that we didn't need a car for the four full (and busy) days we spent there. Everyone we encountered at the hotel was friendly. We had a late flight out, and the front desk gladly held our luggage after we checked out and scheduled an airport shuttle for us later in the day.

The hotel location is terrific, and easy to access. My only two complaints from start to finish are the reservation systems and the parking. It would have also been nice to have free internet, especially as a SPG. I initially had my reservation Monday through Friday, and called the hotel the week prior to the stay in order to modify the reservation to depart on Thursday. I had reserved two rooms under my name, and I also added my SPG number to the reservation. When we got to the hotel, they only showed ONE room under my reservation. Unfortunately I had not brought my confirmation email to show the information indicating there were two rooms reserved. The reservation also showed that I was staying through Friday. I informed them that I had contacted the reservation number the week prior in order to change the departure date. All in all, it was not a big issue, as the manager made the appropriate changes, and added the second room. I did call downstairs once I was in the room, in order to request being moved farther from the elevator. They informed me that since I had requested double beds, they were not able to move me. I had not, in fact, requested double beds, but they apparently had a note in the system that someone had talked to me and noted a request for double beds. I informed them that they had not talked with me about the double beds, and I was told that the note must have been put on the wrong reservation. I ended up staying in the initial room for the duration of my stay. The hotel room was very nice, clean and spacious. I had a very nice view of the harbor and the city. The housekeeping was fantastic during my entire stay. Any questions we had were quickly and nice answered by the staff throughout the hotel. The gaslamp district and plenty of restaurants were within walking distance. Parking was steep at $32 per day. It's amazing to me how so many of the hotels charge such high fees for parking your vehicle. There was a parking lot up the street, where parking was $15 for 24 hours with in and out privileges. When we were ready to check out, the front desk informed us that they had us staying through until Friday. I informed them that that had been changed already.....twice. Westin SERIOUSLY needs to re-examne its reservation system! It was ridiculously frustrating. Overall, I would consider staying here again, and park up the street.

The only good news is I was able to get a room at the Omni at the last minute for about the same price and it was a much nicer hotel and next door to the convention center. So beware booking reservation with Starwood hotels -- they think of only themselves and not the traveler. E.

This hotel was on the organiser's recommended list and was one of the nearest priced to a government allowance. We noted it was NOT in the gaslamp quarter, but a colleague with previous knowledge of the area knew the proximity and it was only a short walk to the gaslamp district. This frequently involved passing vagrants but none of them ever verbally asked for money or harrassed us, I guess because verbally requesting money is either illegal or tantamount to admitting vagrancy which may be illegal in the US. Written signs were the most prominent form of request. This is not to detract from the hotel but explain the location and the experience of going to and fro the gaslamp quarter. On arrival at the hotel check in was swift and efficient. As a diabetic I enquired whether there was a refrigerator in my room to preserve my insulin supplies. Unfortuantely this was not standard in my room but the guy at reception promised to see if any were available. Within 30 minutes a porter brought one up and plugged it in. Job done. Thank you. The rooms are oddly shaped due to the buildings octagonal construction, so consequently you cannot complain that they are typically box shaped, well not quite anyway. The room was clean and well presented with coffee machine (Starbucks normal and decaff) plus a selection of teas. Note for Brits: Bring your own tea.. there is probably only one tea of \"traditional\" blend. Although well stocked the pots of milk are \"half and half\" which is okay for coffee... not so good for traditional tea, still I got by by using 1 pot only. Supplies are replenished daily. There is a large flat screen TV as promised with many claimed \"HD\" channels, although I think that is mainly hype as most of the broadcast material is definitely SD. I didn't try the movie service but would imagine they shoudl be proper HD versions. I tried to connect my laptop to the TV and stream videos instead however I had only brought a VGA cable and even if the TV had a VGA port, there was no acccess with a screwed on back plate and cover. However, on one side the TV did have a mini-DIN pin input + Red + White + Yellow... plus a few others so if you have cabling for those S-VHS style inputs I suspect you could be more successful than me. No free WiFi access, but wired and WiFi available in the room at a charge. I used it to Skype video conference back home to my wife. It worked brilliantly the first day (Sunday) but only partially for the others. Whether this was my home PC/home bandwidth or that the hotel WiFi is a shared service and hence there may be more competition on the week days, reducing my percentage of shared access to the internet I could not prove. The bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows and clean cotton linen. The air conditioning was effective and very quiet... I like to sleep cool so this was very beneficial. I did hear the rumbling of trams as mentioned by other patrons (presumably up to about midnight) however whether it was the effect of a modicum of alcohol consumption or pure jet-lag tiredness they didn't disrupt my sleep. The bathroom was clean and tidy and well managed with fresh dry towels when required. The double headed shower was very effective although I needed to ignore the wall plate which suggested turning clockwise to get hotter, when in fact my shower was anti-clockwise... perhaps the inlet pipes were switched on original installation? I used the free gym everyday usually 0630-0730. It is small gym for a hotel of this size but very well laid out in two sections. 1 full of aerobic machinery (Mainly LifeCycle/LifeStyle brand).... 2 x cross trainers, 2 x bikes (1 upright/1 sitdown) and about 4 running machines, sadly no rower. Some had the more modern touch screen LCDs (with integrated TVs or virtualised hill climbs) others are the more traditional red LED readouts. Of the 4 machines I used they were all in good operating order, although toe straps for the bikes would have been nice, but guess that's another nanny state health and safety risk! FYI, when I was there, maximum occupancy was probably 4-5 people. The 2nd section is more of an aerobics studio with free weights in the corner and Aerobic balls, the rest of the area is open and ideal for stretching. with floor to ceiling, wall to wall mirrors. There are a limitless supply of towels in both rooms and a water cooler in the nearby corridor. Both rooms have a view onto the pool and jacuzzi. I didn't use either. The pool is really very small and no good for serious swimmers (which I am not anyway) and more than 3 people trying to do lengths would be it, but it's nice and well kept as I spotted the staff checking the chlorine levels 3 times in the week I was there. Sadly when I may have wished to use it, later afternoon/early evening, the sun had been eclipsed behind neighbouring tower blocks... so perhaps best to use it up to and including lunch for a \"dip\" only. We didn't use the restaurant(s) at all but preferred to take breakfast via the onsite Starbucks franchise where you could get coffee (obviously) but also juice, cereals, pastries, muffins, granola bars etc, certainly enough for a modest every-day breakfast We used the hotel shuttle (FREE) bus to take us back to the airport (it's only about 10 minutes) but make sure you get dropped at the right terminal. Although we were flying back to the UK we were taking a domestic flight to LAX first and not a direct International one. The two terminals are actually quite a distance apart and involve getting on a shuttle bus... also if you've self-serviced and checked in mistakenly at the Intl. terminal but are then informed you have to board at another.. having suitcases tagged but in your posession between two terminals is quite disturbing to the check in staff at teh domestic desks. LOL In summary I'd say this is a good value for money hotel in a pretty reasonable location and if you can manage to save a few bucks and maximise use of the facilities it's probably a relative bargain.

If they hadn't made us wait until 6pm to check in, I wouldn't have had a problem with that, but since they were all taken and we had to check in at 6pm, I was very upset, but sitll didn't complain.

Your best bet is to park your car in the lot behind the hotel (the street parallel to braodway) for $17 a day and take a taxi or walk where you need to go (It's $5 a day on the weekends and holidays).

It definitely is clean and the service was what I expected. But here is a list of my issues. 1. Booked a room with two double beds and requested a rollaway which was printed on my confirmation. Upgraded for $25 to bayview. At check in was told that rollaways were not permitted due to fire codes. Impossible for me and two teen boys to fit in the room we were given. Even though it was an upgrade, the room was so small, you could not walk around the beds, there was no door to the bathroom that you could close, only a pocket door that did not close. Windows were covered up in places with yellow tape, as if they were broken. Upon seeing the size of the room and the unavailability of the rollaway, I had to book another room. Funny thing is - in booking the new room - I got the cheapest room available at the time and it was much larger and nicer than the original room I booked (so my issue with the hotel, is what is the point of an upgraded room, what exactly did my upgrade pay for)...! By the way the cheaper room also had a bayview. Another point of contention, my friends stayed in a lower rate room and not only had more space, a bayview and a real bathroom door, but also received bathrobes, which I did not get). My suggestion is do not get the upgrade!! Another point of contention is the location. I think it is convenient in the sense that you can walk to just about anywhere you need to go, but I would not feel comfortable at night in that area, definitely as a woman with kids felt like I had to be hyper aware. I am used to the homeless, living and working in Boston, but the hotel seems to be in a very active homeless area.

One strange thing was that housekeeping kept leaving clean towels but never took the dirty ones. By the end of the stay we had quite a collection of towels!! The hotel was centrally located to the train depot, the wharf and within walking distance to Little Italy. Wehad no problems getting around without a car which was why we chose a central location.

I was usually with a group when walking back to the hotel from dinner so didn't feel afraid. However, on one occasion when I had to walk back to the hotel alone someone tried to follow me.

The location was great and we could easily walk to all the venues. The train depot is nearby and the highway entrance/exit is less than a mile away so it makes getting around the San Diego area very simple. The hotel itself was very clean, felt freshly decorated and comfortable. The room was spacious and everything worked properly. The bed is enormous and we slept very well. There were two 'comfy chairs\" of different styles. We got some noise from the train depot and the ships coming into the harbor, but nothing to inhibit rest. The staff anticipated us running out of shampoo, etc, and left more when they saw we were running low. On my birthday, I came back to the room to find they had set my birthday card from my husband( --which I had just opened that morning )on the bed and surrounded it with chocolates! We attended parties for the festival at different venues and met up with groups staying at the nearby W hotel, and both my husband and I agreed we preferred the Westin for comfort and serenity . Our room overlooked the bay and we could watch the sailboats and cruise ships come in. It is well worth a little extra to us to get that sort of water view. All the employees from the front desk to the valets, housekeeping and restaurant staff, were friendly and helpful. Every single one. They gave us directions and answered questions. No attitude or rush. What a refreshing change after a recent stay at a factory-feeling hotel in Vegas! The breakfast buffet at the restaurant is a little expensive ($18--for me who usually stumbles around at home in the morning with tea and toast) but has a great selection of fruits, yogurts, breads and hot dishes. You can also order a la carte off the menu and there is a coffee shop in the lobby so you can just grab a quick bite. My only caveat would be that despite the convenience of the location, some people might not enjoy the area as there are many homeless who may approach--and did ---even just inside the hotel doors one evening. There is a Greyhound bus station a couple of blocks away and the people you meet on your walks can seem a bit dodgey. I'm from LA and used to that, but I know my family from Wisconsin would be uncomfortable. Area parking is also expensive but worth it to keep one's car safely indoors under guard. Again, coming from LA I find it is a false economy not to pay for parking in a downtown area.

Staying here again would certainly not be the worst thing, there are definately some niceties, but the little things started to add up enough that next time we go to San Diego we will very likely try another hotel as this Westin did not \"sell us.\" The good: 1) We asked for a high floor and received a room on the 20th floor. 2) Great view of the water and sunset. 3) Great shower. 4) Convenient location (close to a brewery; Gaslamp Quarter; Petco Park; WAMU ATM; bagel shop; Seaport Village etc.). 5) Staff was very friendly, helpful and accessible (but not always successful). The not-so-good: 1) The air conditioning either didn't work the first night or has such a high setting of temperature to be useless. The next day we asked for both the air conditioning to be looked at and for a good old fashioned fan. We were advised both would be handled within a short time. When we came back to the room several hours later, there was a note that the air conditioning was fixed, but there was no difference from what we could tell. Also, there was no fan. I called downstairs to the front desk and asked again for the fan; was told again a fan would be delivered to our room; but no fan was ever delivered to us as promised. The bed was very comfy, but because the room was stuffy we got little sleep. 2) We left the room around 10 a.m. the 2nd day we stayed, and when we arrived back around, ballpark, 5 or 6, no housekeeping had been done (we're pretty low-maintenance, but were expecting at least clean towels and the bed made so called down for towels and TP and let the rest be as was). 3) Couple small things: Would be nice if there was a phone book and a TV listing guide in the room as there was neither and... 4) There's no place in the bathroom to hang a wet towel. 5) The day we left, I went downstairs to print out our boarding passes. First, I was unable to access the door with my room card as it indicated to do, so I went to the front desk to get assistance. She also had trouble till she realized they decided not to lock the door any longer so you really didn't need a key (although it did not indicate this on the door but rather the opposite). When I tried to print the pass, there was no paper in any of the 8 drawers of printers or copy machine. Back I went to the front desk where they had to call an engineer for paper as that dept. was the only one who was allowed to load paper. Went back to the front desk about 15 minutes later. They called Engineering again. Engineering was there in about 5 minutes after the 2nd call, but he only loaded paper into 2 printer drawers so I did let them know the copier & other printers were out as well (to hopefully avoid frustration for both engineering and customers later that day). Ultimately, the Jet Blue site would not print out the pass after all my repearted attempts (it was asking for some kind of code for that particular computer that was not supplied or I didn't figure out) so the whole process proved a frustration. 6) I filled out a review card at the hotel before I left AND also an online form sent to me a couple weeks later. I have, as of yet, NEVER received any comment from the hotel regarding some of the frustrations we experienced (it is now 7/27/08 - almost 2 months later - I waited to see if they would send me some consolation - even just a few words - but nothing).", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood example of a Westin\u201d", "Author": "AstroJunq", "ReviewID": "UR18243961", "Content": "This hotel has a great downtown location, a beautiful lobby, very nice rooms and pleasant staff.

I would stay here again, even for vacation, just for the beds, shower, and TV!", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brentwood, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cWonderful rooms but noisy\u201d", "Author": "kellilou3", "ReviewID": "UR14754301", "Content": "I stayed at the Westin San Diego for a conference and really loved the hotel. Its location was convenient to a few restaurants (you must try Currant, a couple of blocks down Broadway), the harbor and a mall. I really enjoyed being able to walk to these sites. The bed was also SO comfortable, and the room was spacious. However, the traffic noise along Broadway was so loud that I had to request earplugs from the front desk the next morning. I would suggest requesting an interior room, if you're at all a light sleeper. Additionally, the restaurant inside the hotel is very overpriced. The breakfast buffet was $19, and it didn't include anything special that would justify that kind of expense. If I weren't staying here for business (and having it paid for), I would definitely shop around and find a better value.", "Date": "April 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "So.CA", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "mahalofromCA", "ReviewID": "UR14672096", "Content": "I stayed here with my hubby, and 3 kids (7, 5, 1) and had a great time.

They have a shuttle bus from the airport. Upon check in, the room was not made up. Which was initially ok, because they sent us from the 10th floor to the 22nd. But the new room was smaller. Sometimes my 7 year old daughter walked into the bathroom after opening the room door, because of the design of the room. View was nice from 2221, with some bay and Coronado. Beware, they are starting to dig foundations in front, so I am sure in a year there will be no view, what with a new building. The air conditioning is noisy, and the sink makes a Glug Glug sound for a few minutes after running water (air in the pipes). We were smart and didn't rent a car until the day we wanted to visit the coast up to Oceanside and back inland to San Diego. $28.00 per day parking at the hotel! You can take the #7 bus to the Zoo from 1st and Broadway. $2.25 each way. Free for 5 and under. We arrived around 2pm. walked over to the Gaslamp district, about 8 blocks, then down to Seaport Village, back through Horton plaza. Had dinner at Blue Point on 5th....very $$. $135.00 for 2 adults and 1 child. The second day we took the bus to the zoo and had dinner at Henry's pub on 5th. $50. Including a beer(Newcastle). Unlike Blue Point, Henry's has a kids menu. We then rented a car from Avis on Kettener and Cedar around 8am for $50 incl taxes and booster seat. We drove up the coast and then back for a 6pm departure from the airport. I would stay at the hotel again, but only if I use my miles like I did this time. Otherwise $250 per night inclusive is a little high for 2 adults and a child.", "Date": "March 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cIf it's Tuesday, this must be a Westin\u201d", "Author": "timelvis", "ReviewID": "UR14149962", "Content": "One thing you have to say about a Westin is that they are consistently the same. No matter what city...or even country... you are in, you step into a Westin room and you have to look out the window to remind yourself where you are. This is not necessarily a bad thing. When you are traveling on business (which this visit to the Westin San Diego was), it is nice to have some place familiar to hang your hat. You have your Heavenly Bed with upteen pillows and your Heavenly Bath with a double shower head (too bad the water pressure wasn't double, too). What was different about this Westin was the 32-inch flat screen LCD television with several HD channels that left me craving digital when I returned home. What wasn't different was the sporatic wireless Internet connection. And what wasn't different was the overpriced onsite restaurant with the same menu as room service. Trust me, this gets tedious if you are staying in a hotel more than two nights and you can't get out to find a decent restaurant. There is a Ralph's grocery store a few blocks away if you want to cut the cost and buy your own snacks. Be forewarned there are no refridgerators in the room (although you can improvise with the in room snack center). The Westin San Diego is in a great downtown location. They provide a free airport shuttle (ten minutes away) and you are a few blocks from the waterfront, Gas Town and Little Italy. And it is in San Diego after all, one of the most beautiful American cities. There is a decent (but small) workout room and equally small and odd shaped outdoor pool that is adjacent to the conference rooms (so don't expect privacy if you are sunbathing). All in all the Westin San Diego is a decent place to stay if you are on business and someone else is footing the bill. If you are on vacation, I'd opt for something different.", "Date": "March 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "lovetofly4", "ReviewID": "UR14133607", "Content": "Just returned from a refreshing weekend in San Diego. I had a business seminar and my husband accompanied me so we could enjoy the evenings together. we arrived at the hotel on saturday afternoon at 1pm and were able to check into our room early. this was after absolutely no wait at the front desk and without calling ahead to ask for early check-in. parking at Emerald Square (plaza hotel is part of) is $24/night for self parking. right across the street, on columbia, there is $15/night parking - however, both lots do not allow re-entry. this worked out just fine because the hotel is walking distance to the water, as well as, all the restaurants and nightlife. we thought this was great because it allowed us to enjoy the crisp San Diego air and work off all our great meals. we were given a nice king bay view room even though i had just booked the $179/night rate for a standard king room with a city view. the HUGE king bed lived up to prior reviews of comfort and we guiltily watched 2 movies on the flat screen over our weekend for $11/movie - obviously overpriced but a good selection of current films. i agree with previous comments that the room is somewhat small in comparison to other standard hotel rooms. we didn't find it bothersome, however. we enjoyed drinks and an appetizer downstairs one evening and our bill came to $35 - probably typical for a lobby bar. my husband enjoyed the outdoor pool and free weights in the gym during the day and got some work done in the hotel office room in the lobby - equipped with glass desks and computers (though he used his own wireless card to avoid the internet charges). the taxes applied to hotel rooms in San Diego are high, and brought our nightly rate up to $201/night - this is a downside of staying in San Diego. overall, a great stay!", "Date": "March 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Murrysville, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cNot What You Would Expect from Westin\u201d", "Author": "tzinnca", "ReviewID": "UR13215780", "Content": "This hotel is below expectations for a Westin.
