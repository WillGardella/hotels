We are Hilton Honors Gold card members and had requested a room on a high level with a view of the water using our points. That's exactly what we got... suite on the 12th floor looking out on the bay with a view of the Midway ship and the park with the statue of the sailor and girl kissing! Sometimes at other locations when we've used our points from the Hilton Honors program we have received what might have been referred to as \"left over\" rooms- at any rate not the ideal kind of room we would have expected. At this hotel, not only were we recognized as Hilton Honors members with a welcome note in our suite and snacks and water, but assigned a great suite. The furnishings were obviously new and the suite was immaculately clean. The bathroom was a little small, however. Both flat screen tv's were in working order with remote controls in both rooms. Our suite was not ready when we arrived but the Front Desk staff gave us a coupon for a free drink at the Starbucks on sight and asked for our cell phone # so that she could call us. She checked with Housekeeping to see when the suite would be ready and was told 10-15 minutes. It was ready before we could even get to Starbucks! Yes, the valet park is expensive at $29.00, but one should know that when making the reservation as it is clearly indicated on the Hilton website AND it is not anymore than the majority of hotels in downtown tourist destinations. (We paid $40 a night in Chicago!) The only issue we had with the valet parking is that the did not seem to be sufficient valets to handle the outgoing cars and they generally would not take requests for valet service when calling down from the room to have the car ready. The Manager's Reception in the evening was very good with free drinks, soda's, celery, carrots, dips and crackers.... more than some other hotels... and of course, it was free. (They don't advertise this to be a meal!) We did not take advantage of the complimentary breakfast, but I imagine it was crowded as the hotel was very busy. The location is very close to Seaport Village... only a 10 minute walk, and also close to other areas of downtown San Diego is one doesn't mind a longer walk. Ralph's Grocery store is nearby but one might prefer to drive it - there is a free parking garage attached to Ralph's.

This location in Downtown San Diego was extremely disappointing. The furnishings, first of all, are outdated and the carpets need a good shampooing. For the rate you pay here, you would think they would have updated furnishings. But I can live with that. The service, on the other hand, was unacceptable. First, no remote control for the TV in the room. We have to call down to get it - they take FOREVER. We ask them also \"Could you bring up a wine opener\" They inform us they are out of wine openers and we have to take our wine all the way down to the bar and ask them to open it. Really? You couldn't come up and open it for us since you are out of the courtesy wine openers? We get dressed, trek down to the bar... they say they don't open wine bottles for the hotel customers -- they are a separate entity. OK... now what? The next day, housekeeping does not clean our rooms. We arrived back to the hotel about 8pm. There are dirty dishes FROM BREAKFAST in the hallways along with dirty towels. They have been sitting there all day, no one has cleaned the halls or our room. (See attached pictures). I go down to complain to the manager. He makes excuses and recites them as if it's common to get complaints. Finally, he says \"What do you want me to do?\" I have never stayed in a hotel where the manager made so many excuses and didn't jump to make a bad situation better. Clearly the service in the hotel is a reflection of their management. They ended up crediting me one night (still waiting for it, but they said they would give credit) but I will never stay at this hotel again. Even the hot tub was out of commission for part of our stay. On a plus side, the complimentary breakfast was cooked to order and good.

The only options they have though are 2 double beds in a room and a pull out OR a king bed in a room and 1 pull out. They do not supply cots or mattresses. What a headache for a family such as ours since our boys will NOT sleep in the same bed and my husband is 6'2 and having us sleep on a pullout or a double bed would not work at all. We ended up taking the cushions off of the pull out bed and creating our own little bed for our 11 year old. We were a bit early for check in at 3pm. The lady at the desk told us she couldn't let us in early and to come back at 4. At that time we discussed with her the needs we had as a family. She was quite snotty and rude by indicating we could get a 2 bedroom suite that would accommodate us however the rooms start at $1200 if we were willing to pay that. No kidding this is what she said! So first of all, why is there a spread of $1000 for these rooms. Otherwise why is she suggesting that maybe we couldn't afford the other suite? My husband told her that perhaps we had chosen the wrong hotel and we may look elsewhere to which she replied that there is a cancellation policy with 72 hours notice. GREAT! We came back at 4pm as she told us to only to find a line up beyond belief. The systems were down and the place was chaos. I have to say that the manager was on the floor helping out which was great to see. He spoke with my husband and gave us the go ahead to check out early or if we wanted to find another hotel that he wouldn't hold us to the room booked with them. Reasonable, at least someone was attempting to help with a positive attitude and willing to compromise a solution for our family. Underground valet parking only $32/night. It took up to 60 min to get our vehicle at times and no phone in to the valet was permitted as they were so busy. Understandable, but just sucks when you and your family want to go somewhere and then you're stuck waiting around the lobby for an hour. Wifi fee of $12.95/night PER DEVICE! CRAZY! The manager did agree with my husband that if we added more devices they would comp back the fees. We never added any other devices as the wifi wasn't working anyway and ended up being a waste of money. The breakfast lines were nuts, sometimes taking up to 40 minutes to get to the buffet. The omelet line wasn't even an option for us because it was even longer. When the time came for the breakfast to be over, the stuff was cleaned away and even if you had waited 25 min to get through the line, you were outta luck. The pool is tiny and indoor and cold. Jacuzzi wasn't much better. Although the manager was fantastic in helping us finding solutions to the issues we faced, I still would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. Every time we walked in the place I felt upset and disheartened. I have always been a fan of the Hampton chains, although now, I have a different idea of what it is like to stay at Embassy. We ended up checking out a day early and heading to Arizona as planned for a day later. We were thrilled when we arrived in Scottsdale at The Hyatt House where for the same price per night we received a 2 bedroom suite with king beds and bathrooms in each and a kitchenette and living room with a pull out couch. AWESOME! Breakfast there was amazing with REAL eggs, endless choice of fruits and friendly helpful staff. Beautiful pool and jacuzzi. Boy were we glad we made the choice to leave San Diego Early!

It was the worst experiences I have had at a hotel at any price level. I travel frequently all over the world for business. This time I was hosting a guest from out of the country and we chose to stay downtown San Diego for the experience for him, but I was very embarrassed by this hotel. This hotel is charging a premium rate and trying to put a premium window dressing on the experience but is completely incapable of executing the fundamentals. Here are the specifics: -- Valet parking is the only option for parking and it is $30. Everything in this area of town is expensive, but still for $30 you would expect good service. It is horrible. It took over 15 minutes to get the car. Furthermore all the cars arriving were stacked up and no one could get in because they were so slow to park them. -- Front desk staff is very rude and slow. We inquired about early check-in and without even checking the reception staff just said nothing was available. Ok fine, but this also meant we could not utilize the business center because although it is next to the front desk it requires a key to enter and we were not allowed to use it until we could be assigned a room. -- WiFi fee is $13/day and there is no free option in the lobby. -- The elevators are slow and it is a long wait for this busy hotel. I finally was checked in and I went to my room on 9th floor only to find my keys would not work. I made my way back to the lobby, waited in line again, they re-scanned my keys with NO apology, I went back up to my room, again the keys did not work. I went back down waited in line again -- 40 minutes wasted. This time they discover OOPS! they had given me the wrong room. They get this straightened out, hand me a key and I head to my room. NO apology. -- The room was clean. However, they are changing from old tube tvs to flat screens and the armoire in my room was half dismantled with video game controllers hanging out like a college dorm. -- Breakfast. Somehow they managed to burn our custom cooked omelettes. The food at the buffet was terrible...soggy potatoes, rubbery French toast and the toaster barely worked. -- While we were eating breakfast a maintenance worker rolled a cart through the middle of where everyone was eating. On top of the cart was a kitchen floormat. We saw him go through the kitchen and came right back with what appeared to be the same cart now with clean dishes were the mat was and go put them out at the buffet. -- The hotel was very busy and I saw a lot of employees standing around doing a whole lot of nothing while guests were waiting for help.

We booked a Getaway Rate which included free parking, 15% off room service charges and on-demand movie each night. Large bathroom with bathtub (plus when traveling with toddler kiddo).

Starbucks is connected to the hotel.The days we did eat breakfast in the hotel, it was good, hot and great selection. Managers happy hour was good and never overly crowded; na drinks, beer - Michelob Amber Bock and Rolling Rock plus chips, trail mix and veggies for snacks. Negatives - Hotel is in the middle of a re-model or room upgrades. Free full breakfast was a nightmare wait as the hotel was maxed at capacity with number of people per room and rooms taken, due to 2 conferences and the TX/Cal college bowl game that week. Line was wrapped throughout the atrium each morning for breakfast unless you went 7am. This also lead to ridiculous waits for the elevators - there are 4 but it didnt help as one was unavailable due to installation of new flat screens being transported for 2 days we were there. We ended up at the Hyatt one morning and at Busters in Seaport Village (good place) a 2nd morning for breakfast due to craziness. Valet parking was crazy busy since everyone has to valet it can make for long waits between post-breakfast at 930am - Noon checkout time. Negatives -Room service - limited menu due to remodel in progress. Basically, you get your room service food from the restaurant/bar downstairs. Many times the restaurant is so packed at night, they would not answer the phone so I went down and place my orders in person to-go. Overheard the bartender and wait staff talking that they do not answer the phone the last 30 minutes before room service closes.

Upon valet parking the car (it's $29 and there are no other options at the hotel), my significant other and I informed the attendant that it was imperative no one roll down the driver side window, as it was broken. We were assured it would not happen. We arrived at 4 pm (check-in time) and were informed the room was not ready. We were given a free appetizer coupon for the PFC restaurant in the hotel so we could go and wait. I left my cell number with the front desk to call when the room was ready. After over an hour of waiting with no phone call, I sent my S.O. to the front desk to check. After several minutes, he returned visibly angry because the front desk clerk (who was not the one that initially talked to us) had been extremely rude to him because the reservation was not in his name. I finally went to the front desk myself and was checked in by another very sweet girl. It seems strange to me that they would ask for my phone number, and then never call! As per my paid upgrade, we received an 11th floor room with balcony and bay view. It was a wonderful view. But the room was obviously old and in need of updating. Furniture was scratched, I could see pins sticking out of the curtains near the ceiling, the TV remote buttons stuck, and the shower lost water pressure in the middle of a shower. When we left to go out for dinner (it was a surprise birthday dinner for my S.O. so I had privately arranged a taxi with the front desk earlier), the parking attendant recognized and approached us to say that the window on our car had been rolled down and was now stuck half-way down. At this point, we were becoming slightly irate at the continued sub-par treatment we were receiving. After seeing how irritated we were getting, he finally offered to comp us the parking fee. Embassy Suites had pre-arranged a fee for our taxi at $35 to get to Coronado. On our return trip, we discovered the actual meter cost was less than $20. Thanks for the rip-off, Embassy Suites. We could not enjoy the managers reception because 30 people were lined up to get their free drinks, we could not enjoy the complimentary breakfast because the line was wrapped around the corner, and we could not enjoy the pool or jacuzzi because both of them were packed. When we checked out in the morning, the parking fee had not been waived and we had to have a final battle with the front desk about getting the charges removed!

On most occasions when traveling as a couple we make the Embassy Suites our base. Again on this trip we were not disappointed. Super convenient to the airport and an easy walk to Petco Field, the Convention Center, the harbor attractions, and gas lamp district restaurants. The trolley (and Amtrak) is close at hand. A short drive reaches Point Loma, Balboa Park, SeaWorld, Old Town, and pretty much any other district you would want to visit within the area. True, it's a typical Embassy Suites with families crowding into rooms and reunions and conferences keeping things hopping. But the manager's reception is wonderful, the breakfast is up to ES standards and there's even a Starbucks on the property. Besides, with the double rooms, you can always insolate yourself from the sounds of the atrium activity. One ding, perhaps is the crowded lobby. Some of the somewhat brusque demeanor that staff can exhibit at times probably comes simply from trying to keep people from tripping over each other -- or themselves. We, however, found everyone truly helpful, including the concierge for dinner reservations, and the valet parking attendants who almost always kept, literally, on the run. One special note. When we left for the airport at 4:45 AM, the valet attendant was nowhere in sight. A custodial staff quickly noted the problem and although speaking very little English made clear to us that he would find the attendant for us and within 90 seconds this janitor had the valet located and on the run to assist us. That kind of thorough going service mind set throughout an organization is what makes the difference between a hotel we want to come back to -- or one that we scratch off our lists. Another compliment. There was new furniture in our room since our last visit. Everything seemed well maintained and furnished. One hint. We think it's worth the extra cost to guarantee a bay view suite. The views are incredible and there is no end to the hours that can be spent just watching ships (including aircraft carriers) and boats (the smallest sailboats) plying the harbor approaches. We even think it's worth the premium to ensure a balcony. Be warned, these aren't lounging style balconies with furniture.

Cozy, warm and inviting and the location is definitely what gives it 5 stars over 4. It's your usual Embassy Suites - which we've grown to love and be comfortable with. The lobby was nicely done with a lovely koi pond (please remove the coins from the water, however, they're poisionous for the fish). :) The rooms are fairly large - 2 room suites (as with most of these hotels) and was nicely set up and quite clean. We did have issues with the bathroom - the faucet to the sink was loose and the shower leaked continuosly - but once we mentioned this to the front desk while checking out, the front desk clerk was clearly horrified and I'm sure it was correctly quickly. (though I wonder why the maid never said anything prior to us to the management or front desk). Anyway, the bed and pillows were very comfortable and the room overall was quite nice. Also, we requested a room with a view and got a nice view of the bay. Note: the hotel is located on a fairly busy street so we also had that view - but the bay made us for it. The smell of the free morning breakfasts was a nice wake up call to me (though my husband thought it was a bit much as it wafted into the room each morning). And the breakfasts were consistantly high quality, fresh and delicious. What a wonderful way to start each morning. Also, the atmosphere of eating in the atrium was lovely - and the staff cleaned up and kept everything spotless. The conceirge was very nice and helpful as well and helped us decide to go to Old Town - HIGHLY recommended!!! It was a great day and a wonderful experience. Another plus of the hotel was the little internet room which housed 3 computers. And, the absolute best pro of this hotel was its proximity to Seaport Village! Located about a block away, this village was amazing and my husband and I went every night. There were tons of cute shops and restaurants and it was truly a great place to walk around and great some fresh air and enjoy the sights of the bay and a fireworks show (on Friday night.) Cons of the hotel were minimal and we'd definitely stay here again. Cons include the $29 a night valet parking (but - it's a city and all hotels have this) -- at least these valets were incredibly quick and quite nice too. The other con was the mild smell in the hotel of old dampness. This likely came from the pool downstairs or the fact that the bay is a block away. Again, it is mild and would not turn us off from returning. Thanks again Embassy Suites for a great vacation! PS - on a side note - we also stayed at the Hyatt in Mission Bay (to get a sense of another part of the city as well as try a more upscale hotel.)

Our room was upgraded to a 2 room suite which was very spacious. The largest part of the room was the dining/wet bar area. It would have been better for our family to have that area be smaller and have a larger living area. With only one chair, we had to make up the sofa bed each day in order to have seating for all 4 of us. Even if we would have tried to bring in the dining chairs, they would not have fit in the small space where we watched TV. A sink and vanity area is located outside of the bathroom in addition to the one in the bathroom. That was especially nice when my son got sick and we were able to designate his area to try and keep the rest of us well. The hotel was clean and smelled wonderfully fresh as you entered the lobby. It smelled a lot like mildew near one of our sinks, but housekeeping opens the windows each day and that helps. Our room was vacuumed at least one of our 5 days there. I still cannot understand why hotel rooms with 4 occupants only get 2 or 3 washcloths, however! We asked for more and they were quickly provided for. The hotel is located next to Seaport Village which has several shops and restaurants. Most of the restaurants are counter type with outdoor eating space only. So, most of the tables weren't very clean and you have to contend with the pigeons. The setting is gorgeous however with several sidewalk vendors from henna tattoos to balloon twisting. A trolley stop is only a 1/2 block away, but we did not use it. Cindy, the concierge in the hotel lobby, gave us the name of a driver who provided round-trip transportation for us to the zoo one day and Sea World the next.

The manager's reception was nice as well. Lots of variety at the bar area. The pool and spa area was your typical hotel fare. There were plenty of towels and seating.

I did not expect anything spectacular and anything bad, just a good reasonable comfortable stay with free breakfast. All of my expectations were met. I was able to check in early (before noon) and was given a balcony room by a nice front desk clerk. Only bad thing about the balcony room is that your next door neigbor also have a balcony and can see directly into your bed so you may have to use the privacy curtain. But I will take a balcony room anyday over the standard room. The room overall was typical of Embassy Suites with comfortable bed, roomy seating area with fridge and microwave. Room was pretty clean except the doors to the balcony were little dirty with a lot of fingerprints. I went down to eat breakfast at 7AM (thanks to still on the Eastern time zone). On the menu: Omelettes, scrambled eggs, home fries, bacon, pancakes, yogurt, apple, banana, pastries, cereals, coffee, milk and juices. The qaulity is okay and more than satisfactory for a \"complimentary\" breakfast. The dining area staff were always pleasant except the omelette station cooks who are pokerfaced, probably due to the pressure to move the lines quickly. Talking about the lines, between 7 - 8:30AM appears to be the best time. After that, I noticed the lines got really long for both the omelette and the hot food stations. The manager's reception also brought a long line to the bar. I only grabbed popcorn which was good. I didn't see any hot food items like chicken wings. Location was great as a tourist. You are a few blocks away from the trolley lines and the Seaport Village which I enjoyed for food (except for the price of a Hagaan Daaz milk shake, $8!!). I debated staying more towards downtown (Westin) but I much prefer this location as unless you are right on Gaslamp Quarters area, the other downtown locations are pretty dead and don't really have things to do or character based on my observations. Gaslamp area is very busy with a lot of restaurants/bars, if that is your style. I didn't check out the pool so no comment on that. This area seemed safe with some upscale looking residential condos in the area. I would definately stay here again. Things to note: The commuter train noise some of the reviewers are complaining is overrated. Unless you are really sensitive to noise, it won't bother you. I hate to pay for parking. I rented a car the last day of my stay and found a street parking couple of blocks away for overnight. I just had to feed the meeter at 8am (I think it has a 3 hour limit).

This particular hotel excelled with customer service, the pool/hot tub area, Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries, and especially, the location. It's across the street from the waterfront, a block or so from the USS Midway and touring boats, a couple of blocks from the convention center and the Gaslamp district, and a very short drive to Petco/Padres stadium. There are many restaurants right at the front door. The hotel common areas are lovely. The only two negatives that I have is that some of the inroom furniture has seen better days. They may be in the process of replacing it, though, as there appears to be brand new pieces mixed in among the battle weary. The other is that housekeeping is just adequate. One day we were left only one wash cloth, another day there was no bar soap. They kept everything very clean, but the lack of attention here was annoying.

This was my 2nd stay there. We investigated many hotels in San Diego before booking the ES mainly because on my previous visit, I was unable to get up to the Gaslamp District. (I was traveling with my 70 year old Dad for a Marine Corps reunion) After checking many reviews in the District, I happily booked a balcony suite at ES. First, the location of this ES cannot be beat. You can walk everywhere and we only used our car to go to the zoo. Second, the Staff could not be better. We prefer Embassy Suites when we travel because of the room space and hotel amenities. ES - San Diego does not fail in these categories! The breakfast was awesome and the breakfast team friendly. Parking is expensive but that seems to be standard for San Diego. We didn't consider onstreet parking. And we definitely recommend going to Ralph's grocery store a couple of blocks away and if you want a friendly cocktail and \"locals\" bar fun, go to Joe's Crab Shack behind the Convention Center. Both are within walking distance and you won't be disappointed. Concerning the Gaslamp District, we went on a Friday night and found most of the bars to be friendly but unless you really want to pay a cover charge - WALK AWAY and find another bar. We were led to believe this was the norm by the doorman at the place with the mechanical bull and found out that wasn't true. I refuse to pay cover charge unless there's entertainment. Some of the best drinks we found were at the TGI Friday's! Fun staff and great food/drinks. One downside to be aware of and this IS NOT the fault of the Embassy Suites. When walking downtown please be aware there seems to be a large number of homeless in the area. While we were never hassled, the number was surprising. It's a shame but that's the reality of our current economy. Not enough help for everyone. Again - this is no reflection of the ES and we always felt safe walking in the area. Others mentioned old furniture and TV issues. Our furniture in 1105, while not being brand new, was nice and not showing any damage. We had 2 large flat screen TVs that were great. We would like to see a safe added to the room for any valuables. And if you have the opportunity, book a balcony room. Shop around and get the best price possible. The view is incredible and well worth the difference in price. We look forward to returning to San Diego and the Embassy Suites soon. Many THANKS to the Staff for another great stay!

Everything was perfect in regards to the hotel. Service, the room, the breakfast, and all the amenities were simply wonderful. We didn't have to use the car in order to take in the sights(we passed on Sea World and the Zoo this go round). We limited our sightseeing to downtown, took the harbor cruise and a ferry to Coronado. My only issue is that for $241 a night(two nights, with parking, the final bill came to $601) I feel like I could have had similar for less. But like anything else-if you end up having a relaxing and fun time, whatever you pay might be worth it. I think the rates were raised since, of all things, a convention of firefighters (I was told 22,000 from across the country were in town) was being held. The hotel was crowded but it never interfered with anything we did. If I have one minor gripe it is seeing the \"deterioration\" of the happy hour over the years at this chain. The snacks are chips, pretzels, and popcorn. I remember times when hot food, such as mini tacos or at least chips with salsa were served. Maybe each Embassy is different but just seems expenses are being cut maybe a bit too much. Also, I have been spoiled by the fact other chains of this nature are including Hi-Def TV's in the room these days; this hotel does NOT have them. Obviously, we didn't go to watch TV but one note of warning if you do chill in front of the tube: Apparently, the cable system here is on an East Coast feed. When we were winding down at night, we noticed that everything was on 3 hours earlier than listed in the USA today.

At first everything seemed fine - nice rooms, decent location, etc. On the day of our wedding rehearsal, my 86 year old father had not shown up yet to the hotel to check in. He was driving from central California and does not have a cell phone. So, I left a message with the staff at the front desk asking them to contact me when he arrived. Well, hours passed and I never received a call. I called back several times to the front desk to make sure he had not arrived. I was given the room number he was supposed to be in and I called his room several times. No answer. Before we left for the rehearsal to be held at 4:30 p.m., I again went to the front desk, gave them my phone number, and yet again asked them to contact me when he arrived. Our wedding party went to the rehearsal and then on to the rehearsal dinner - still no dad. We called several more times to the front desk to find out if he had arrived. At one point, I was crying on the phone with them because I was so worried about my father possibly being lost or having been hurt somehow since being late is NOT like him. Each time we called, we were told he had not checked in yet. My wedding party began calling the California Highway Patrol, AAA, relatives, friends, etc. to find out what had happened to my father. Needless to say, I was a wreck. When we finally got back to the hotel after the rehearsal dinner, one of my best friends actually got into her car and began driving in the direction my dad would have been coming from. By the way, ten hours had passed since my father had left from home at 11:00 a.m. (for a four to five hour drive). I decided to call his room again. By this time, it is about 9:00 p.m. My father answered the phone!! He had been at the hotel for hours but had been told by staff when he checked in at 4:15ish that I had left already. No call was made to me. No phone number was given to him to call. Each time our party called the front desk to find out if he had checked in, we were told he had not. If any of you out there have gotten married or been part of a wedding recently, you know the stress of just planning this event, let alone having to deal with the emotional turmoil of something like this. When management was contacted, they essentially took no responsibility for this and even suggested my 86 year old father somehow snuck into a room on his own without getting any keys. How he was suppossed to have done this is beyond me, but that is what the night manager, Ms. Willes, suggested. She also claimed my father actually arrived at 2:15 p.m. (impossible even though she claims it is true) and therefore it was the a.m. team's fault and not hers. She had the gall to argue with me on the phone about this on the night before my wedding. The general manager for San Diego, John Smith, actually decided to call me ON my wedding day to essentially confirm what Ms. Willes stated. Thankfully my bridesmaids handled these calls for me since there was no way I wanted my wedding day to be ruined by such lies. Basically, this is what it comes down to: if you actually want decent customer service, don't go to this hotel. They claim to be a full service, upscale hotel, but they can't even relay simple messages. Because of their incompetence and even simple lack of compassion for another human being, my 86 year old father missed his only child's wedding rehearsal and rehearsal dinner. My mother is dead so this was a very big deal to me as well, not to mention I thought that something terrible had happened to my father. The day was RUINED. I can't recommend this hotel to anyone.

I stayed three nights for about $137/night, a rate which I found using the hotel rate search feature on this site.

The Amtrak station is about a five-minute walk north of the hotel, and the trolley stops there, but there is a second (Orange Line) stop just about 200 yards east of the hotel as well. Initially, I considered driving down from LA, but after learning they charge $29/night for parking, I figured I could save a little by riding the Amtrak down instead. Many hotels in downtown San Diego charge similar rates for parking. They've also done away with the courtesy shuttle. Last time I stayed here, they took me back and forth from the train station, but not this time. When I walked up, the valets/doormen looked to be standing around with nothing to do. I was thinking since they seem to have so much time on their hands, maybe one of them could have helped me out with a ride from the station, but so it goes.

I was told yes, your reservation is fine. I informed the front desk I was driving down from L.A. and would be there by 10. We arrived at 9:30pm.Our Bay View, Balcony room had been sold by the time we arrived. In less than 3 hours our room had been sold. We were given a room instead with no balcony, a broken TV, and a refrigerator that wheezed like a chain smoker. The next night we were moved to a Bay View, Balcony View right outside the elevators.

NOTE: THIS HOTEL HAS ONE OF THE NOISEST INTERIORS DUE TO KIDS RUNNING WILD TO THE ELEVATORS IN THE MORNING, SCREAMING. It is a very loud, very difficult place to feel comfortable in. The rooms have a dated feel to them and our second room had stains for who-knows-what spilled on them \u2013 looked like a major party had gone down in the room. Granted, the hotel did give me a discount of my two nights, a token if you will for completely screwing up my first night\u2019s reservation. Yet the service was still bad, the rooms still looking like they had been through at least five or more fraternity parties and the food so-so. Yes, you save on food with a family yet the lines for omelettes are on average 15 \u2013 20 minutes in the morning.

As with all other vacations, I placed my purchases in shopping bags and placed the bags on the couch in the room. We went back to the Convention Center everyday and bought stuff. On Friday, my fiance bought me 4 more frenzies and that evening we opened them up to see what they were (for non-toy collectors out there - the items were blind boxed meaning that with 22 different characters, you don't know what's in the box until you open it). I was very happy with the frenzies I got that night (Latte, Skeletrino, Sandy and Superhero Boy) and placed them with the ones I had gotten on Wednesday night. Saturday morning, we returned to the Convention and my fiance bought some toys for his friend. Because we didn't want to carry everything the whole day, we decided to drop off the purchases at the hotel. When we got back to the room, which was at about 1:30 - 2:00, my fiance decided to organize all his purchases so I thought it would be good to do the same for mine. I opened my shopping bag to find one of my Bearbricks missing and 2 of my 6 frenzies missing. I looked in the frenzie boxes to see what characters were there and noticed that everything was there except for Latte and Skeletrino which I had just gotten the night before!! How could toys that I put away Friday night go missing by Saturday afternoon?! Security was called and the cleaning person said that she didn't take anything. Yeah like she'd admit to it. Once again, how did toys I put away Friday night go missing by Saturday afternoon?! These toys were small and the cleaning person probably thought I wouldn't notice they were gone. Why would you risk your job to take toys from someone?! I was so upset and felt so violated. When you stay at a hotel, you trust that your things will stay safe in your room. You shouldn't have to lock up every little thing. I left a tip on the bed every morning for the cleaning person for the cleaning of the room ... NOT so that she could go and steal from me! So many vacations at so many different hotels and I have never had my stuff stolen until now. I was unbelievably upset. Thank goodness I had my fiance there to handle things and to console me. They may have only taken collectible toys but the mere fact that anything was taken at all doesn't speak well for the hotel or the security. They totally violated our trust. From that day on, no matter how small the item, I locked everything in my suitcase. For all travelers, beware the embassy suites. The cleaning staff has sticky fingers.

Visited Coronado, La Jolla, Pacific Beach, Mission Beach, and Dog Beach. If you love dogs and have never been to Dog Beach (at Ocean Beach), I highly recommend a visit.

Better than most Embassys. Had 3-4 computers and free printing. The downsides. 1. Breakfast was below average. Messy floors and tables. Food was nothing special and they ran out of several items. 2. Our room and the hotel in general, are in need of a facelift. Moldy smells, dirty floors, walls and kitchen serving area. 3. $29/day parking fee. This seems outrageous. 4.

I went to the front desk and explained the situation. The lady was also polite and took the charges off the bill. This took some time as she had to remove them individually for seven nights. When she printed a new bill for me, I only glanced to see that the charges had been removed. After checking emails, I looked at the bill one final time to see that I was being charged $2989 + tax for the seven night stay. I logged into Hilton.com and printed off the original confirmation which I took with me to the front desk. The lady behind the counter did not know what had happened and she was unable to fix it until her manager got in. This was really not a problem because we were not planning on checking out for a few hours. Two hours late, I returned to the desk and a different woman was there. I explained who I was and she called her manager who was still working on the bill. He told her that it would be sent to my room when he was finished. It was up there within and hour. This was a hassle and while everyone was polite, there was no apology offered. The good parts of the hotel were the full breakfast and the complimentary manager's reception. These areas got quite full (it was high season and also ComiCon was there at the same time) but, the people were always friendly and they worked quickly. For kids, there was also a nice area for kids to watch movies and a lady making Italian Sodas for them which never got too busy. In the morning, a man made balloon animals. He did excellent work. He even made sure to tell us that he was being paid and in no way did he expect tips. I thought that was execptional. The indoor pool area and exercise exquipment were very nice. They did run out of pool towels and it took 45 minutes and many phone calls (I counted at least six different people calling) to finally receive towels. Housekeeping was spotty as appears to be the trend in most hotels. Our bathroom floor was noticably dirty for the length of the stay but, the beds were always made and the room was usually ready by 12:00. The valet service was probably the worst. There are no self parking options at the hotel and the cost is $28 not including tips. My son was in a day camp at Sea World and the back-up with the valet made us late on one occasion. We ended up coming down at 7:45am to get our car by 8:00. (As we found out the hard way Sea World camp waits for no man!) There were times when the wait was ten minutes and there were only two people waiting. One morning, they even had mixed our car up with another. They brought us the wrong car!!! When I told them it wasn't my car, they said that was the ticket I gave them. I am not sure what the point was but, I didn't think that entitled me to take someone else's car. ; ) After describing the car and telling them that there was no key ring, they then decided that they would need proof in order to give me my car. Really no big deal,I had the registration in the glove bod but, 5 minutes earlier I could have driven off in SOMEONE ELSE\"S car.

Very poorly run.\u201d", "Author": "tboneps", "ReviewID": "UR17618915", "Content": "I'll start with the good: Location: Although some on here have complained about the location, it all depends upon what you are doing in the city. The hotel is walking distance to the marina, the seaport and all of its restaurants and shops, Horton Plaza, and the Midway. Yes, you will hear Amtrak. You will hear Amtrak from every downtown location, though. Views: Excellent. Our balcony overlooked the Coronado Bridge and the bay. It was beautiful, and we were able to watch the Fourth of July fireworks from there while the babies slept. It was terrific. Next, the 'mixed bag': Breakfast/Manager's Reception: The included breakfast and reception each evening adds a great deal of value to your stay. On Saturday, we couldn't enjoy either. The lines were wrapped all the way around the atrium, and there were no tables. Lines like that are no places for two year old twins. On Sunday, we knew better and went down to breakfast at 7AM. The lines were smaller, but still substantial. We did get a table and high chairs, though. The food is good, and there are healthy choices. The manager's reception on Sunday was not busy at all. We went down for sodas and some chips. A warning, though, chips and pretzels and drinks are all that is free during the reception. Some very bad pizza was $2 a slice (a decent price), but really inedible. And, the awful: I booked what is called the \"Suite Shopping Package\" after much review of all of the available rates. For our purposes, this provided the best value for our dollar. it was to include: 1. a 'Special Welcome Gift' at check in; 2. a $25 gift card per night to Westfield Horton Plaza; 3. a Starbucks Coffee Mug with a free Starbucks drink, and 4. complementary valet parking with full in and out privileges. The problem began at check-in when they had no idea what the \"Suite Shopping Package\" package was. I find this hard to believe, since it was customized for that particular hotel. If they had no idea, it is very poor planning and training. The person checking me in told me I would be charged an additional 28.99 per day for valet parking. I told her that it was included in the pkg. (and fortunately I had printed off the package details to take with me). She said, OK, I'll take care of that. I told her the other items could just be delivered to the room, but that we planned on using the Westfield gift cards for dinner that evening, so please don't delay it too long. About an hour before we planned to go to dinner, I called down to inquire. Oh, we'll send everything right up. They sent up a Starbucks mug and some coupons for discounts at various Westfield merchants. At this point, I decided to go down to the front desk. It took the gentleman 30 minutes and THREE different trips to 'talk to my manager' to get the gift cards. (Why on earth didn't the manager ever come out and deal with this directly?) Anyhow, I got the gift cards and told the agent that when they determined what the welcome gift is, just send it up. We're travelling with our infant twins, and this was really taking up too much time. The worst part of all of this is that I was made to feel like I was being petty or demanding. I was simply asking for (and I shouldn't have had to do that) what my rate promised me. I really did put a lot of research into the rates, and with the gift cards for dinner, the free coffee, and the free valet parking, this rate was less expensive than even the discount Internet rate. The welcome gift never materialized, and the valet charges - of course - were on the folio. I decided not to pursue the welcome gift, as it was just pointless and very annoying by this time. The valet charges were removed, but - again \u2013 it was yet another trip to the front desk. I would have phoned down to have the charges removed, but the phones in our room did not work on Sunday morning. I reported this from the house phone, but it was never fixed. This hotel has potential, but it is very poorly run. One final item: The swimming pool is on the first floor and just outside the four elevators. The floor in the elevator waiting area was always soaked with water from dripping swimsuits, and so were the floors of the elevators. During my lengthy time at the front desk, I heard two complaints to the front desk about this - including one from an elderly woman whose husband had fallen earlier in one of the elevators. She was told they hear this complaint often but there is nothing they can do. They will put up a 'wet floor' sign, though. Good grief, people. This is California.

The Embassy Suites is convenient to get to from the San Diego airport and about 4, long, blocks away from the Convention Center.

The hotel does have a laminated sheet noting the \"peak\" times for breakfast and they are. They had potatoes, sausage, bacon, eggs, pancakes, waffels along with pastries, and bread. There was a made to order waffel/egg station along with juice, coffee/tea, and soft drinks. The Manager's Reception had well-liquor, red & white wine, and for beer, there was Michelob Amber Bock, Rolling Rock, Bud, and Budlight, all on draft. There were munchies available, chips, pretzels, nachos, popcorn, pizza could be purchased for $2. Both of these features were adequate. I found the staff to be very accomodating. As mentioned in most other reviews, vallet parking is $28 a day, not including tip. The valet crew parked and retrieved vehicles fast. I did store my bags upon check in and check out without incident. I did ask for a wake-up call one night and didn't get it the following morning. I stayed at an Embassy Suites in San Jose and that got me hooked. It was a king room. For this trip I got two beds since a friend of mine met up with me and crashed at the hotel. The living room in the double-room seemed significantly smaller. This was probably to add extra room for the additional bed. The room didn't seem out-dated to me at all. Everything in the room worked. I was upgraded to a bay-view, I'm not sure what the fuss is about with a bay view, it didn't seem spectacular to me. Perhaps I had the wrong bay view. I was on a higher floor away from the elevators as requested. I could barely hear what was happening in the open atrium each morning. The bedding was satisfactory. We did eat/drink at the Pacific Fish Company bar a few nights. Meredith and Kelly at the bar were fantastic. Meredith is extremely friendly and punctual, Kelly also friendly and punctual and makes a great bloody mary. The food was good, a bit pricey, that is to be expected for a hotel restaurant. The hotel is a distance away from the Gaslamp District. I went to a game @ Petco park and walked there. After the game, I did take the trolly back for $1.25 one way. The stop is a block away from the hotel entrance. The Gaslamp area is fun with lots to see, do and eat. I stayed at the Marriott Marina the last time the convention was there. The big advantage the Marriott has is the proximity to the convention center. Other than that, they are roughly equal in services and ammenities. I paid a discounted convention rate of $239/night. The California taxes are crazy. This cost of the hotel does not include the valet, or the $9.90 fee for Internet service. By the way you can't have multiple computers on the same paid room internet account, I find that ridiculous.

Then, I experienced the construction noise first hand. Management should really block rooms that are affected by the construction because it is very loud. I had to pack up all my stuff and have my room moved to another floor. Internet access was choppy at best. A few days later, I had a bad leak in the shower, which they couldn't fix.

My keys de-activated, the clothes dryer wasn't functioning properly (took me three hours to dry one load of laundry) and I also had issues with the business center as well. Everyone apologized but at some point, words just didn't seem to help so I involved the manager, who gave me a gift certificate for a future stay. I got the feeling that the staff was so used to apologizing for problems, they really didn't try to address the issues and make the guest feel better about a bad situation. I was so frustrated that I could hold my tongue no longer. I told the manager that if I returned and had a similar experience that I'd rather just not come back at all, but he assured me that my experience was not the norm. I'd like to believe him.

I did have pleasant stays the last few times so I may give it another chance after the construction is complete but this past stay was just terrible.

I would rate above average to excellent. We really enjoyed our stay. We requested a bayview room...we were given a corner room on the 7th floor with great views of the Seaport Village and Harbor. For the most part...I thought our room was very quiet and private. Our room was clean, spacious, had a bar sink, microwave and small fridge in the galley area. It had a working desk or table in the livingroom for your laptop or if you wanted take-out one night. What I liked about our room was the big huge sink area in the bath AND one outside the bathroom. This way, my husband had one area, I had on area for our \"stuff.\" Yes, there is some very minor evidence that the Embassy is currently renovating their rooms. But I do not think you would notice this unless you are on the upper floors and you are deciding to take an afternoon nap at between 1-3 p.m. We did this one day..there was only a very faint tapping to be heard. The only other way we knew there was some construction going on at this hotel was reading about this on this website and a small discreet sign in the elevator. I have read here and agree...the beds are VERY comfortable and LOTS of really good fluffy pillows. I see complaints were written about the noise of the a/c or heat. I did not notice the noise of the fan more than any other hotel I have been in. Comments on the free breakfast buffet and a happy hour (snacks and drinks). The breakfust buffet is a real value-add considering that eating an equivalent breakfast out might run you about $15pp. Also the Embassy breakfast is probably better than you can get at any Hampton Inn or similar type of hotel that includes a continental breakfast. You can have an omelet made to order...which is more than I have seen offered elsewhere. Now...here's the catch. Get there early if you are aggravated by crowds or people who think that the food will all of a sudden dissappear or that the Embassy will shut down the breakfast area without notice and they will be out of luck. I think you know what I mean. You still get A LOT of people who think that because it's \"free,\" means they can behave as though it is a \"free-for-all.\" The Embassy must have about 7-8 people , possibly more, working the lounge/breakfast area , keeping it clean, clearing tables, and keeping it \"fresh.\" We went about 7:30 daily and it was a bit hectic and somewhat aggravating for us. Once seated and away from the hordes, you can somewhat relax but it is always difficult for my husband and I to relax while watching people act like it is their last meal. We went earlier on our last day and it was pleasant. None of the craziness. I cannot say enough about how polite and courteous the staff and breakfast crew is. Now about the manager's reception: no biggie. We went downstairs to check it out and decided to pass. Well liquor and nachos and some \"freezer\" pizza. Save your calories and don't risk any headaches with the well-liquor. Granted it's a nice idea...but not for my husband and I. There is a charge for WiFi [$9.95 per day]. If you can get by without your own laptop in your room, you can use the business center, internet is free. Okay..so you think that the WiFi charge is a bit much? Well...the Embassy makes it up with the free breakfast. [Go outside and order an omelet and see how much that will cost you! ] I did not experience the connectivity issues that others had commented about. The WiFi worked flawlessly. The pool and jacuzzi is average to small size, but the their gym is a treat with treadmills, elipticals and dumbell weights. One of the nicer hotel gyms I have seen for this class hotel. This hotel is 15 min walk from Gaslamp, 1/2 block from their trolley, 10 min walk to the harbor excursions and Seaport Village. Starbucks is attached to hotel downstairs. Some comments on the hotel's Pacific Fish Company restaurant. The PFC will mostly seat people in the bar area, which is noisy and cold. For some reason the air conditioning is cranked in there. The sushi is mediocre at best. My husband had sushi there one night and it didn't look so hot...kind of amateurish (we eat A LOT of sushi). That made me reluctant to try any of the fish. They have a smoked beef salad which is to die for. The Martha's Vineyard Salad is also very good. The food is overall very good tavern/bar food. Again, service is excellent and waitstaff professional. There are so many places to eat in San Diego that I would say there is no need to add this restaurant to your list as \"must dine here.\" I will say that the restaurant is convenient if you come back in late from a day of touring or whatever and you are too tired to venture out much further. You can get a decent meal. A comment..this restaurant also serves the hotel room service. The prices for room service are at least $1.00 more per item, there is a $3.00 room service fee and they add 19% gratuity to the bill. There is clearly stated on the room service menu. Parking is $28 a day without any in/out fee. Now stop acting like this is a big deal. Guess what ? You are in the city. Parking is expensive ANYWHERE and most of the hotels are charging $25 to $30 a day. [I did all this research before I went.] One note, we are not 100% sure but we think one of the valets possibly scratched our rental. We did notice until the vehicle was at Avis and they pointed it out. That can happen with any valet service, just be aware. One review commented on crazy/rude busboys and valets who were falling over themselves to get tips. We did NOT see this. Again, the valets were all very pleasant and extremely polite...as were the rest of the staff. My last few comments. The train!! When reading the reviews about the Hampton Inn and Holiday Inn Bayside...I got a bit freaked out because people were commenting the fact that you can hear the train all night long. Guess what? We heard the train as well in our hotel. Talking to some locals, they indicated EVERYONE who lives or stays downtown can hear the the train at night. Someone even commented that it is some age old agenda by Amtrak with the City of San Diego. We didn't hear the train Sunday night, but did hear it through the week. We got used to it. So be prepared! I chose this hotel because it was slightly less expensive than the Manchester Grand Hyatt and I wanted a suite style room. I walked over to the the Manchester to check it out. It is A LOT more plush and caters to business people and older traveling couples. You will pay for this though. Also, parking is $30 per day there. But looking at the Manchester Grand Hyatt and relation to the train tracks...I am sure they hear the train at night as well. Overall, we had a fantastic experience at The Embassy Suites...will be returning here. ONE MORE THING: Go to the Fish Market Restaurant (near the USS Midway Museum) and eat at The Top of the Market.

The suite feature is nice, but the sitting area only has a window overlooking the elevator bank in our room (404). The bedroom overlooked the bay and was worth the $314 that we paid for the room (AAA rate). Everything was clean and well maintained in our room (except the air return for the AC made noice). The microwave and fridge are good features, as were the pull out sofa and desk in the sitting area. I loved sitting on the balcony overlooking the bay and Coronoda Bridge. We had a perfect view of Seaport Village from our 4th floor rooms. Housekeeping button on the phone doesn't work. Wonder why they don't forward those calls to the operator?? We enjoyed the free manager's happy hour each evening. Free drinks (mixed drinkis, beer, wine, and sodas). Also free chips and cheese dip. Don't pay $2 for the pizza slices - my son wouldn't touch them either time I bought him a slice (and he loves pizza). A hot breakfast buffet is included in the rate. Pretty decent food. The omelets were not as good as I hoped, but the fried eggs and bacon were very satisfying. Good variety of cereals, pasteries, eggs, meats, and fruits are put out. The coffee was only OK, so I went to the Starbucks attached to the hotel each morning for my fix of caffeine. Don't order from the hotel restaurant - Pacific Fish Company. We ordered dinner at 8:15 pm on a Sunday night (Easter Sunday). It took them 45 minutes to delivery our cold, overcooked dinner. They were out of cheese cake, so we got carrot cake and creme brulee. The carrot cake was \"factory made\" and the creme brulee was overcooked. The crab cakes were made from dry, stringy crab that got stuck in my teeth and weren't worth finishing. The corn salsa was very good. My son wouldn't touch his mac and cheese, saying they were terrible. The ice cream had melted a lot before it got here. And the best part - 20 hours after we put the trays outside of our room they were still there.

I decided to stay at the Embassy Suites Downtown after extensive research, and I based my decision on location, price, and amenities. The location was good, across the street from Seaport Village, the U.S.S. Midway, and about six blocks from the Gaslamp District. The walk to the Gaslamp District seems safe (which was important to me, since I was a 25-year-old woman traveling alone), although I only walked it before sunset. There are fewer pedestrians the closer you get to the hotel, but the area seems safe and frequented by locals taking their dogs to the dog park I passed. Technically you could walk to the zoo and Balboa park (apparently it takes about 45 minutes), but since my ankles were giving me problems I took a cab, as recommended by the hotel\u2019s concierge. It was convenient, but expensive. It was about $12 each way. This might be more worthwhile if you aren\u2019t the only one in the cab like I was. The price for my room (I paid about $230 per night, including tax) is expensive for one person, but would be a great deal for a family, especially with the complimentary breakfast. I had good experiences both days I ate breakfast in the lobby. The lobby is pleasant to sit in, decorated in foliage and goldfish ponds. The size of the breakfast area is the biggest I\u2019ve seen in a hotel that serves a free breakfast; usually I have to fight for the toaster and squeeze around other bodies standing around trying to get their food. Not so here. And the selection was very good with hot items like pancakes and eggs, donuts, cereal, toast, bagels, hot chocolate, juice, and fresh fruit. Not being a coffee drinker, I especially liked the hot chocolate that is machine brewed and comes out frothy, plus they provide cinnamon, vanilla, and creamer to add to it (maybe it was meant for the coffee, but oh well). Lastly, I was so surprised by the good service of the employees manning the breakfast! Both days someone asked me if I had everything I needed. On the second day I asked the lady for another box of cereal and milk, and she brought it right out so I could continue reading the paper. The room is large, and for one person felt luxuriously spacious. I liked being able to lounge on the couch or in bed to watch TV, and I\u2019m glad the window opened to let in fresh air. There\u2019s a vanity with sink outside the bathroom in addition to the sink and counter space in the bathroom. Overall I felt safe staying here. I was never impressed by the service or friendliness of the front desk employees, but everyone else I encountered were more professional (like the housekeepers and the bellboy). The biggest annoyance I encountered is that they\u2019re remodeling the fitness room to make it bigger, and the noise of the construction (which they start around 10 and continue until about 4 or 5) was super loud! My room was on the same side of the hotel as the construction\u2014but six floors up! And I could hear the construction as if it were just one floor below me. One afternoon I returned to the hotel for a nap after a busy morning, but I found the noise was so bad that I asked the front desk if I could move rooms or something so I could get some rest. As I said before, none of the front desk employees impressed me much at all, but I do give the girl a tiny bit of credit for finally offering me earplugs, which I accepted. On the bright side, a larger exercise room will be good for future guests, since it was inadequately small before\u2026but I wish I could have used it myself and that it wasn\u2019t so noisy through the day.", "Date": "May 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haverhill, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cFriendly Service & Good Location\u201d", "Author": "s25843", "ReviewID": "UR7428827", "Content": "Let me start off by saying that I am a Hilton Honors Gold VIP member, and a Starwood Preferred Guest Gold Member.

The bar area had a sink, microwave, refrigerator and a large table. The windows opened enough to let some fresh air in. When traveling with children a complimentary breakfast is a must have amenity. The variety and quick and efficient service was much appreciated. The earlier you go the less crowded it is, but even then you don\u2019t have to wait too long. The eating area was clean and offered two points of interest to the kids. First are the well fed fish in the ponds and then the turtle house where you can see the occupants taking a sun bath before diving in to join the fish. We ordered room service several times and while it wasn\u2019t outstanding my kids ate the chicken tenders and mac and cheese like it was their first time. The sushi and sandwiches are good choices. I do agree the front desk staff is not very friendly or helpful but the concierge and the valet parking attendants are great. One valet even ran back to my car (which he just parked) to get my cell phone and delivered it to my room. Very nice. Two complaints: there are only two washers and dryers in the entire hotel; two are on the 11th floor and two on the 12th floor. There are no change machines and often the soap dispenser (only one on 11?) is empty which means a trip to the lobby. This also meant NUMEROUS trips between floors checking for availability. The pool area often lacked dry towels and the chlorine was an eye killer. Very strong, but I guess that\u2019s a good thing in a hotel pool. The location was fantastic, right across the street from Seaport Village( try the carousel), a couple blocks from the USS Midway and Maritime Museum( five kinds of sailing vessels you can tour, not crowded and kid pleasing). We had friends staying at the Marriott who were awakened every hour by passing trains. We slept like babies.

The hotel is very nice, with spacious rooms and a nice lobby wirh a large area for enjoying either the complimentary breakfast or snacks in the afternoon. Each room has a separate bedroom with a pull-out bed in the living room/dining room. The hotel is within walking distance of Seaport Village, Horton Plaza Mall, and the USS Midway, as well the Gaslamp Quarter. We enjoyed the view of the bay, and it was a treat to see the cruise ships come in every morning. There is a nice restaurant in the hotel, as well as a Starbucks, a deli, and a small convenience store which are out the back door of the hotel. There is also a complimentary shuttle to and from the airport, or to the area for boarding the cruise ships. There is also a trolley stop about a block from the hotel which will take you around town, of you can connect to a trolley which will take you to Tijuana, Mexico. The only drawback for adults staying in the hotel is that it is a very popular spot for families with small children. If unattended, they enjoy playing with the elevators, which can mean a wait if you are trying to either leave or return to your room.", "Date": "May 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfield, CT", "Title": "\u201cWent with Small Expectations, but Better than Expected\u201d", "Author": "TravelerfromCT", "ReviewID": "UR4998202", "Content": "This was one of our nicer Embassy Suites experiences.

We would not have expected our room to be ready, so we pre checked in. I was using my hilton honors points so the room was supposed to be a city view lower level. at check-in we we told that we had been upgraded to a bay view upper floor--the kids (and myself) were thrilled) We checked our luggage in with no issues. plus with the attached starbucks we reenergized before going out to explore. the hotel location is great. if you were a light packer and the weather was good you could walk (about 2 miles) to the airport. and it would be a nice walk! you are close to the maritime muesuem, the midway, seaport village, gas light quarter, the ferry to coranado. We we finally got to the room later that afternoon the room was clean and not \"worn-out\" as in previous threads. we had a corner room with a king.. for some great reason my kids don't mind sleeping on the pull-out...in the PM there is a mngrs cocktail hour very nice with free drinks and snacks. Breakfast was not as good as I've had with other embassy's I suggest you order eggs iinstead of the precooked--then you know they will be hot. We had not picked up our rental at the airport yet (would be later in the pm) so we rechecked our luggage again. when we were ready around 4pm we pick-up our luggage and the hotel shuttle delivered us to the hertz office at the airport. overall we had a great time.", "Date": "April 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, OH", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay\u201d", "Author": "greenberry", "ReviewID": "UR4591133", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for one night and were extremely pleased with the location and service we received. We arrived at noon and asked if we could store our luggage and return our rental car - not only did they let us park in the valet area for half an hour to unload our car, but they also had a room ready so we got to settle in well before the posted check-in time. We returned our car and had them come pick us up with their airport shuttle and that worked out perfectly (plus it saved us the $22 parking fee). Hotel is beautiful, especially the lobby area. We were pleasantly surprised by the full bar for the cocktail hour in the evening! Every staff member we met was extremely helpful and friendly, from the front desk to the cleaning crew. We walked to Seaport Harbor and to the Gaslamp Quarter - hotel is in a very good location, right across the street from Seaport. Complimentary breakfast was outstanding, with plenty of choices for any type of appetite.
