She wasn't the best dealer, and i did lose, but i didn't mind too much. Bar prices are very reasonable too. I got a vodka and coke at The Mirage for $8, so i was highly surprised to see this cost $3 at Binion's. The bar staff were also very friendly and polite, and were very gracious about tips too, that was nice. Now don't expect anything fancy like The Mirage etc, but really if you are in Fremont Street then you just really need to pop in. The place is steeped so much in Vegas history.

We had a 2 weeks holiday in Las Vegas. Coming downtown away from the strip is a breath of fresh air! We did it nearly everynight! The machines are fun and pay out way way way more then the Strip! As its a smaller casino all of the machines are played well, which gives better pay outs. And the drinks are extremely frequent. Every 10 minutes! (Rosie is a fabulous cocktail waitress here). On the strip you had to wait half an hour to have an order taken then another half and hour to get your drink, and that was in most of the hotels. Downtown is completely different. Even when you buy a drink its one fifth of the price of the strip. The steakhouse looked great upstairs, but we didnt get a chance to eat in it. It has a fabulous view too. There is a little Binions diner on the casino floor. Its so good and really cheap. Always a queue to get in but so worth the wait. You can have your photo taken with the million dollars for free which is something they would charge you at least $10 for on the strip.

The first thing I did was get on TripAdvisor and read the reviews-- I was kind of nervous about staying at this hotel after reading the reviews. BUT... it wasn't so bad. We did have a room in the newer tower (newer being probably decorated in the 70s). Our carpet did look pretty new though. The decor was shabby chic from the 70s. Yes, they still had an old tube TV and white laminate furniture, but.. overall, it was no where near as frightening as the prior reviews made it seem. To me, this hotel was a typical 2/3 star hotel. We did need extra towels and housekeeping brought them up within 10 minutes of our call. The overall feeling of the room was clean (just dated). As I mentioned before The GN is my favorite downtown hotel, but... if I ever have to stay somewhere else downtown, I don't think Binion's is a bad deal-- it was fine for the price we paid and for its location.

The TV was an old Magnavox which was slow to turn on and only got 14 channels (one of which was the keno results from down in the casino). When we were the ice machine on our floor did not work for three of the four days we were there (even though we called on the first day and we met others who called as well). The bedding definitely needs to be replaced. The comforter has begun to get holes. The drapes also needed replaced, the backing had come off in spots and the light did shine through. The toilet only flushed liquids. For solids (like a #2 or toilet paper) we had to fill a trash can in the tub and then empty it into the bowl.

This hotel is very old. On one website there was a comment that said \"Recently renovated in 1952\". We thought this was hilarious. All of the furnishings are just that....50 years old. Although like mostly everyone says...it is kept clean. Check in was the quickest I have ever had in Vegas, about two minutes. The first room we had had felt for carpeting with multiple old iron stains and a very old TV with no reception. We arrived very late so we immediatly went down to gamble and when we came back to sleep we immediatly noticed that the bed was seriously as hard as a rock. We slept there anyway for as long as we could....about six hours. All of the next day our backs and shoulders were killing us. The next morning we went to the desk and asked for a different room because of the bed. The clerk was very helpful and just nodded as if she knew about the beds. She gave us keys to another room. The second room was the smallest hotel room I have ever seen. Maybe 8X8....not kidding. Although the bed was slightly softer it was a little bigger than a twin size bed for two people. So basically we had to sleep on top of each other. Now on to the casino. This is one of our favorites in Las Vegas because the slots seem to always be loose and the tables hot with low limits. This hotel is dead center of all the action on Fremont street. We did eat one morning at the coffee shop and the food was terrible and very overpriced. So overall this is a very old hotel that is kept clean but has the worst beds possible. I would not recommend staying here longer than two nights because the uncomfortable sleeping will make you so tired that you wont enjoy your time in Vegas. But if you are looking for a room at rock bottom prices and can sleep on very hard beds then go for it.

Also, I got a smoking room, which was not what I requested, as many others did. I checked in at midnight on a Friday, and the place seemed pretty full. so I probably got whatever was left.

I called maintenance, they said they'd send someone up, and it worked fine when I came back that night.

I've also stayed at Fitzgerald's and they're pretty much the same, save that Binion's has quicker elevators. The room was a bit worn, but for a place to keep your stuff and sleep off the previous night, it's perfectly acceptable. Do not expect luxury or any extra amenities when staying here in a regular room at a discount rate. Downtown is all about some of the last remaining old Vegas vibe, and convenience - there's no way you could visit 6 or 8 separate casinos and a few bars in one night on the strip, without taking many taxicab rides - - but downtown, it's all in walking distance. It's not glitzy, it's not luxury, no floor shows or roller-coasters, just gambling, drinking, people-watching, the Fremont light shows, and regular people generally having a great time. If you want to stay downtown but step it up a star rating or two, check out the Golden Nugget, and their new pool area. While the hotel itself was just the basics, I can say that the staff at Binion's were very gracious, helpful and friendly. The coffee shop downstairs is a bonus if you like breakfast any time of day. They do offer free parking, but it's at one of the two hotel sides (and your room might be on the other side, so prepare for a bit of a walk). I thought I read that they had wi-fi, but couldn't get any sort of signal in my room. I didn't check out the pool area, so I don't have an opinion on that. I would recommend this hotel to someone who didn't want any extra frills. If you're driving to this hotel (or any downtown hotel) from the airport, I suggest driving up the interstate and taking the 2nd downtown exit, as opposed to driving all the way up the strip...

Oh! And then we took some friends up to eat at the Binions ranch steakhouse (which i had eaten there twice before and was impressed!).

We arrived around 2:30 pm on Thursday and there was no line at all for check-in. The room was pretty basic-- old furniture and an old TV, but clean and quite comfortable. My only complaint was there was VERY little water pressure in the shower. This may have been a problem in our room only, however, as my friend staying on another floor said hers was fine. Housekeeping did a great job and honored all our requests quickly and efficiently. Our room cost us a total of $89 for all three nights! If you need to be pampered, this is probably not the place for you, but if you're looking for a clean, comfortable room to crash in while you enjoy Fremont Street, Binions is definately a great deal. The casino was great -- $5.00 tables even on Friday and Saturday night, lots of good video poker, and reasonably quick cocktail service. There aren't a lot of food options here -- the steakhouse is quite good, but I would give the coffee shop about a \"C\" rating. Your only other option at Binions is a couple of snack bars offering hot dogs and burgers, etc. This really isn't a problem, though, since the surrounding hotels offer some excellent dining possibilities. Our trip was mostly a poker-playing trip. We expected a lot from the poker room and we were certainly not disappointed. The tournament poker room was great -- the dealers and tournament directors were friendly and extremely knowledgeable. They have a pretty extensive tournament schedule -- there were at least six per day, usually attracting 3 or 4 or more tables each. They have also recently opened a new, separate and very nice poker room used exclusively for cash games. Can't say enough about how much we enjoyed playing at Binions. All in all, an excellent trip.

Sink was plugged up pretty badly; not much in the way of hot water for the shower. HVAC though adjustable was not really changing temps much at all. TV was very old but provided a great picture as the signal feed was superb. My room was a corner unit slightly away from the freemont street mayhem. Yes, it's noisy until after midnight if you have the wrong room assignment but for me it was pretty quiet aside from the loud HVAC which provided some nice white noise. Valet was only staffed by two or three people who double as the bell desk but extremely attentive and friendly.

All in all, it is a budget accomodation and what it lacks can be made up at one of the other casinos who are more than happy to welcome you as well. :-)", "Date": "March 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midwest", "Title": "\u201cHad a Good Experience at Binion's\u201d", "Author": "Clarkson7", "ReviewID": "UR13970672", "Content": "I (solo) stayed at Binion's February 27 & 28.

I first wanted to stay in a hostel, but then I saw it was only 35$/night at Binion's on the nights I was in Vegas. At this price, I decided to give it a try, thinking at least I won't have to share my room with 5 other persons and I'll have a private bathroom. First, excellent location, less than 5 minute walk from bus station. I loved Fremont St and the Downtown part. There, you don't have the problems of overcrowded sidewalks like on the Strip : a large portion of the street (called Fremont experience) is reserved to pedestrians. No problem at check-in, room with 2 double beds on the 7th floor. Large room, clean (except dirty windows). Shower doesn't work too well, should repair it. Woke up with backaches the 2 mornings because of the uncomfortable mattresses. Sheets were clean though. Free coffee in the room. Cable TV. Basic but convenient furnitures. Loved the pool at top of the hotel, pretty view up there, excellent for sunbathing and it wasn't crowded at all. I also liked the Casino, friendly cashier clerk. Coffee shop has very cheap breakfasts and other specials after 11pm. It was OK. You might want to try the 24/7 7.77$ buffet at the Plaza though : I loved it ! Also loved the 6.95$ excellent steak deal at the 4 Seasons. All in all, I'll probably give a shot at another Downtown hotel next time. But I had a good experience at Binion's though the place hasn't high standards. In fact I had more than I expected at this price. I'd have liked to give 2 and \u00be instead of 2. One last thing : get ready to exercise your patience if you plan to take the bus. A ride on the Deuce from Fremont St. to the Strip takes a good 45 min. (and it was week nights, can't imagine how it is during week-ends, must be terrible). So many people take it and it takes a loooong time for everyone to get aboard (sometimes almost 10 min just for 1 stop !). They should make it mandatory for users to buy a ticket prior to get aboard.

My first visit in Late April, right before the roof top pool opened. The rate was modest ($59) but the room was archaic and decrepit. On some level, this was a positive attribute as it gave me a taste of vintage \"old style\" Vegas. I didn't spend that much time in my hotel room anyway on that visit. My two biggest complaints: clogged tub drain and noisy A/C. However, that fourty year old hunker sure kicked out the ice cold AC. Also, I kind of liked the old wall paper and decor for nostalgic reasons. The gaming was fabulous with many loose slots, single deck blackjack, and a nice assortment of liberal video poker machines. And, I liked the low limit craps! BTW, the comps are fabulous and you can easily accumulate free rooms and dinners and other freebies. On my second trip in June I was given a \"mini suite\" on the 'Mint' side. This is where the newer rooms are located as well as the roof top pool and steakhouse. The difference in the rooms was night and day. I had a spacious room with several chairs and a table, a couch, huge closet space, climate control, and a modern bathroom that had its own little hallway. The carpet and bedding was clean and there was a fridge! BTW, this room was comped for 4 days from my previous visit. Also, they comped my previous hotel bill as well! I am not a massive higher roller either-just like playing dollar or quarter video poker and table games. BTW, I just got comped for 6 nights in early January during the biggest conference of the year. This time I'm going to try out the Balcony rooms on floor 21, 22, or 23. Anyways, I learned a valuable lesson from some other guests I later joined up with: don't be afraid to ASK FOR COMPS! The worst thing they'll say is 'no.' Futhermore, if you're a moderate to serious player you'll likely get some freebies. Also, I like that Binion's replaced the worn out carpet with identical new carpet stashed away years ago. And re-opening the snack room was a plus. Also, the poker room is really hopping again. Lets hope the new owners keep up the good work and invest resources into this classic property.

From what i read no renovations were done to the hotel during this closure and the casino which I have recenlty visited and certainly has had no updates. Anyhow my visit I must say was a very positive one with an exception. Upon checking in with a few friends we pulled in the front entrance and Valet the car, a nice $5 bill was presented to the valet attendant and we asked if he could keep it close. Now for the rest of our 4 day stay this guy remembered that tip and took care of us every time as we did him, The car was keeped right next to the valet booth like we were vips or something. On the strip your $5 would never get u that far. We checked in and the nicest guy at the front desk helped us and got us a room facing the freemont street experience allthough we were above it we got the two beds and was it a nice room not really and there was a piece of carpet cut out of the floor and replaced very obvious and a bit scary but my friends and I joked about what we imagined happended in that room. The windows did open and I liked that fresh air. Rooms were not dirty they were suitable for me to stay for 4 days but they were not great either u get what u pay for and nascar weekend is steep on room rates. Here was the problem. One night early evening I peeked out our peep hole (we were at the end of a hallway) to find a Drunk Homeless looking person passed out on the floor. I stayed in my room as he seemed harmless not causing any trouble. I called security and he was removed within 5 minutes so I was impressed with the fast response to the problem and would say they do have sufficent security as i have read other peoples concerns about it. Also our first night we came in very late and were well a bit intoxicated and could not remember our room number. The man once again was most helpful in getting us the right number. We didn't eat at the Steakhouse, but we did go up there and had a drink and the free bread they gave us. WHen we read the menus and the smallest steak was like $36 and u had to pay for a potato seperate for another 8 bucks or so I thought it was a little outta my reach $ wise. But if you have the cash I recommend the steak house the view is INCREDIBLE. While staying downtown we dined at Tony Romas at Freemont, not bad for the $. Also Golden Gate has a little deli in the back with the most incredible french dips, and 99 cent shrimp coctail t die for I have it everytime and my tummy is never upset. Also another place in golden gate is the Bay City Diner my hubby loves the NY steaks there. If you are going to eat at a coffee shop I highly reccomend the Golden Nuggets that looks over the pool area They have great food 24/7 and u can even get it to go like I did at 4 am and brought it back to my room at binions. I love the $2 t-shirts next to the Glitter Gultch. Glitter Gultch went there and it is the girls who are rejected at all the other nice vegas strip clubs that end up here. 2 drink minimum to get in and a beer is like $9 but you can drink your beers toss a couple of $1 bills at the dancer at he stage and split, Do not waste your $on a lap dance.

It seemed to have a lack of security.and dirty.To sum it all up, I won't be staying there any time soon. I'm certainly glad I got staying at the \"Horseshoe\" out of my system. So much for history. I've decided I like \"modern\"a whole lot better. P.S. We have been to Vegas many times and this was without a doubt the most disappointing stay!", "Date": "August 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tacoma, WA", "Title": "\u201cBinion's was super\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5028962", "Content": "Read the reviews, hubby's coworkers even asked your staying there?

The hotel is not great, but it's not bad. The whole place is a bit dark but we didn't notice any of the smells I have read about on here. The noise from Fremont Street was a bit of an issue but as soon as the music stopped at midnight ish it was fine. Fremont Street overall was OK, but the light show is nothing special, I can't believe people were videotaping it! I would recommend visitors to stay on the Strip rather than here, not that it's particularly bad but the Strip has so much more to offer. On a more positive note, the bus station is within walking distance and the pool area was totally dead but quite pleasant - it was 35 degrees celcius and me and my friend were the only ones up there all afternoon! The digital thermometer and clock on the roof were also nice.", "Date": "June 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bastrop, TX", "Title": "\u201cTime To Shoot The Horse\u201d", "Author": "bpm65", "ReviewID": "UR3605134", "Content": "Me and my wife stayed 2 nights june 10th and 11th, at the horseshoe and were ready to leave after day 1. The rack rate was inexpensive, as should be for a run down, smelly hotel. And as much as I like The Fremont Street Experience, it grows weary to have it pound into your room on the half hour until 12:30am when you don\u2019t want to experience it. The room that we stayed in was a non-smoking room, but with decades of nicotine having wafted through the room, old cigarette burns and all, prior to it being classified a non-smoking room, if they left the window open to air out the room for ten years it would still stink. The pool was unique, and that it is located on the top floor and lounging area is surrounded by heavy glass partitions, so it offers nice views but, the pool capacity is oh about 10 people. And wear shoes when walking around the deck because their are very small slivers of glass here and there, believe me I know. If you are a smoker and a heavy gambler, you might not want to ever leave it. If you are not then avoid, unless you are just looking for a relatively cheap room. And you can get that at the Plaza which offers better accommodations with the same smell.", "Date": "June 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reston, VA", "Title": "\u201cDon't Waste your Money!!\u201d", "Author": "M3Princess", "ReviewID": "UR3583347", "Content": "The staff at Binion's were absolutely obnoxious, rude and highly unprofessional.
