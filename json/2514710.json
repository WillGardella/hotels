I have traveled and stayed in many hotels in New York, the US, and overseas and NEVER have I received such bad communication, such irresponsible people.

The hotel is excellent located. The Empire State Bld is in the close neighbourhood and you can easily walk to Times Square, Union Station, Penn Station etc. When we checked in they would give us a room with one king bed, with the explanation that that was according to our reservation. The personnell at the desk were at first not willing to accept that we had ordered a room with two beds, even if we showed them the voucher stating it clearly. They offered to make up the sofa-bed in the room and try to move us to another room the day after, if available. We were not willing to accept that, and after checking the booking system once again, a room with two beds was available after all! The room was on the 5th floor facing the back-yard, and surprisingly quiet to be situated in the middle of NYC. The room was spacious with two flat-screen TVs and the bathroom was ok, but both were in need of a refurbishment. Dark wallpaper and brown curtains made it very dark and the lightning was not sufficient. Our reservation was for a deluxe suite. I am sure our room was not in that category, but we did not bother to further argumentation. Plus for wooden floor in the room and for an extra fridge, since the mini-bar was was of the automatic type, in which you cannot move anything withoug being charged for it. Comfortable beds, a spacious wardrobe and a safe were also a plus. All-in-all we enjoyed staying at this hotel and will definitely consider to stay there again later.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "scotland", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel, excellent location.\u201d", "Author": "bigcraigScotland", "ReviewID": "UR126557301", "Content": "Dont quite understand a recent reviewer saying that the location of this hotel was not good?? About 60 yards east of 5th Avenue and about a 4 minute walk to Empire State building? Anyway.......stayed here in February 2012 for a 4 night break with my wife. My first time in New York and I loved every second of it! Hotel was difficult to see when we were dropped off, but they now have a canopy fitted outside, so should be much easier to find. The hotel is really nice inside.......we asked for a high floor and we got this. Our room (1209) was a junior suite overlooking the rear of the hotel......not much to see on the streets below but a nice view at night through the gaps of the buildings opposite. Room had 2 double beds, which we would have normally pushed together to create a super king size, but a pole in the middle of the beds prevented this. Room had 2 flatscreen TV's on the wall and the room was huge (17 paces from room door to far window). Bathroom was a good size and shower and bath worked perfectly. There was a mini bar (very expensive) in the room and also a small fridge, which didnt get very cool, but did the job. The down side of the hotel was that there was no communal bar area downstairs. Apparently it is under new management (and changed names from 'Vincci Avalon' to 'Avalon') so that might be the reason why. Interior decor of the hotel is very nice, especially on the higher floors - rooms are clean and spacious. All staff, especially door staff, (Wilson in particular) are very friendly and helpful. Free computers to use in a private area, near reception, is a nice touch. In summary we really liked this hotel. IF they can keep the prices to what we paid this time, then there is no doubt that we would stay here again.

Many boutique hotels in NYC (as well as regular hotels) are quite old and really only a rare few will possess that old-world tacky charm that just makes you feel like you're a piece of the history. The Avalon truly delivers on this cultural aspect. Many hotels in NYC are on the borderline of being dated and broken down so choosing one can be a daunting task. The Avalon has some of the largest rooms in all of NYC (mine was 475 square feet with a separate office) It was again a bit \"old world\" but it has that special charm, was very clean and comfortable and is by far the best value I have ever found in all of NYC. If you want a 5 star gem hotel at $500 a night or more then the Avalon is not for you but if you want a very spacious room and an old world feeling at around $200, then do not look elsewhere. The area is unique as well with little Korea just a block away. You can get to midtown or the village (downtown) in a short 5 to 10 minute cab ride.

Shower was a little weak but we both have short hair so not too much of a problem. Sleep quality: The beds were soooo good we nearly spent more time in bed than walking in the city! However, AC issues affected sleep quality. Value: The buffet breakfast seems a little overpriced especially when you will never have more than one round. The hotel advertises a private car service to the airport for $70 not including toll ($6.50) and 20% gratuity guide (which you may as well add anyway! $14). This means that a ride to the airport works out at $90.50! If you ring Carmel Cars --- the flat rate is $48 before toll and 20% gratuity. They have been about since 1978 and are reliable.

An excellent starting point to our discovery vacation. The room was quiet and the air conditioning worked well. The large bathroom was perfect for three women.

The furniture in the room and in the common areas was shabby. The drapes in the room were very worn, close to being tattered.

We had to call every day for additional bath towels, hand towels and face cloths. There were not enough hangers for a group of people. Thank goodness we had brought our own.

Two big flat-screens and free wi-fi, always a plus. And of course the location is fine. But things were just a little funky/off. On closer inspection, the clear grout/caulk in the bathroom was layered over black mildew. A couple of the lamps weren't working, and the guide to the TV didn't sync up with the actual TV channels. The thing that really creeped me out, though, was the laminate flooring in my room. No rugs, no carpet--just sad, saggy Pergo-type material.

I can't begin to rave enough about the hotel; the service was warm and inviting (the front desk staff were fairly attractive too). As we walked in we were immediately greeted by the bag/coat check and the front desk staff. I requested prior to our visit 'the best room they had',. I had originally booked the double queen suite, and they then offered to upgrade me free to a penthouse king bed suite. The suite was incredible! The bathroom was half the size of the 550sq ft room, but I unfortunately had another traveler that prohibited me from taking it. So we went to our originally assigned room (#307) and were still wowed. The place was extremely clen and the bathroom was a nice touch (marble everywhere). A few things I notedd that didn't hinder our stay to much: 1. The sheets were amazing but the comforter was not warm/thick at all, seemed to be more of a shall type of deal 2. The bathroom shower was clear glass, which sucked when three guys were trying to get ready (we really weren't keen on seeing each-others junk). Also I don't think there was a shower head (or if there was it spurted out and looked like the end of just the pipe). There was still hot water abundant. 3. The wall mounted LCD were awesome, but there were a cluster of cables running beneath it on the floor. 4. No room service and the wifi is VERY weak We didn't cehck out the Spa that was included with our stay, so no comments there. The location was perfect; just far enough from the touristy sections but not far enough to be in the middle of no where. Lots of EXCELLENT restaurants nearby, and if yo uwant a late night munchy, Papaya Dog is 100ft from the front door. Overall, our stay was great.

We complained and they moved us the next day which was great, and when i phoned down to complain about the guests who were partying, the security and receptionist were very prompt in dealing with my complaint effectively, they went straight up and addressed the situation and all the partying stopped. Location is excellent however it is too noisy at nights as the traffic is crazy, i would not stay again because of the noise and also because i didnt feel that the customer service was good.

Rates in NYC are rock bottom right now and we had a wide variety of choices in the 4-star category for less than $130/night. We come to the city often and have been to many, many different hotels. The Vincci's location is wonderful. The 15-minute walk from Grand Central where we come into the city was quite nice. Check-in was quick and we had booked a Jr. Suite with a queen bed and they upgraded us without our asking to a King Suite which is an elongated room with a King bed and a couch area. The marble bathroom had a tub and a shower stall as well as double sinks and it was very spacious. I can't really speak to the service since we didn't need it, but the front desk woman who checked us in was friendly, as was the man who delivered ice to our room. Before I say anything else, I will preface it with the fact that we would definitely stay here again if the price was right. My complaints are not deal breakers, just not what I expect out of a hotel of this caliber. And certainly not what I would expect had I paid normal NYC prices. The reason why I am only giving 4-stars instead of 5 is because of the appointments and lack of attention paid to details in the room. Other 4-star hotels we've been to (Intercontinental being our most recent) have invested much more in room decor. The furniture here was cheap to begin with, so of course, it was broken. The armoire was falling apart on the bottom and the drawers inside were broken. The wood on all pieces of furniture was badly dinged and chipped. And there was a long, cloth covered bench that had been \"spot cleaned\" so many times that it was covered with clean spots and actually looked disgusting. My last \"complaint\" would be the Internet service. Yes it is free, but boy is it SLOW!!!! It was as if I was using dial-up. Other hotels I have stayed in in the city have not been much better, but I still want to mention it. If you were trying to conduct business via the computer, you would be frustrated. On a positive note, I believe this may have been the first hotel I've stayed in where the floor in the room was not carpeted. It was a good change of pace to have the Pergo flooring. I was worried at first we might here other guests' heels clicking above us, but we did not.

My fianc\u00e9 and I were travelling from Spain to spend a few weeks in the USA. We would spend the first 3 nights in NYC, then fly down to Florida before returning to NYC to spend a further 4 nights, then fly back to Europe. I was perhaps a little sceptical about staying here as some of the other members reviews were both positive and negative. After some careful consideration, we decided to book the hotel for the first 3 nights of our stay, and if the hotel was good, we would book the last 4 nights of our holiday there too. Let me tell you, the hotel was just fine for our needs, and we did in fact book (via their website) the last 4 nights there. This was our first visit to NYC so we wanted to be in a central location. You cannot get more central than this!. The Empire State Building is just around the corner, and as other reviewers have mentioned, Macy\u00b4s and Maddison SQ Garden are all a short walk away. The hotel is not a modern hotel, but it is clean and comfortable. The d\u00e9cor I guess could be called \u201ccharming\u201d. Check-in was easy and the friendly receptionist, Mawy, advised us that we had been upgraded from a King Deluxe to an Executive King Suite. The room was very spacious, large bedroom and sectioned off sitting area with sofa, chairs and desk, the marble bathroom had all the amenities that you would expect from a 4 Star hotel, as well a Jacuzzi bath and separate shower. We had two LCD Flatscreen TV\u00b4s and an iPod docking station as well as a Bose radio in the room. The furniture seemed new and was very comfortable. There is also an electronic Safe Box as well as an Ironing Board and Iron, which I think comes in useful in hotels as they tend to charge a lot of money for pressing your clothes. When I had made the room reservation on their website, I had ordered a Half bottle of House Champagne and some Madisson Crunch Chocolates to be delivered to the room, these were not there when we arrived, so I had to call down to the front desk for them. Mawy arranged for the items to be delivered promptly afterwards. The \u201cChampagne\u201d in fact turned out to be Spanish Cava and the Chocolates were a selection of Ferrero Roche. Not exactly as described on their website, and we all know the price difference between a bottle of Champagne and Cava. Later that evening I asked the Doorman/Luggage Porter where I could try a good steak, and he recommended a restaurant three blocks away, which turned out to be very good. We never tried the breakfast at the hotel, but overheard that it was 16USD per person. Instead we ventured out to the Bagel Caf\u00e9 on the corner every morning (which is open 24 hours). An Open Top Bus Tour is a must, and one of the stops is just outside the Empire State Building, which in turn is just around the corner. Having spent the days sightseeing and shopping, we felt that it was always nice to return to the hotel. The staff were very pleasant and welcoming, and as many reviewers have stated, the beds are heavenly comfortable. There is free WiFi access in the lobby as well as 2 PC\u00b4s for guest use, which comes in handy if you want to check emails or your flight bookings. The rooms were cleaned very well on a daily basis. Ours was facing the street, so there was some noise during the night (it seems mandatory in NYC to honk your car horn every so often), but it wasn\u2019t loud as I thought it would be. There is an Aircon/Heating machine in the rooms, and the quite hum kind of drowns out the noise from outside. There were two remote controls for each television, which we found a bit confusing, but they both worked and the channels were clear (CNN, BBC World etc\u2026). The Minibar was well stocked and the normal prices for a hotel, though there were no wine glasses available, even though 2 half bottles of wine were. There is a filter coffee machine also. The hotel was quite busy during our stay, and there are a lot of international clientele, especially Spanish (the hotel belongs to a Spanish chain). Overall, we enjoyed our stay, and wondered why the hotel had got some negative reviews. About two weeks later we returned to the hotel. The Doorman remembered us and gave us a very warm \u201cwelcome back\u201d. This time there was no upgrade, so we got the King Delux that we originally booked. This time our room was on the backside of the hotel and the view was basically of the building next door or the fire escape, meaning that we had to keep our curtains closed for most of the time. The room was a little bit smaller than our previous one, with no partition between the small living area. There were 2 TV\u00b4s, though these were quite old and small, and not the Flatscreens that we had before. The sound didn\u2019t work properly on one of them, instead we got a loud hissing noise from the speakers. There was no Bose radio either, and the floor creaked. I went down to the Front Desk to see if I could change room, the Receptionist didn\u2019t even look up from her computer screen and bluntly told me that the hotel was full, and that maybe we could change the following day. We decided to grin and bear it, seeing as we would be out most of the time, and didn\u2019t want to be fussed with unpacking and packing up again for changing rooms, as long as the TV was fixed, we could handle it. Again without looking up from her computer, she wrote down problem with the TV and said it would be fixed. Back in the room, some of the furniture was a bit old, and some of the lamps could have done with changing, the one near the bed was almost falling off. The shower head was broken, which meant that we had to use the shower in the bath tub (no Jacuzzi this time), which in turn made the whole floor wet and slippery. Our room was situated next to the Service Store, the small room were the Maids keep the towels, slippers, shampoos, cleaning liquids etc\u2026 This meant that during the night, you could hear the night cleaner talking and opening and shutting the door, and during the early morning you could hear the Maids do the same. Now I began to understand some of the negative reviews from this site. When returning from dinner, the TV had still not been fixed. So we ended up watching the TV on mute and use the sound from the other set instead. Kind of semi Stereo!. The next morning, Mawy the receptionist was on duty, so I told her about the TV and she promised to have someone look at it. Later that day, in keeping with her promise, the TV was fixed. As always, during our stay our room was expertly cleaned. Our departing flight was in the evening, so the next day I went to enquire about the possibility of a late check-out. The receptionist, the one who refuses to acknowledge the clients, never looked up from her screen as she said that I had to speak to a Manager. I think that when you pay the amount you do to stay in a 4 Star hotel, the staff should at least acknowledge you and make eye contact. I wasn\u2019t checking out until the next day, so I said that I would speak to a manager tomorrow. I sarcastically thanked her for her \u201chelp\u201d, and she managed to answer me, again without even looking up. The following morning I went to the Front Desk. I said my \u201cGood Mornings\u201d and asked her if I could speak to a Manager. Again, without looking up she called out for one of the Managers. It was the Assistant Front Office Manager, Eric on duty and I explained to him that I would appreciate, if possible, a late check-out. He checked on the system and found that my room was already booked for another guest, but he could let me check-out at 13.30hrs and that they could store my luggage if need be, which we agreed to and thanked him for his help. A little later I got a call from the front desk at around 11.00hrs, to remind me that check-out time was coming up, so I reminded her that only 15 minutes before, Eric had agreed to a late check-out. Without apologising she put the phone down. I know that hotels have a huge amount of guests daily, and it is hard for staff to remember them, but if you are staying for 4 nights, I think that it would be easier to recognise you and not treat you like \u201cjust another room number\u201d. I cannot stand \u201cimpersonal service\u201d, or worse still, rudeness. I felt a little disappointed with this stay, the first stay was great, great service, great room. However, the second stay we felt was a big let down and an anti climax to a pleasant holiday. We could tolerate the difference in room if the customer service had made up for it. There is nothing better than \"Service with a Smile\". If the experience had been similar to my first stay, I would give the Avalon Vincci an \"Excellent\" rating, however, I have given it a \"Neutral/ Average\" based mainly on my return. On the whole, I would only recommend this hotel if you book the Executive Suites, they only cost a little more, and the difference is huge. The locale is great and near to everything and 99% of the staff are very helpful.

I specified the size and ages of my party and was quoted a price of approx 1600 dollars which I thought was ok considering the central location of the Hotel. I was aware of some negative comments on sites such as this but felt overall the comments were positive. A week before my intended travel date I received a confirmation letter from the hotel noting that I had booked a Junior suite at the price which I was originally quoted. This raised my suspicions so I had a further look at the hotel website and noticed that a charge of 50 dollars plus tax per night per additional adult over the age of 11 was mentioned.(additional being over 2 persons occupying a suite with 2 queen beds and a sofa bed). As a result of the hotels failure to respond to numerous emails I rang the hotel who very abruptly told me that this had always been their practice but admitted that it wasnt specified on their website at the time I made my booking but that I would have to pay an additional amount of approx 600 dollars. I then queried the change in room and was bothered off with more abrupt remarks that the two types of rooms were comparable (when a glance at the hotels website would show you otherwise). 4 days before my intended arrival I found another hotel and emailed the avalon to cancel my reservation. Having got no reply to my email, the following day I rang the hotel spoke with a lady in the reservations section again cancelled the stay and confirmed my phone call by email. On arriving home i noted that I had been charged 305 dollars by the Avalon which is their charge where a cancellation is not recieved 48 hours before the day of arrival.

Well if two Queen size beds in very close proximity and around 10 foot square living space is a Junior suite then you'll be happy. Total room dimensions around 25x10 feet and gloomy with it. View dismal out back - see picture. Anyway room changed quick enough but when we by chance collared resident cleaner he asked that reception check with him before allocating next room so as to ensure that they had made it up....who is running this place I wonder? Further problems ensued, turn one of two TVs on and the sound comes out at full blast, the other TV has only half a picture - noisy TV once volume turned down then turns itself off after 1/2 hour for no apparent reason. Turn it on again and you are back at full volume! Reported problems to reception who promised something would be done. Nothing happened. The air con seemed jammed on boiling, registering 85 deg F when returned in evenings, fortunately window part opens to let cool night air in - it was in the low 20's deg F! As above reported to reception to no avail. Night safe didn't open and, as above, reported but no follow up. Otherwise the place is clean and as my better half described it as 'Georgian distressed elegance' - I think this is very apt. Four stars for this - you have to be kidding me! Hotel Bar - yep this only appears to open weekends. Breakfasts are good if pricey. So thats the bad side, is there any good I hear you ask? Well location is excellent, 2 minutes from the Empire State Building, 5 mins from Macy's. Close to subway (buy Metrocard for $7 and travel as much as you like in 24 hours - kids under 12 go free - available in subways at ATM style kiosks everywhere). Thats the good bit. I have no axe to grind against this place and it should be much better. I really wanted it to be good but perhaps I was just unlucky. It looks the business on the website but it is tired. I have no yardstick to benchmark other mid town Manhattan hotels but an NY acquaintance of mine described the area as much improved upon from early 90's when it was distinctly dodgy - touch of the Korean district to it.

I informed the hotel that I would need to cancel my reservation completely and find alternative accomodation.

After 1 week I had not received any such confirmation so contacted the hotel again to check the cancellation had been actioned. I was told I would receive an email and waited. I decided to send an email so that I would have proof of my request in writing. This email was sent several times over the period of a few weeks asking for a response to acknowledge my requests. I never received one! My fantastic trip to NYC has now been and gone and upon returning had the lovely surprise of a $270 charge on my credit card for a no show! Despite contacting the hotel to request my refund, hotel staff are rude, abrupt have have no intentions of processing my refund and have even hung up on me!!

I booked on Hotwire for approx. $212.50/nt. The room was on the 5th floor and when we exited the elevator, we noticed that the carpet was a little worn. Entering our room we noticed the wood floor creaked as we walked across it. (We were concerned that this might bother other tenants, but no one ever complained.) Our room consisted of 2 queen size beds in one room and a sleeper sofa in a separate sitting area. We feel the rooms were very large for us, as was the bathroom which consisted of a counter with double sinks, toilet, standing glass shower and a separate bath tub. There were always plenty of towels as well. The only complaint we had was the location of the shower head in the shower. Our heights range from 4'-10\" to 5'-1\". However the shower head was at least 7' high. We could not adjust it so we had to call maintenance to come adjust it for us. Maintenance came very quickly, but he could not adjust it to point any lower than it already was. So he ended up pointing it toward the back wall a little so we had a little more room. Since we were on the 5th floor, we did experience some traffic noise in the early mornings, but a trip to the local Duane Reade Drug store for ear plugs rectified that problem. Subways were very close and we took them everywhere. (If you are staying 3 days or longer, I suggest that you purchase the unlimited subway passes.) We also walked alot. The hotel is about 2 blocks from the Empire State Building on 32nd Street between Madison and 5th Avenue and we felt very safe walking around at night. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the Avalon hotel. Staff was very nice, congenial and quite knowledgeable about transportation to any part of the city.

We had two reservations booked through Expedia, our first night was a one bedroom room for the two of us, then moving to a larger room with two double beds when our party grew to 4 on the last two nights. Checking in at 1:30a.m. was no problem as our plane was delayed, we called ahead to let them know. Our room was spacious including a separate sitting area, great bathroom, large as well for NYC. Our shower handle was loose, but operational. Great waterpressure-you can adjust it at the spa style showerhead - and thermostatic valves with plenty of hot water. Comfy beds with a semi-boutique room aesthetic. For ice you have to call down for it to be delivered, but this actually became a small luxury and was quick. We were allowed to move to our larger room , even on the same floor, once we checked out of the smaller room. We had thought we might have to check our luggage until 3:00 check in. Helpful staff avoided this. Our larger room-double jr. suite -had two tvs and a shower with a garden tub and two sinks- pleasant surprise. It was on a back alley view, so quiet but nothing to see but the top of an historic copper rooftop. Heating system worked great, a little louder than perfect. Quiet rooms, no sounds from the other guests. For NYC it is a great home away from home, a few more luxuries than the standard, and other than a loose shower handle all was tip top. We didn't dine in the hotel, just snacks out of the mini bar. I recommend Daniels bagels for true NYC breakfast-3 blocks away, there are quite a few Zagat rated Asian restaurants on 32nd. We ate twice at the Korean take out /market a block away. For a view have drinks at the Mandarin Hotel, with a great view of Central Park, and enjoy your savings staying at the Avalon.

Highly recommend starbucks just across the road for a nice coffee and breakfast sandwich, a good way to start a day full of shopping!! Yellow cabs are really cheap and they are everywhere so you don't have to hang around just hail one when they pass. We booked the shuttle bus to and from JFK airport but nobody told us that you have to go to a desk in the airport once you have landed and show them your vouchers and THEY ring the bus for you. We spent an hour waiting outside the airport trying to flag one down only to be told we had to go to the desk and one came rightaway. Times square is much better by night than it is in the day. Planet Hollywood is also in times square and is very, very good and not expensive as you would expect. You might have to que for 15-20 mins but it is definitely worth it. The four of us got a meal each and a giant cocktail each (with a planet hollwood glass to keep) and the whole lot came to \u00a360.

Check in was quick and efficient after our long (delayed) flight, staff went out of their way to ensure we didn't have any further waiting on this already stressful day! We were upraded for the 1st night from a deluxe to executive suite (probably due to overbooking!) but were able to keep this for the duration of our stay for no extra charge which was great. The suite was large, clean and tidy and was kept immaculately clean by the cleaning staff each day. We had a king size bed in the bedroom area, along with a double sofa bed in the lounge. The bathroom was large with a shower and jacuzzi bath and there was a useful 'dressng area' between the bathroom and bedroom parts which was good as it gives a little privacy and space to get changed should it be needed. Location as has been said before is excellent - within easy walking of most attractions. We even walked to Central Park along 5th (about 1/2 hour or so stroll). We walked almost everywhere and felt really safe at all times. I have to say that we found everyone extremely friendly with the exception of the bar/restaurant staff who seemed to have a 'don't care attitude'. We ate in the bar/restaurant on the first night and the service was OK (food was pretty good though), however, on eating there later in our stay, the service was awful. The waitress took our order and brought the wrong food due to her being more interested in talking on her cell phone and watching TV than taking the order correctly. We told her that she had brought the wrong food, and she grudgingly corrected it. The final straw was when we asked for the bill and she had added a $20 tip to it! When we questioned this, she said that the manager told her she was allowed to do this for all orders and no-one had ever complained before! We always tip for good service but take offense at being told we HAVE to tip and how much we should leave! She then tried to tell us that this is how it is in America, but, at no other time during our visit was a mandatory service charge added without it being stated on the menu at the outset. I guess this is just someone trying it on but it didn't work with us and for the first time ever, we left no tip at all! This said, all in all we would stay at this hotel again as you don't really eat in the restaurant very much as there is so much choice within easy walking distance and the location and rooms made up for the problems with the restaurant. One tip I would add is that we booked with Super Shuttle for our airport transfers and this was a complete disaster, having to wait almost 2 hours at Newark airport to go to the hotel. This was not the hotel's fault, but I thought I'd mention it for anyone planning to use this service.

In terms of location, the Avalon is ideally placed being just a few minutes walk from Macey's, Empire State Building, Madisson Sq Garden and the Flatiron building and makes for a great tourist quality hotel stay. I'm not sure if I would rate it as a four star hotel but its definately a good quality three star hotel.

The staff was friendly, but the management of this hotel needs serious upgrading. We booked a junior suite at $300 a night and were placed in a very tiny \"superior\" room. After we got into the room, I had to go visit the desk assistant and remind him that we didn't get the room we paid for. He said that no junior suites were available at our time of booking (although we had a printed confirmation for one), so you have to be careful that the room you book is actually the room you get. We did get a $25 credit the next morning. There are a number of other issues. The desk staff is also instructed to answer the telephone, so callers get first priority while the real live guests get to wait in line. No one on the desk staff instructed us that we could get a $30 discount at our parking garage by having the hotel validate our ticket. We would have overpaid if the garage attendant hadn't mentioned it. That meant my wife had to walk all the way back to the hotel to get the ticket stamped. As mentioned above, the superior rooms are very tiny. The beds were made up for the summer although we arrived in December, so we had only a thin blanket and light spread. There was no comforter in the closet and no additional pillows (other than the one each that we had), except for a long, bolster-type piece that neither of us could use individually. There were two of us in the room, but only one robe. The bars of soap are kind of thin. When I turned up the heat in the middle of the night, we discovered that the thermostat activated a loud overhead blower that actually moved the curtains on the other side of the room. To keep the room warm, we had to listen to this blower go on and off during the night. The mattresses are of the old, cheap variety. Beds have not been upgraded to the premium grade that you can find in so many other hotels these days. We also heard a number of doors slam early on Sunday morning. As a result of these issues, we got a poor night's sleep. This hotel is conveniently located and prices are fair.

The staff were efficient and friendly and on the one occassion that i needed help with the thermostat an engineer came immediately. The breakfast is not worth bothering to rush down for, but there's a great deli on the corner that serves bacon, eggs, french toast, fresh fruit etc, so why worry about being down before 7.00 am for tea and pastries in the hotel. But its the location that wins over other hotels, its just around the corner from the ESB, and a 2 min walk from Macy's, what more could you want.

I am a pretty patient person and realize that things happen beyond one's control, but this hotel and manager were the worst. We checked in on Wednesday, November 29, 2006 and were to check out on Saturday, December 2, 2006, however, after a horrible experience, we left on Friday. The first thing that was somewhat aggravating was that there was only one person on duty at all times so there was always a line at the desk. No one could check in before 3pm at all and there was a HUGE line and lots of people crammed into this tiny little lobby. There was no hot water on Thursday or Friday and there was no compensation or even an apology from the manager. He was very obnoxious about the whole situation like it was our fault. It was also 78 degrees in our room and we were told to open the windows that the heat had been turned on for the fall and they couldn't provide any air condition even though it was an unseasonably warm 68 degrees outside. When our agent contacted the hotel for details the manager told them that the water was only off for a couple of hours and it wasn't as big a deal as we had stated AND that we had lied about the number of individuals in our party. He said that we stated 2 guests and really had 4 in the room. Well, we did book 2, but someone else decided to join us and we told the hotel that when we checked in and that there would be 3 (not 4) and gave all of our party's names. We were charged an extra $25 per night for the extra person which was shown as a charge on our bill proving that we had given them the information. At first glance the hotel fairly nice, but it is MUCH smaller than the website visualizes. It is a cute little place, but very worn. There were big strips ripped off of the window sill/seat, a couple of the outlets were broken in half, the furniture was all knicked up and the shelf in the tv armoir was broken and fell out in the floor when we opened the doors, the lock was missing from the bathroom door handle, the hot water handle in the tub fell off and one of the pieces attached to that handle fell off as well, the handle to pull out to turn the shower on came off in my hand when I pulled it out to turn the shower on, the faucet leaked all over the sink and got our things wet, when the maid came all she did was make our bed and empty the trash, there were no clean towels left and the sink and bath tub weren't cleaned (we were able to shower Wednesday night), when we called for towels were were told that they would bring some right up, well they never did...but since we couldn't shower I guess they figured it was no big deal. Due to the heat we kept the windows open the entire time and the horrible smell of the food from a nearby restaurant was stomach turning. Also, the guy on the scaffold with the jack hammer or drill right outside our window first thing in the morning was really nice too. The room was very dimly lit and just added to the darkness of our visit. We left and went to another hotel that we had stayed in last year and finished up our trip on a bright and wonderful note! We only booked with the Avalon because the other great hotel was triple what we had paid the year before and it wasn't possible. I know that anyone that stayed during the time that we were there will never go back again. We had conversations with several different groups there and no one was happy with the hotel or staff and left. I do have to say that the bellman and the one girl at the desk when we checked in were wonderful. They were kind and helpful and did what they could for everyone. The poor desk clerk that checked us in was doing it all by herself and kept a smile on her face the whole time. I felt bad for her that she was put in the position to handle all of the conflict for the manager who was rarely available.

We arrived at 2.30pm and although on booking had been told check in was 3pm, thought that the room may be ready. Was told by a very abrupt receptionist that we could not check in until 3pm.

To be honest the best service we received from any of the staff was the bell man where he seemed to be rushing around all over the hotel. Throughout our stay the staff on the front desk were a little unfriendly and we had to call twice to get our luggage delivered.

The Avalon fit the bill. When we arrived we also saw the giant blowup rat by the front door - but, it was only there one day and didn't bother us at all. My boyfriend and I were in a \"Superior Double Room\", which was incredibly small, but fit us just fine. The bathroom was fairly clean, although our bathtub was obviously plugged up as after we took our first shower, within minutes, we would be standing in a few inches of water. Yuck. Also, they do not have fitted sheets on the beds, only a top sheet that is somehow tucked underneath - needless to say within an hour of sleeping the sheet found it's way up and we would wake up with our bodies touching the bare mattress. Yuck, again. We also had a mini-bar in the room, but the fridge was absolutely NOT working, so anything in there was not cold, but rather lukewarm. My parents stayed in a king suite, which was MUCH nicer than our room, and they didn't have as many complaints. The room is very large with a huge bathroom (a toilet and a bidet), a jacuzzi bathtub, a standup shower, and a large vanity with two sinks. They also had a separate sitting room, with a pull-out couch and another TV. My major complaints about the hotel would be their service - on Saturday morning we ordered room service for breakfast, and it was a disaster. My mother called in first and the person receiving the phone call didn't speak a word of English, so after 10 minutes of trying to tell him what they wanted to order, she hung up. My sister tried calling a few minutes later and although she got through to someone else, it took forever to get to their room and when it arrived, the order was almost completely incorrect - they had asked for potatoes with their eggs, and instead all received sausage; the toast was literally a piece of bread, not even remotely toasted; they asked for orange juice and received milk; the list goes on and on. There was no continental breakfast that I saw, and even if it was there, I doubt it would be any good. The location is very nice - we walked pretty much everywhere, and we were in a safe area.

As most of the previous reviews mentioned, it was superbly located in mid-town, about two blocks from the Empire State Bldng, and two blocks from the subway. The hotel was clean, and relatively spacious, by NY standards. We had requested a Deluxe Queen, which would have given us two Queen beds, apparently tough to find in NY. Most hotels have doubles. Anway, even though we confirmed three times, they did not have that room when we arrived. They gave us a King Suite instead (King bed and foldout couch) and said we could have the other room the rest of the days. We ended up not switching, and just staying in the King Suite, as it was fairly roomy and our 13-year old son didn't mind the fold out. HIghlights: two tvs, good air conditioning, clean, spacious, nice bathroom that was well appointed and had a separate shower and bath with good water pressure. Very close to good food that's reasonable. We didn't book online, so our stay didn't include the buffet breakfast, which I though was pricey as a separate charge. Demerits--air conditioning is controlled by the central desk and you have to call every single time you want it turned up or down. Also, there are no ice machines, so you have to call the front desk and ask for a bellman to bring ice to you... a pain when it's 95 and humid like it was when we were there. It sometimes took as long as an hour to get ice after a request. They offer \"continental breakfast\" in the lobby from 7 to 10, but we only managed to get there before everything was gone one day out of our week's stay. We usually went down around 9, an hour before it should be done, and it was completely gone.

We elected to get the shuttle transfer from La Guardia to the Hotel for $17 per person. We discovered upon arrival that the fare, if you book with Super Shuttle directly, is only $14 ea.(I believe), but MAKE A RESERVATION! We opted to call ahead of the crowd waiting for luggage and we got on a van in the last 2 seats... Super Shuttle was short many drivers that day, so who knows how long we would have waited. We arrived early at the hotel. Our room was not ready yet, we asked to stow our luggage so we could take a walk. The receptionist was very nice but placid. She called the 'bell hop' on the radio. After waiting 15 minutes, patiently watching him (the bell hop) run around fetching others' luggage, I made eye contact and got him to finally aknowledge us and take our bags. We walked around the neighborhood for an hour and a half, noting our surroundings and came back to check in at 4:00 p.m. We stayed in room #1009, a Junior Suite on the 10th floor and our first impression was quite positive. The room was quite comfortable in size for 2 people; 2 double beds, very large bathroom with marble and seemed very clean (we later found a pair of shoes under one of the beds). The room also provided a small refrigerator, an iron and ironing board, plenty of hangers and a safe which we found usefull. The other reviewers did state truthfully; stained upholstery on the furnishings (also a bit worn), cheesy fake wood flooring (I noted as padded), and service was spotty. We had breakfast vouchers for 2 days. 'Hot Breakfast' was supposed to be an added $5 each, but we were never charged extra. I was happy with the food quality; the fruit was fresh, eggs tasted real, all-in-all it was decent. They did seem under-staffed though, only one 'busser' who was running around very efficiently, the host friendly yet timid. One thing to note was that upon arrival in our room on that Sunday afternoon, we didn't have any towels in our bathroom. We called the front desk to have housekeeping bring us towels, to which they said 'right away', turned out to be an hour later after a second call. When the towels did finally come, they were warm, obviously fresh from the dryer, but frayed. I wondered if the hotel could be low on their linen supply? Also noted was that when house keeping tidied our room on our Monday stay, they took our wash cloths and never brought new ones, not even the next day. We just used the hand towels, which there seemed to always be plenty of. Towels wouldn't normally be an issue for me, but after travelling all day, we needed to freshen up before dinner. One thing that really bothered me was that when we arrived back to our room Tuesday afternoon, housekeeping had cleaned our 'wood' floor with some sort of cleaner-polish. The smell hit you like a ton of bricks once you entered the room, so we opened the window to air things out, but the smell never really went away. Also, when we went to iron clothes, the iron wouldn't really hold the water needed for steam; it kind of leaked out as you ironed. The iron surface seemed to stick to your clothes as you ironed also... When we returned from a long day of dining and site seeing, we asked the bell hop if there was a wine shop locally, he said for me to check with the 'concierge'. When I asked the same question to the gentelman at the front desk, he said to ask the bell hop. We just went upstairs and searched the yellow pages, and found several stores within walking distance. Also, CVS (convenience store) right on the corner of 5th and 32nd. The elevaters are a tad slow, but we never had any problems. The famous \"Rat\" was out front of the hotel on the week days, it goes up in the morning, and they take it down in the early evening. The Union folks never seemed to bother the guests though. It seemed to be quite a harmless situation. Oh yeah! Not related to the hotel, but worth mentioning; We did the observation deck tour at The Empire State building. We paid $16 each, waited in line for 2 hours to get up there, then spent 20 minutes observing and taking pictures. They try to get you to rent a hand-held device that \"explains what you are seeing\". Very obnoxious sales pitch to me. The wait for the trip down in the elevater was 30 minutes also. We wouldn't have done it if we knew the truth to the wait times... Great views but too much time wasted for us. So much to see in 3 days. Upon checking out of the hotel, we were charged for our incidentals, all was o.k. there. No double-billing etc. However, when I said goodbye and thank you to the front dest clerk, she looked at me and just nodded. We were never asked \"How was your stay?\", no \"Goodbye\" or \"Thank You\" or anything. I found this amazing for the service industry! I'm sure we could have done much worse in NYC but it seems that the Vincci Hotel group would do well to invest some training time for their staff and a little money on improving the details.", "Date": "March 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "pei, canada", "Title": "\u201cOverall great value but...\u201d", "Author": "gc01", "ReviewID": "UR4733210", "Content": "Arrived at the Avalon with reservation in hand after a long day of travel.

What impressed me the most was how safe we felt walking around this area at night(but that does not mean you should let your guard down). The hotel also felt very safe to be in. One major disappointment was that the breakfast was not complimentary. To me this is a big mistake by the new hotel management. All the review books and this site bragged about the great complimentary breakfast this hotel had. No longer the case. The breakfast now cost $17 per person! Needless to say, we were shocked by this and the front desk staff had a print out of the web site showing the breakfast under amenities was not listed as complimentary.

I have to say that the receptionist - Erick, was very courteous and patient, but after a long day travelling I was not happy to be told that the suite I had booked was not available and that we would not even get a refund despite having written evidence of the booking. I think the turning point was when I moaned that I hadn't even had dinner yet (this was at 9.15 pm) and Erick was obviously scared of a tearful woman with low blood sugar! So we did get the right room, but only after a real fight. We also did have our complimentary breakfast and did not have any problem with the staff who were friendly and quick. The restaurant was closed until our last morning, but the alternative room was fine. The room itself was large and the sitting area was pleasant. Our room had just had a new floor put down and the decor all seemd quite fresh. When the weather turned colder we asked reception to put the heating on which they did, but it isn't controllable so you are either hot or cold. The beds were rather small for two adults and we didn't want to sleep in separate beds. The location is very good and I thought it was good value for money. However beware asking the concierge to book you a taxi to the airport. My partner was told this would cost the same as a yellow cab, but the driver charged him $65!!!

The hotel is centrally situated in Manhatten and right round the corner from the Empire State Building and 5th Avenue. Times Square, Maceys, Broadway are easy walks.

Some of the furniture was a little jaded and the bath was very small for a 6'2\" body! But overall. very nice. The big down side is the heating system. The room control does not work and you have to get it turned on or off via reception. The problem is that when it is on, it sounds like a freight train. You do get acclimatised to it but we had to get it turned off at night as it is very noisy. I guess in the summer it wouldn't be so much of a problem when the weather is warmer. The complimentary continental breakfast was good, a nice selection of hard boiled eggs, meats, cheese, croissants, pastries, cereals, fresh fruit and bread. It easily did us until lunch time. They do have hot (eggs, bacon and pancakes) but there is a $5 surcharge. We found the continental very satisfying. You may see 'Complimentary Champagne on arrival' advertised, but they don't do that (or at least they didn't for us and when I asked they said they didn't do it!). We did have trouble trying to upgrade to an executive suite - lots of unanswered e-mails both to the hotel and parent company. Apparantly it's not policy if you book through an external agent. Most bizaar as we were willing to pay the rack rate difference and they had suites free. As it happened, we would not have had time to wallow in the Jacuzzi in an executive suite even had they let us have one.

The free internet in the lounge at the back of reception was very useful.

We had a terrific view of the Empire State Building from our room which was a hit with our children. There were no noises from above, below or beside us and the hotel was completely full. The location was very convenient to both the subway and shopping. There was a pizza place, Pete's Pizza, out the door to the left and straight across the street. It is diagonal from the deli listed in the previous review. On our last day there our train didn't leave until late in the afternoon.

And if that wasn't enough, we even got a free continental breakfast every morning. Just superb! The hotel is just round the corner from the Empire State building, and is right near 5th Avenue which is where much of the shoping is done. Maddison Sqaure Garden is also jsut 2 minutes walk away. The only problem we had (which was nothing to do with the hotel) was that one of our party had their bag stolen while eating in a mexican just round the corner.

The Positives first: A great price for a room large enough to handle a family of 5. It makes a big difference to the budget when we don't have to take two rooms, especially with the prices in NYC for the kind of hotel you would want your family to stay in, and we were very happy with the size of the room we had. The bathroom was excellent: large, clean and in excellent condition. The room had two queens (not just doubles) and a pull-out couch in the sitting room so there was plenty of room for everyone. There were two televisions in the room, one in the sitting room and one in the main bedroom, and kids really liked having their own tv. There is free internet access on a computer in the lobby, on a first come first served basis, and my kids really enjoyed being able to talk to their friends and catch up on the latest news from home. The breakfast included in the room rate (another big plus for families) was fine. We arrived for breakfast at various times between 8 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. every morning and there was always a nice selection of pastries, bagels, muffins, fresh fruit and fruit salad, cold meat, cheese, cereals and juices. We thought that the location of the hotel was fantastic. It's just around the corner from the Empire State Building and because it's so central we were able to walk to most of the sites on our \"Must See\" list. The Grayline Bus Tours stop at the Empire State Building as well so it was extremely convenient. There are a number of Korean/Japanese restaurants on 32nd Street within a couple of blocks of the Avalon (one of which is open 24 hours a day and which served a very nice teriyaki salmon though the Hot Pot was dry) as well as the usual Wendy's, McDonald's, Burger King etc. for the kids. The Negatives: The queen beds were made up with double sheets so the sheets tended to \"wander\" in the night because they weren't large enough to be properly tucked in underneith. The pull-out couch wasn't made up when we arrived so I had to call down and ask for it to be done - a pain when we were all exhausted from travelling all day. The Avalon also had the most bizarre thing I've ever experienced - the Hotel Office had complete control over the air conditioning in our room! We froze and we sweated at the whim of the Office. I tried calling and arranging when the a/c should be turned on and off every day so we wouldn't have to keep bothering them but they didn't pay any attention. It seemed as though the a/c would just come on at odd times, morning, noon and night. There didn't seem to be any connection between when they would turn the a/c on and the actual temperature of the room. I had to call the Office and make a request everytime we wanted the a/c turned on or off and while the hotel engineer sometimes got the msg immediately, sometimes we had to wait for hours and make repeated calls. It was ridiculous. Another irritation was the lack of an ice machine for guests' use. One has to call down and request ice (with the requisite Tip for the delivery of course). We decided to do without after the first day. And for some reason, even though I told them daily that there were 5 people in the room, we always only received four towels so we had to request more every day. And finally, one evening there was large inflatable Rat stationed in front of the hotel when we returned, evidently there was a dispute between the union and the owners; an unpleasant sight and not what I wanted to see on my vacation. I'm not sure if I'd want to stay at the Avalon again. The positives were great, but the negatives, though some may seem trivial, were a constant irritation for the entire week of our stay and it seemed as though no one in the front office cared enough to make things right.", "Date": "August 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat Style - but lacking substance\u201d", "Author": "Shallam", "ReviewID": "UR3795867", "Content": "My family (2 adults, 2 children) booked The Avalon because of the great Trip Advisor reviews.

Things were similar for the room as well. First off, when I stepped off the elevator onto the 12th floor, I was immediately greeted by the strong smell of moth balls. The room itself, # 1204, an executive suite, was disappointing as it was showing its age as well. The bed's mattress has seen better days; the furniture in the sitting area was uncomfortable (springs busted in the chair, the couch looked horrible). The only thing I thought was good was the bathroom; the all tile bathroom is nice and HUGE. However, even that room had a problem. The drip strip on the bottom of the shower door was partially detached and maintenance never fixed the problem. How difficult is it to fix a stripped screw? None the less, I did a quick fix so we could close the door. To top it all off, the local union was on strike with a huge rat on display in front of the hotel. There is nothing more pleasant than walking through a picket line to enter a property. As for staying at the Avalon again, it is not my first choice. My fond memories from years past are heavily tainted. Management has committed the greatest sin of any business, hording the profits and not reinvesting back into the product to keep its standards high.

We stayed at The Avalon for 2 nights. I had my expectations already high as I read many reviews before I booked and saw a few pictures and out of all others I reviewed, it was the nicest at it's price. My expectations were definitely met in terms of the atmosphere of the hotel & the room. It is a small older building with European charm & the staff was welcoming. But the best thing about it was that it is smack dab in the middle of Manhatten...literally steps from the Empire State building (Midtown). You walk outside, look up, and there it is! It was easy to get to and the valet parking was very convenient (considering finding parking in NYC isn't!). We checked in and went up to our room and were pleasantly surprised with how spacious and beautiful the room was. There was only the 2 of us, so the sitting room with couch & 2nd TV wasn't required, but we still enjoyed it as we were able to sit somewhere other than our bed to watch TV. The bathroom was spectacular! All marble...2 sinks, seperated tub & shower stall. There's even a phone next to the toilet...you know...in case you run out of toilet paper! We asked for a king-size bed and got one, which is always nice. The complimentary continental breakfast was neither here nor there. Coffee not good (take a walk to Starbucks instead) and you have to be there pretty early to get anything good. Both mornings we weren't down before 9am (goes until 10am) and we were left with stale bread to toast and a little fruit and cereal (if you like cereal). But hey, maybe we shouldn't have slept so late. And hey, it's free. There was 1 little annoying thing that went on that prevented me from scoring The Avalon with 4 dots...it was the room temperature. Unfortunately, the weekend we were there was not a nice one....it was very cold and rainy, yet the staff had just happened to turn the A/C on that very same day therefore no heat! The vent was not only loud because it was right about our heads where we slept, but it was pumping out very cold air. No matter what temp we set on the thermostat, it stayed on. It took me the 2nd day (about 5 phone calls) to have them turn it off and have them supply us with a portable heater.

We had a jr. suite facing the ESB with one queen size bed. The size of the room was quite comfortable and clean other than the furniture could use a cleaning. It had everything we wanted in the room. A safe, two tvs, coffee pot, refrig., iron and board, blow dryer, make up mirror and free newspaper during the week. My husband and I only drink decaf. coffee and the cleaning staff was nice to leave us extra every day per our request. We never had a problem with anyone bothering our personal belongings. The bed was small for us (we're used to a king size bed), but quite comfortable. The air conditioner was broke, so we just ran the loud fan all night. For us, that was not a problem as it got rather chilly at night, and we didn't need air conditioning when we were there, but for someone else, that might be a problem, especially if it's hot outside. The fact that the fan was loud was great for us as it drowned out the street noise, and we were right next to the maintenance staff elevator on the 3rd floor, so it drowned out that noise as well. We did have maintenance work on the a.c., but they were never able to fix it while we were there. We had requested a nonsmoking room and didn't get one even though I asked the front desk when we checked in if we got a nonsmoking room and she said yes. Well, there was an ash tray and matches in the room and it stunk of stale smoke (YUK). The location was good for us. The free breakfast was a nice touch (bagels, donuts, danish, boiled eggs, fruit, yogurt, juice, toast, muffins, cereal). I also liked this hotel because they did not allow pets, which I know can be a problem. I have three dogs, and they do bark when we leave them alone. Not good when you are trying to sleep with barking dogs. I liked the thought of not having to worry about that. Overall, I would recommend this hotel.

Everyone was coming from out of town. First, when I showed up to check into my room, they couldn't find the reservation. Being that it was my wedding weekend, I had confirmed it a million times. After 20 minutes, they \"found it.\" No apologies or anything for making me crazy. The lady tried to tell my mom she was \"just kidding with me.\" I don't think so, but even so, NOT A FUNNY JOKE! Next, my family went to check into their room. For 5 people, there was one bed in the room. The staff refused to do anything about it and when my aunt started yelling at the manager, they threatened to arrest her. Next, my new husband's friends from Wisconsin came to check in only to find that their room was only available for one night instead of the 3 nights they booked. The best man had to share his room with these friends so they didn't have to find another hotel. Next, my in laws friends from Wisconsin flew in to find there was no room for them. The staff actually said they had the reservation, BUT NO ROOM!! What is this, a Seinfeld episode?!?! My father in law had to leave our rehearsal dinner to go fight with the hotel staff. After hours, they finally \"produced\" a room. Next, my husband's grandmother's jewelry was stolen from the room. After all this aggravation, the hotel NEVER apologized for any of their screw ups, I had to pay for our room for every night and they weren't even nice to us. My wedding was perfect but the experience at this hotel put such a damper on things----me, my family, my husband's family and our guests were just horrified at how disorganized the staff is and how THEY WERE NOT EVEN THE LEAST BIT APOLOGETIC!!!

It seemed to be in the right place for everything - Empire State Building, Macy's and all the shops on 34th St, Madison Square Gardens.

We had a broken belt which buzzed for 8 seconds every 6 minutes all day and all night. The engineer eventually removed the fuse and we slept well after that.

We paid $169/night by booking early through Orbitz but friends who booked later only paid $209. They offer a complimentary glass of champagne in the restaurant and a complimentary continental breakfast. They also will provide comp passes to use the Bally's Fitness center located a couple blocks away. There is free high speed internet access in the rooms and a nicely stocked and moderately priced mini-bar in the rooms.

First time reserved through one of the major online hotel reservation systems. Upon arrival actually got an upgrade to what we had reserved. Nice touch! Unfortunately, the second time we again reserved through an online hotel reservation system. Upon arrival, the night manager informed us that they had no rooms. His explanation was that in the hotel business sometimes \"things happen\". Rather gruff. He at least refunded our money and paid for us to be housed at another hotel, so while it was a disappointment after a long day of travel, financially it worked out. The additional downside was that we were sent to the Library hotel and put in a tiny room, much smaller than what we had reserved. Third times the charm right? This time I reserved through the hotel's website thinking that even they couldn't mess up that reservation. Well, I guess they can. Upon arrival only standard rooms were available. Had another rather terse conversation with the night manager. In this case he didn't offer any compensation. I had two more reservations already in the system for trips later in the month. He told me that he would go in and put in his personal note so that we wouldn't be downgraded and did some work in the computer (I called back a week later and the reservations were only showing standard rooms, even though I had booked a King Suite and confirmed it with the night manager that night). I must be a glutton for punishment. I've reserved again, this time over the phone. We'll see what comes of it. Bottom line, it is one of the best accomodations for the price if you can get what you reserve.

Location-wise, couldn't be beat. Off 5th Avenue, extremely close to the subway, near lots of restaurants. Price was great -- included a glass of champagne on arrival (nice) and complimentary continental breakfast (never did try it -- sorry) so how could we complain? The staff was really nice -- let us check in early, gave us a room with sort of a view on the 9th floor, always helpful and smiling. The cons: 1. Everything was just a little bit threadbare and worn, albeit clean. 2. The section of 32nd Street on which the hotel is located is really tattered. 3. The odor of neighboring restaurants wafted up and into our hotel room window -- YUCK! 4. The rooms were cold --- they did have portable heaters and extra blankets but it was definitely C-O-L-D. 5. Zippo water pressure in the shower. :( 6. $9 for the house chardonnay -- yes, I know this is NYC and a hotel bar but even that is ridiculous.

Room also had two TV's with a good choice of channels, two large sets of draws, a large wardrobe with iron, ironing board, safe and an umbrella. Bathroom was large, spotlessly clean, with a WC bath/shower, hand basin and plenty of room to spread toilettries out, bathroom was all marble and there were plenty of towels in all sizes. Breakfast the next morning was filling. Three kind of juices, tea, coffee, milk, three cereals, whole bananas, apples, oranges, yoghurt, cut up fruit, muffins, pastries, bagels, jams etc, sliced bread and a toaster. Coffee and tea were brought to the table everything else was help yourself. We never encountered the really nasty waitress I had heard about! There was a short wait for the table on the Sunday morning but not after this, we ate about 9am. There was free internet access just off the lobby, which was usually only in use in the morning. The hotel was well placed, one block from the Empire State Bldg, five mins walk to Macys, 14 mins to Times Square (getting stopped at every light) 2 mins to the very handy No6 subway. Most websites stated 'Hotel Shuttle' under the facilites for this hotel, but they don't deal with any shuttles and will only book you a car to JFK for $60 which is dearer than if you booked yourself, so beware.

Required 2 rooms; 1 twin room and 1 double room both junior suites. Arrived and only had 1 double and 1 standard room available. Received guarantee via email from hotel back in June 04 (stayed Dec 04) confirming rooms required, but our first night both parties were in the incorrect rooms. After numerous conversations with the front desk and the night manager, on our second night we were finally in the correct rooms. Felt front desk staff unhelpful with problem even when night manager was involved - this may have been a one off as other hotel guests were happy with service. Plus side, bell staff were fantastic, bags were sent to your room so you did not need to worry about that, rooms were good, cleaned fantastically, breakfast filling as all you can eat continential, but would advise getting to breakfast either first thing or nearer 10am as can queue to get a table.

We stayed in room 1006 which is very spacious and well decorated with two 28\" televisions, marble bathroom, sitting area and a pretty good view if you don't look out the side windows (brick wall and water tower) but the front window (although over looks and alley) has a good view of two high buildings that were lit up in Christmas colours. The breakfast was fine to start the day exept for the waitress who never smiled and frequently spilled the tea( that is if you could get her attention) even though this was the only thing she had to do as it was a buffet style breakfast. The rooms are cleaned to a high standard every day and we could find no fault at all with the Avalon. On the last day our subway broke down causing us to miss our shuttle to the airport by 2 minutes, even though the hotel asked them to wait and then recalled them they refused to return or give us a refund for the return leg of the journey. The front desk guys did everything possible to get us to the airport, making phone calls and running outside to hail a taxi, if it wasn't for them we would still be standing there lost. Be warned about the \"Newark Express Bus\", bettter to stick with a taxi even though it is more expensive ($65 )but far quicker. The location of the hotel is great, 32nd street is a bit worn looking ((but totally safe)when you turn the corner and the Empire State building is right there it is \"wow\" also Macy's is a few minutes beyond that as is Manhattan mall which is nice but like any other mall in any city. Stick to Macy's you could be in there for days especially when they have a sale, don't forget you discount card in the hotel lobby or from Macy's visitor centre. We will definetly choose the Avalon next time we go to New York.
