{"Reviews": [{"Content": "duomo at your doorstep. My second time staying at this hotel, we paid 450 euro for 5 nights two adults and a child so i consider that i got value for money. The hotel may be considered more a three star plus so do not go with a four star expectation. Regarding the drain like smell i do not think it as bad as expressed in previous reviews. I stayed in the hotel in november so it may be more unpleasant in the summer months, however keep in mind that florence does suffer from sewage odour. Breakfast is pretty basic but quiet satisfaying for hotels in italy maybe slightly basic for a four star.

Very close to the Duomo and the Ponte Vecchio but Florence is a great walking city anyway.I must say the street noise in our second floor rooms made sleep almost impossible and the air conditioning was weak and noisy, not acceptable for the prices we paid. Bathroom in our room (209 I think) was very basic with a miserable shower and hardly enough room to turn around. I know it's Europe but a shower stall would be much better than a flimsy curtain that sticks to you and allows water to drench the floor every time you bathe.Staff was generally pleasant and tolerant of my weak attempts at Italian. Check in and check out were painless and efficient. I just wish our complaints about the AC had at least been met with empathy.I think there are probably better hotels available but as this was our first trip to Italia I have no idea where they are.

The room was noisy - due to the hotels location, it is an Italian city.2. The air-conditioning was obtrusive, especially at night.3. The hotel corridors occasionally smelled of drains,although this was far from uncommon in Florence. 4. The bedroom needed repainting and the plastering repaired.5. The en-suite bathroom was small, some of the fittings were cracked and the toilet seat did not fit the pan.6. The shower rose had 2 positions, waist level and out of reach!7.

The coffee machine in the breakfast room confused everyone, no matter what nationality, and was certainly not up to Italian coffee standards as far as taste was concerned.9.

Worse still is the dank dirty smell in the corridors.I realise that this is an ancient city but there is no excuse for blatant misrepresentation.

The one we were booked into was the Fenice Palace. Having read some of the reviews we were very concerned that the hotel may not be too nice. However, we were pleasantly surprised. It is extremely convenient for all the sights and only about 7 or 8 minutes walk from the SMN train station. On arrival a very apologetic receptionist advised that the lift was being dismantled as someone had dropped something which had rolled through the small gap near the doors. However, she instructed the porter to carry our suitcases up to our room, which was unfortunately on the fourth floor. We made it up the stairs without too much difficulty, although we were somewhat out of breath being two middle aged ladies. It was worth it though, our room overlooked the entrance to the San Lorenz market and the view was very pleasant. The room was perfectly acceptable and the bathroom was clean and tidy. Yes, if we had wanted a bath we would have had a wait as the tap was rather slow, but getting a hot shower was not a problem. A big plus was that the hairdryer, unlike in many hotels, was quite powerful and fitted the bill. We did not purchase anything from the minibar, but noted that the prices were also quite reasonable if we had have wanted to. By the time we had unpacked.showered and changed the lift was working again, but we managed to walk downstairs. The carpet was somewhat shabby, but there was no damp smell or anything like that. We had a good night's sleep, but the location of the hotel does mean it is a little noisy and light sleepers may have difficulties. We were shattered so slept the sleep of the dead anyway. Breakfast was served in the basement restaurant, which was a little warm, but the food was fine. There was a good choice of items and no one would need to leave feeling hungry. We found all of the staff very helpful and nothing was a problem, if you needed something a polite request was all that was required. I would have no problem recommending this hotel to friends and colleagues, I am not sure what the rate is, as we booked a package, but our total weekend, using a budget airline, cost \u62e2250 each, from Leeds Bradford Airport in Yorkshire, UK. We found the rail fare from the airport, via Pisa Centrale, to Florence was much less expensive than in the UK and, also, eating out was very reasonable. Museum fees were not extortionate and all in all we had an extremely enjoyable time. The only thing we would do differently, having the experience of hindsight, would be to split our stay between Florence and Pisa, as we took the train to Pisa and back one day during our stay, whereas if we had made Pisa a separate overnight stay, we would have saved a couple of hours sitting on a train.", "Date": "Oct 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR590356971", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "anlaby1976"}, {"Content": "DO NOT STAY HERE (POSSIBLE FOOD POISINING) When we left our shabby, smelly hotel room to go for breakfast, we found flies in the rotten fruit bowl at the buffet table, which can carry food poisining bacteria, warm yogurt which contain bacteria unless chilled, and awful grey and brown scrambled egg.

We were a block from the Doumo, the Accademia, great shopping, and three short blocks from the Train Terminal, where many of the day tours started/ended. At night, head toward the Uffizi (abuot 3-4 blocks past the Duomo) and there is non-stop street entertainers, musicians, tourists...very cool stuff! There is a tourist information center across the street (and to the left of the main entrance, facing the street). The neighborhood is ridiculously beautiful and fun, especially for a first time Florence visitor. 2. CONSIERGE was nice, for the most part (pardon one man dropping the F bomb in front of our party just once). Spoke english, and were helpful with most of our requirements (see #3 in Bad)3. BREAKFAST, although not 4-star, was still quite good. Get there early if there are tour groups in the hotel, as it filled up quickly. We aimed anytime before 8, and had no problems.Now the bad (this starts as soon as you get to your floor). 1. HALLS smell dirty (sometimes like the sewage system) and are usually FILLED with laundry carts, vacuums, the maids' cart (seemed to be there the whole time...even at night).2. BEWARE OF THE EMERGENCY EXITS! We stayed on the second floor and accidentally tried to get downstairs using the emergency exit stairs...they were blocked with mattresses, carts, garbage, etc! Please hope there is truly no emergency there!3. OUR ROOM (119) was dark, smelled strongly of urine (which we complained about to the consierge and it never got taken care of), the decor had not been updated since the early 70s (it seemed). The bathroom was dirty (esp. the floor), our box of tissues was never replaced when empty (when we got there). The linens' cleanliness was questionable (go back to urine smell).

All of this must be improved in order to avoid a complete boycott by international guests.", "Date": "Aug 17, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR656673551", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Convenient and Comfortable The hotel is extremely convenient and within 100 yards of the Duomo and street market.

I stumbled in to this hotel after the first hotel we planned to stay at was closed. So here I was I was traveling with two year old twins and a nanny on Christmas Eve and no place to stay! The staff was more than accommodating and helpful. I loved the old style hotel to begin with, I guess if you want modern this hotel isn't for you. I felt at home and relaxed there. The rooms that we stayed in were fine. I loved the fact that they had bathtubs!! A rarity in Italy. We moved to a larger apartment on the second day which provided a separate sleeping room for our nanny. The only complaint I had was that the apartment, being up on the top floor, would get a little warm at night. No problems with the elevators while we were there, I thought the braiding was a novel idea, I liked it. Breakfast and bar were fine. My children loved the staff and cried when we had to leave. Location of the hotel was great, walking distance to most of the attractions that we wanted to see, restaurants that were close and shopping markets all around us.

We stayed at the four star Fenice Palace in March 2003 and were absolutely baffled as to how this place managed to achieve a four star rating.Rooms and bathrooms were really unattractive. The brochure said that the place had undergone refurbishment recently but our room looked as though it hadn't been touched since the 70s. Every panel of wallpaper was peeling. Bathroom was cramped (v. little room between the basin and the toilet, which made for interesting experiences). And despite the fact that cleaning staff visited our room on a daily basis - evidenced by the fact that the beds were made - there was something on the floor (which we never did manage to identify but it looked sort of like food) from the day we arrived to the day we left (6 nights). Completely agree with the other reviewer's assessment of the lifts - unbelievable. Not to mention the fact that we were almost squashed countless times by the doors. The only thing that vaguely went a small way towards saving this place was the fact that the staff seemed quite friendly, but that was it.

Our biggest complaint about the room though, was that it was impossible to get any sleep during the night, as the hotel backed onto a very noisy street. Breakfast was also not of a 4* standard. At most points during our night and a half stay, either one of the two lifts broke down. Glue was clearly visible inside the lift, where it had been used to tack some braiding onto what appeared to be and only slightly harder than cardboard surface (which had dents in it). We were able to notice so much about the lift, as we were trapped in it for some time, and the hotel staff were unapologetic about either the room or our bad experience with the lift.
