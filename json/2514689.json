My mom has major mobility issues, and the room worked for her with her rented wheelchair. The rooms were comfortable - but we arrived in the midst of a 100 degree heat wave! Only one elevator worked at a time (out of three) and there we long waits. Then, on my birthday, I was stuck alone in the elevator. For a claustrophobic person, it was the fear of a lifetime! After 15 minutes or so talking to the staff on the elevator phone, they got it going, thank God. Stella at the desk (desk folk were lovely) promised me Starwood points enough for a night's stay as compensate. When i checked months later to use them, they didn't exist. I've called repeatedly. She hasn't been there once. Frustrating - and a ghastly experience, to boot. We went to the restaurant several times, due to my mom's problems moving around - dinner and brunch. It was decent, but overpriced and not overwhelming. The brunch was better than the dinner.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cFabulous NYC hotel we return to every year!\u201d", "Author": "ZenSwan77", "ReviewID": "UR127203704", "Content": "Just completed our 2012 booking for the W Union Sq. and realized we had neglected to review our wonderful May 2011 stay.

Doorman busy texting instead of doing his job. 3. Room assignment next to the elevator (#809), thus I was treated to loud guests outside my door until well into the wee hours 4. 8-inch long rust stain in the bathtub, disgusting that housekeeping is apparently so oblivious to maintaining a high standard that it was allowed to be there for a long period of time. I wonder how many weeks or months that stain has been there? How many other guests complained, and nothing was done about it? 5. Breakfast the next morning in Olives, and the waiter served jams with the bread basket...and one of the jams was opened, half-used by a previous guest, and obviously no one in the restaurant bothered to check when they cleared the table from the day before. 6. The hotel overall is in an old building, and the overall appearance is drab, and fairly shouting that a renovation is in order. 7. And I know low lighting is the \"style\" of W hotels, but at least make the bulbs work on the elevator room numbers. The elevators don't have the same matching numbers array, (i.e., the 1st floor number isn't in the exact same place on the panel in each elevator), and so it forced me each time to have to crouch down to see \"1\" clearly enough to push the button. 8. An indifferent staff attitude from top to bottom towards me as a customer. This may be \"New York\" style attitudes, but it doesn't excuse a lack of customer service. Oddly, the only other hotel I've ever experienced within SPG that exhibits this kind of staff indifference to the customer is the Westin Paris. I was told that it was just the \"Parisian Way\". Whether it's the New York Way, or the Parisian Way, bad customer service doesn't get a free pass from me. I also experienced a great deal of difficulty sending my complaints after the stay to the hotel general manager. The Starwood email giving me his address and asking for my feedback was no use, email sent to the address they gave me bounced back as \"undeliverable\". Eventually, customer service people contacted me, and while they said all the right words, the only way I'll ever know if their words are sincere and meaningful, and if this hotel is any better than my dreadful experience, is if I return to it again.

Now, about the hotel --a perfect mix of old and new -- and the old marble flooring and steps, ornate elevator trim, and antique office trinkets blend perfectly with the espresso furniture and purple satin linens. Rooms are spacious, well-appointed, and stocked with many amenities. Olives is delish, as are all Todd English restaurants. His signature chicken dish is my kid's absolute favorite meal. The only negative about the hotel is that it is so hip and trendy with twentysomethings that it's difficult to get near the bar or a seat in the \"living room\" on the weekends.

Went down, put me in another room in a similar predicament. the third room was a handicapped room on a higher floor where someone had been smoking so it was horrible. I gave up and stayed there but asked to move the next day. The 4th room was barely OK. Beds in both rooms were soft and uncomfortable. I can't remember complaining about a bed. Usually don't have a problem sleeping as I travel a tonne, but didn't have a good nights rest there. The rooms are outdated. There's no turn down service. The safe broke down one day and the door keys stopped working periodically. The elevators are extremely slow and you can wait forever to get something delivered to your room or to go down. When you walk in and out of the hotel, noone looks up and greats you. In fact, the front desk staff just seem so busy and annoyed when you ask for assistance.

The room was certainly large for NY, but would have preferred less space and a teeny tiny view/daylight. There was only one of the doormen who ever held the door open and no-one offered to help us with our bags to our room when we arrived. Additionally, I thought that the communal areas lacked space and wow factor. There were no seats in the lobby and never any free seats in the small bar and the lobby bathrooms were dated and utilitarian. We have stayed in the Crosby St & Soho Grand and much preferred both for ambiance. To be fair, if you had a room with daylight and used the hotel staff a lot (who, it is said, are very helpful), perhaps you would have a very different view.

There was rarely a doorman, and when there was, he was usually too busy chatting with people on the street (girls) to actually do his job. There was a family of three checking in before us who took forever. Couldn\u2019t seem to decide what room they wanted. So when it was finally our turn, we were told we had been upgraded. We got a room on the 21st floor but I\u2019m still trying to figure out what the upgrade was. The room was very average and poorly laid out, but maybe just a bit more spacious than the typical NYC hotel room? Either way, it seemed pretty shabby for a W. The air conditioner made an annoying whirring sound, the lighting was bad (the desk lamp didn\u2019t even work), the shower could\u2019ve used a good thorough scrubbing (though the shower pressure itself was great), the closet door got stuck on the room door (hard to explain) and so on.

Check in was quick and efficient, and I was quickly in the lift heading to a high floor room. The room was big (according to my standard which is mainly London, where they may classify as a suite something over 250sqf -or even less-). Then I waited for a colleague who arrived 2 days before, but was leaving the Hilton Millennium due to the noise associated to ground zero building site. (to be honest this Hilton is a better choice for us since our NYC offices are located in the World Financial Center Just across ground zero building site) As soon as he checked, direction Concierge to book a table at the strip house for 3, my boss had called to ask what were the plan for the night (very good steak and usual poor/amateurish service you can expect in NYC, strangely enough only in Restaurant). For me and my colleague as 2 French persons (our boss is English) the most important part of the day was done (securing food) we headed for the UNDERBAR, so we passed near the Fitness room (not very attractive, but I am not a sport person) which looks very attractive base on some reviews for our first G&T, this was a disappointment, dark and gloomy, mainly looked like the interior of a bunker (and we were nearly the only ones). No problem then up to the bar in the lobby, where we were supposed to meet our boss (and our 2nd G&T) the place is heaving looks so trendy, really a place to see (and be seen ?, will leave this one to NYC residents) after a third G&T... (no we stopped at 2, we were having dinner with our boss, you may have a look at Strip House New York for more info -but still not written-) we headed for dinner (we had the 3rd one back in the hotel). the location is great, Tube/Subway? is just round the corner and as soon as you understand how it works you can be anywhere in Manhattan within minutes. and if you want something special you can get have a look at the Union Square Farmer's Market (Mon,Wed,Fri,Sat looked at internet to give accurate information) the market is across the street and provide quite a choice of food from the New-England and Canada as well as American natives art) Very good as well for the one, who do not like restaurant on their own, there is a Whole Food across the square (for the non US reader, Whole Food is a grocery/supermarket providing normal vegetable, take away foods AND a dining area and microwave after the tills. My favourite choice on a city tour. Checkout was very efficient and it was time for fly back to Germany for a week before visiting the Waldorf Astoria. Final judgement: I will definitely recommend the place, (without GF, except if she looks like a top model, since a lot of girls in the lobby bar do look like it) localisation is perfect. only issue was the price, got a lot of more enjoyable stays at at other (Starwood) properties in NYC/NJ, However this place may be attractive for me but not other people (W Hoboken, stay tuned)", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville", "Title": "\u201cBEST HOTEL IN NYC\u201d", "Author": "jkdarwin", "ReviewID": "UR97620420", "Content": "I can sum up my recent visit at the W Hotel in Union Square with one word \u2013 FABULOUS!

The room we stayed in was a good size, with a great bathroom, but the hallway and room had the lingering odor of smoke covered up by air freshener. Our friends were never notified when their room was available, as promised;their room didn't smell, but they could hear the Park Ave noise. The hall rugs were stained from what looked like some water damage. The bill for the room across the hall was slid under our door. The final letdown was that the turndown staff stole my powder makeup (really? makeup?). And when I told the front desk person, I got the same hurried, mumbled, robot-like response ('my apologies for the inconvenience'...that's about it.).

Olive's (one of the first Todd English, Boston spinoffs) has the best menu with food prepared by a very talented kitchen. Server's are helpful and knowledgeable. Great for breakfast, brunch, and dinner. Underbar has a wonderful selection of drinks, a full selection of beverages, and delightful bartenders. These places can get loud at night but the rooms are always very quiet. Neighborhood is one of the best in NYC. Great central location. Only downside is they are not inexpensive but they are worth the price (especially if you hunt for special deals on the website).

My assessment is based on many stays at this hotel and extensive experience with other fine hotels in New York, in major cities around the United Stastes, and in other parts of the world. The physical reasons are plentiful: excellent location with easy access uptown or downtown -- a neighborhood with some of the city's greatest restaurants a short walk away (Gramercy Tavern, Blue Water Grill, Gotham Bar & Grill, Union Square Cafe, Veritas, and literally hundreds of the best are nearby). Business entertaining is thus easy and pleasant, and could include the hotel's Olives Restaurant, run by celebrity chef Todd English, where I often hold business breakfasts. The rooms are spacious, with great beds, great showers/bathrooms, and an outstanding work area with high-speed internet access. The very good rasio alarms also have Ipod docking stations. I get tons of work done very productively there. Across the street, Union Square always is bustling, and on at least three days a week it boasts the finest farmer's market in the city. What a treat! After visiting the terrific restaurants, sushi bars, seafood houses, barbeque joint, and green market within a two-block radius, the W allows you to work off the calories in a superb fitness center stocked with first-rate equipment. The rooms are cleaned and stiocked masterfully by the excellenrt \"room stylists,\" who always address even the most minor special request (e.g., extra linens or such). But those are just physical attributes. As with human beings, the true beauty of a fine hotel goes way beyond physical beauty. The spirit that sets this place apart comes from an extraordinary team of people, and their passion for true hospitality. I've always been delighted by the service at W hotels (have stayed very often at the one in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and elsewhere, including the superb Court and Tuscany hotels on E. 39th St.). At the W Union Square, it's the W spitrit on steroids. The good feeling starts with the best front door team (known as welcome ambassadors), to an amazing front desk team, to extremely helpful concierges, and to great customer relations specialists and managers. I know many of them by name and would like to mention them here, but I am afraid to omit anyone. They consitently come through for me every time a stay there, and they make me feel like family -- on every visit, at least a couple of the guys at the door ask for my wife, who they've met; it means so much to me that they also make her feel at home when she comes. The W Union Square gets my strongest recommendation, as many of my friends and colleagues know.

I have stayed at more then a dozen hotels in NYC. I will name a few to give you an idea of the range: Ritz Central Park, SoHo Grand, Tribeca, Gramercy Park, Royalton, Four Seasons,Trump International, Regency, W Times Square, W Lexington, and the Waldorf. I am no novice! I tend not to care for really large hotels because I feel like service is often a casualty in those places. The boutique hotels seem unable to have things like gyms or business centers in there, or worse 24-hour room service.Once I stayed at the W in Union Square, I have not stayed anywhere else. This last time I stayed for a week and there was a snow storm while I was there. I needed to extend my stay and Natalie at the front desk was able to accomodate my request with no fuss and no muss. The rooms are really large( for NYC) unlike some of the trendier hotels that think a closet will do as a room.The rooms have flat screen tv's, dvd players, iPod docks, wireless internet and there is a buisness center. I thought that staying on Park Ave South, as opposed to mid-town would be a hassle, but actually it was great because the cabs could shoot straight up or down Park Ave and I could get anywhere in the city very quickly. Park Ave. happens to be both ways which is nothing short of a miracle in the city. The location was great to walk around to nice restaurants as well as the famous farmers market across the street. There is a 24 hours store next to the hotel, a Sephora and a Branes and Noble across the street, as well as a CVS at the end of the block, and all came in handy.There is no spa at this hotel, but there are so many in walking distance. This time around I even found a great Pilates studio 3 block away.The food at the hotel is unbelievable and 24 hours, it is also not $100 for breakfast like most high-end hotels in NYC. I think their calamari is the best I have ever had, and I grew up in Italy.There is a really nice and CLEAN gym.The products in the bathroom are all from Bliss, so I never have to pack lotion since that is the brand I use anyway. There is an Olives by Todd English restaurant on site and they have the most divine Brunch there, we are fond of the banana whipped cream. The best part of the hotel is the staff. They are really kind, attentive, and efficient. There is no sense of aloofness as I have found in other W locations from their staff. This is from the guys that open the doors and get your bags to the managers, who can can be found getting your bags too , they are all so professional. The check in and check out has no headaches and no surprises on your bill either, believe me this happens more often then not. I needed to go to Fed-Ex a few blocks away with my luggage, since it is cheaper to mail my luggage these days then to fly with it, and Stella at the front desk arranged for me to use their complimentary Acura car service. It was really at the last minute and Stella was able to do that for me quickly and painlessly. She also had me checked out, with my bill ready for review by the time I came downstairs and I was able to make my flight.I have also brought my nephew, he is 5 here, and the staff was so sweet to him. I am bringing him back for spring break this year and he is already asking if they can stay at the W , since he was spoiled rotten by the staff. I love the way this hotel looks, the smell form their candles, the extremely large and durable W umbrellas that came in handy during this last trip, the different waters by the front dest right net to the granny smiths apples.

So, they made their reservations 2 weeks ago, received a confirmation letter and took the flight all the way to here...ONLY to be told by the front desk upon their arrival that their card was declined..Doesn't sound \"that\" abnormal, right ? Well, this was a PREPAID reservation (which means, at the time of the reservation they charge you!) and they got a confirmation e-mail welcoming them to the hotel (extra fancy as they were Platinum Starwood Preferred Guest members). And, the very very very very unprofessional and very uneducated annoying front desk clerk literally said \"Oh, that's not my problem sir! They should have checked their credit card balance everyday!\".. This is W Hotel at Union Square, not a $50/night student motel in Bronx! And, when I asked why weren't they notified at the time of the reservation or during the TWO WEEK period between the reservation and their arrival about this decline issue, the annoying front desk supervisor gave me a very simple answer \"Oh we don't do that! We can't deal with all the customer's card issues!\"... Yes, you let them fly 10 hours to New York City and tell them that their card is declined and not even apologize for your attitude... When I asked to the other front desk clerk \"How many managers do you have at this hotel ?\" With a very rude tone, he said \"We have several\". Then I asked \"How many and who are they ?\", he unbelievably replied; \"I SAID SEVERAL, OK ?!\"... My guests are people who stay in many different Starwood Hotels all over the world (including W Hotels in US and abroad) and again, they had high-balanced Starwood Preferred Guest Cards and a freaking confirmation letter! Yet, this terrible and unbelievably unprofessional attitude.. I simply cannot believe it... The much reasonably priced hotel I was staying two blocks away (Hotel Giraffe) had amazing staff, despite its price. And, when I called all the necessary people about this, they weren't much helpful and one representative guy on the phone literally said \"So what do you want ?! Free nights or something?\" And, I learned that out of all of the W Hotels in NYC, only the Union Square one is INDIVIDUALLY OWNED! Which probably explains it.. So, make yourself a favor; save your couple of grand and get a different W Hotel or a different hotel in Manhattan!...

Because we were staying for a business meeting, we had a regular room which was on the small side but it was beautifully decorated. I would ask for a room with a window to the street. We had two windows that looked on to an alley and it always felt dark in the room- may not bother others but it bothered me. It's diagonally across the street from the Union Square Greenmarket which offers local produce & goodies several days a week in the pretty Union Square. This is also a great location. We never had a problem getting cabs. Good shopping nearby- a huge 5-story Barnes & Noble, Sephora, Geox, Filene's Basement, Whole Foods...", "Date": "October 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel + Great Location = A Perfect Weekend in NYC\u201d", "Author": "CMW76", "ReviewID": "UR46147423", "Content": "This review is a little late in posting as my trip was back in July, but I just wanted to finally post something on Tripadvisor, so here it is!

I booked a Wonderful Room which we were quite happy with. It was very clean and we loved the look of the room. Another reason why the W is a great place to stay is because of the location. I always enjoy going to Union Square, and it was even better during this trip because when we walked out of the hotel the next morning, we walked right into a huge street fair that stretched down for a couple of blocks. We didn't know anything about it, so it was a nice surprise. We spent the next couple of hours checking out the booths, shopping, eating, and then made the short walk back to the hotel to rest, and then dinner and a movie later that evening, also just walking distance away.

We booked a King room with a rollaway bed (for 3 adults). When we arrived at the hotel, they claimed to not have a room available per our request. They blamed it on hotels.com (they said that hotels.com shouldn't have allowed that category of king room to have a rollaway bed). In lieu of what we had booked (and paid for in advance), the front desk offered us a king bed only. He said that all 3 of us could sleep in the bed! We politely declined this 'offer,' upon which he countered by offering us the 'best he could do' - a double room on the smoking area. He said that was all they had, and to take it or leave it. We agreed to look at the smoking room, but after getting off the elevator on the smoking floor (it stank), and opening the door to the smoking room,( it also stank and had a huge brown stain on the carpeting), we decided we couldn't bear to be in that room for 2 nights. We went back down to the front desk to let them know we couldn't stay in the smoking room, and they told us to call hotels.com and ask for a refund, then start finding other accommodations! They said they were totally booked that night and that others were walking in off the street looking for rooms. It appears that the hotel wanted to 'sell' our fairly inexpensive room to 'off the street' travelers willing to pay the full retail price. When we told them we were unable to reach hotels.com (we hung up on after being on hold for 20 minutes), we asked for a W Hotel manager. After another 15 minute wait, they miraculously had an opening of a king room with a rollaway bed. That is exactly what we had originally booked at hotels.com!

Booked in with the Starwood free weekends promotion so only paid for two of the nights. That said, I felt the stay wasn't worth paying two nights at the 450 dollar rate, much less four. This was my first visit to New York City so I have no other hotels to compare it to but when I have stayed with the Starwood brand at St Regis for half the price I've been treated much better and the accommodations have been nicer. Location: Union Square was a great location. Honestly, I choose to stay with Starwood on this trip because I had earned two free weekend nights and I choose this W because of the location in Union Square. Doorman: These folks were not a very welcoming bunch. I guess I'm just not a hip enough chick for them. I finally got so fed up with the attitude, especially that of Frankie, that I spoke with the manager, if for nothing else but to make me feel better. I don't appreciate getting treated like scum of the Earth. I would ask about the house car and he'd be put out. I'd ask for a direction and he'd be put out. I'd ask if we could get a cab and he'd say sure and motion to the street. he was horrible, but the others were indifferent. Checkin: Was the quickest ever. Just need to see id and credit card, here's your key. No nicey nice-no do you know your way around....nothing. When I was at St Regis Monarch beach last week not only did I pay half the price, even with free nights, but the staff were welcoming and a doorman led me to the room and helped me with my bags. Room: I had called ahead and asked for a quiet room. My husband is a Gold member and we were upgraded to the third tier of rooms-not a suite, a corner room on the 18th. It was quiet the first two nights but the hotel was full on the weekend and you could hear the guests in the room next to us, people talking in the hall, etc. You could also hear tv's, hair dryers, etc. The room was a good size but it was pretty basic. There was nothing special about the bed. I even looked under the sheets and it was just a regular mattress. The sheets were better than standard. The desk and bedside table both had a sticky substance on them. Bathroom: This was quite standard. I was very disappointed with the towels-they were like grungy old gym towels, not luxury or fluffy. There was only one robe so I had to call down and ask for one for my husband. I have a huge pet peeve when there is not soap for both the sink and the bath as was the case. I called down and requested another bar and it was left in the room. They were very stingy with the Bliss bath products. There were two of us and they only gave little bottles once a day. Now it was very hot in New York City. I'd take a shower to get ready in the morning, rinse off at mid day and then shower before bed. We never had enough product but they never replendished at night. WiFi-I'm so sick of WiFi charges in rooms. For the price I paid it should be free! I did go down to the lobby, or as W calls it the living room, and got on the free WiFi. Lobby Bar-I think this is still the part they call the living room. We did have tasty tator tots and drinks there. And the server was nice. HUGE plus! Whenever/Whatever: Or as I like to call it, What a joke. Any time I called they acted like I was putting them out. And I didn't even ask for a bathtub of hot chocolate as the silly W ad states. I just needed simple things, like a toothbrush since I left one behind, a bar of soap for the sink, security to quiet my rowdy neighbors so I could have a decent night sleep, a wakeup call.

I used to live in NY and so was familiar with Union Square, and so selected the W because of its location, which is fantastic. In the area there are great restaurants of all price ranges, from Olives in the hotel lobby, to the food bar immediately next door, to the street vendors selling halal food and fruit. The staff was quite nice, friendly and very helpful. The hotel was modern and trendy like all the Ws. The bar seemed to be a happening spot. The rooms were quite large in comparison to the normal NYC hotel room. The bathroom was also sizable, the beds comfortable, and there is a DVD player and great I-pod docking station with a stereo that has good sound. I loved the Bliss Spa products in the hotel room and the apples and free coffee in reception. My complaints are as follows: a really dark hotel, trendy does not mean that it needs to be dark. We were on the 15th floor with a view to Park Ave South but it was still dark even with the curtains open. No cotton balls, shower caps, etc in the bathroom. They probably would have given it to me if i had asked but i didnt bother. Only one bath robe in the room, even though it is a double. For the first two days there was no garbage can in our bathroom, which was annoying. Again, if i had asked they probably would have brought one. It took them forever to bring us a crib for our daughter. These are nitpicky things, but overall we had a great stay and i like the hotel.

We were originally going for one night and had gotten a great rate, and decided to go down a day early. The hotel extended the great rate to us for the additional night as well, even at the very last minute. Once again, the staff was personable, helpful, and professional, and our two dogs were treated great as well. Having the dogs, I usually ask that our room not be cleaned since our dogs are older and someone being there would make them nervous. So when I travel at hotels I try to catch one of the maids to do a towel exchange, etc. At so many other hotels, when I do that I sometimes feel as though they are nickel and diming me like, \"So you are giving me two bath towels back, three glasses, and you need just shampoo?\" At the W, the maids just brought me a whole new set of towels and amenities, without trying to do an \"even exchange\". I actually had way too many towels and left the unused ones on the bench, but I'm sure they probably had to wash them all again, but they weren't concerned. It was so nice that they just make that so easy and smooth. The only hard part with having our dogs (and this has nothing to do with the hotel) is that Union Square park is really busy in the summer, and so it wasn't great to take them there during the day. (The park has a dog run but my dogs being older don't do well with other dogs). So we did find a much smaller area that had some trees about three blocks away. I think it's a challenge in any park in NYC (except Central Park) where the dogs aren't really allowed on the grass. My country dogs had to get used to being city dogs for a couple days, which was an adjustment! :) It was fun to see all the vendors lined up in Union Square Park this time of the year, and again, the W was just a perfect hotel for luxurious comfort, style, and attentive staff.

We had a difficult time moving around each other while getting dressed. There was only one comfortable chair in the room. The room only had a shower, no bath tub. This is definately not a kid friendly place. The lobby was also small and the seating seemed to be in constant use. The location is a good one during the day. Itis close to a number of NYU facilities. There have been some issues involing violence in Union square recently. The price to value ratio is the primary reason for the lower ranking If you are thinking about holding a catered event at the hotel, I would think twice. The event we attended had an open bar but not enough bartenders. The hor dov's were brought out on small plates that only held 12 hov dov's. They were passed around by the waiters. The waiters and their tiny little trays barely made it into the room before all of the food was grabbed up by the staving crowd. They also took a long time between bringing out additional plate of food. I gave the impression that the waiter may have been preparing the food. There were over 100 people attending the event, some were elderly. There was inadequate seating provided for older guests (people in thier 80's) .

RESERVATIONS/CHECK-IN/CHECK-OUT: This is the worst part of my stay. There were some glitches were due to some circumstances, I had to postpone my stay from January to May. I had booked online via their website a deal where if you buy two nights you get the third free. Perfect! When I learned that I would not be able to make my original trip, I called the hotel---I had to call 10 times to get a manager--when I got a hold of the manager, they told me, no problem and moved my reservation. This was 4 months before my arrival. One week prior to arrival, I called to confirm my reservation. I was not anywhere in their system. I sat on hold for 30 minutes while they tried to find me. Finally, somehow, my starwood preferred guest program booked me under my maiden name. Fine, no big deal. I have a room over looking the park, right? I was assured I would. I called day of arrival to let them know my flight was delayed, but I would be there between 11-12 so to please hold me room. I was once again told no problem. When I arrived at 12am, I was told they were completely sold out and that I would in-fact not get my room. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I was tired and I said I didn't care, just put me in a room and we'll figure it out in the morning. I was assured that I would get compensated for my trouble because they did note that I had called and said I would be there. Upon check out, I checked my bill and saw no compensation and some other charges that I couldn't figure out. I spent a half hour at the front desk straightening out my bill, but finally got it squared away. ROOM: I had a mega room (on my second and third night) which is the largest below a suite. It was very large and spacious with views over looking the city below. (we were on the 19th floor). I didn't hear any street traffic or people in their rooms. Every once and a while I could hear people in the hallway, but only if they were loud. The bathrooms were very large with a separate tub and shower. The robes were soft and luxurious and there were bliss amenities. A large flat panel TV and a docking station for my ipod/iphone. The beds were comfortable and the linens were soft. The cleaning staff didn't bang on our door early in the morning, but we were out of our room by 10:30 am. *I was a little surprised to see that the hallways leading to the rooms were stained. This is the only part that I thought needed improvement* RESTAURANT/BAR: These were swanky and attached to celebrity names Todd English and Randy Gerber. The lounge area was always packed with those wanting to see and be seen. They poor stiff drinks, so be careful! I got tipsy pretty fast! The food at Olives was good. Ultra modern decor with white square plates, exotic plants, straight lines, crisp linens (you get the idea) we only ate breakfast there, but the service was great as was the food. Fresh baked bread for my toast. Warm eggs, crisp bacon. LOCATION: This is central to everywhere you want to be in NYC. You are close to Greenwich Village, Soho, East Village, Tribeca, the Meat Packing district and just a few stops on the subway to Times Square and Central Park. If you have time, go to Supper in the East Village, the best little Italian joint (It's cash only though) There is a Starbucks, Barnes & Noble, Whole Foods and everything you may possible need within a two block radius of the hotel. OVERALL: A great, comfortable stay and an even better location. Hopefully next time I come back I will not have the same problems with check in/check out. But, I would definitely come back and would recommend this hotel to hip, modern couples without children. I think the noise and loud music may be a little too much for families.

I had a great experience with the staff, they were friendly and helpful without being either over officious or haughty. The room was ok - pretty clean, average room decor. My problem was with the overall atmosphere of the hotel. This is not somewhere to stay if you are there for business. The noise in the lobby was overwhelming; they blasted the most laughably horrid techno dance music at all hours, which was not particularly enticing when I had to wait for people in the lobby at 9am on Sunday. It wasn't at all enticing on Saturday night. It was just annoying. And the decor screams \"trying too hard to look hip\" - the whole design is just overdone. I met a friend of one of the designers while in town and got an earful about the \"corset\" lampshades in the lobby and I have to say that they were too subtle to even be noticed. Overall, the hotel looks like a mishmash of someone's idea of hip decor. The W designers just tried way, way too hard. The main problem most people have with all of the W hotels is the bizarre lighting. For some reason they like to keep their hotels dark. Dark lobby, dark hallways, dark rooms, dark, dark, dark. Again, this is not the place for a business trip, if the meeting-preventing lobby racket doesn't deter you, the gloom (sorry, mood lighting) probably will. This is not a place to get work done. I was in NY for pleasure, and I found this hotel really distracting and annoying. I just don't get what the hotel is going for: Why the calming lighting but loud jarring muzak blaring 24/7? Why the sweet little patches of grass on the front desk but nightmare before Christmas lights? And can we dust the DIY-looking flower lights in the lobby once in a while? And while the lights are dusted can we hose off the plastic plants? The whole lobby looks a little worn out from all the nighttime partying going on downstairs. If you ask me, you can go to a hundred other hotels in NY that won't cost as much and won't be as god-awful annoying. If you are a tourist, it really doesn't give you a \"NY hotel\" feeling, it feels like it could be anywhere.

The bathroom was clean and quite large. The water pressure was excellent and hot water immediate. The water pressure in the sink was so high that it would splash all over you if you turned it on full blast. We went to the Underbar through the \"VIP\" entrance in the basement.

We loved this hotel's location in Union Square and knew that we'd be getting good service and a nice, modern room when going with the W chain. In that sense, the hotel totally met our expectations. The Room (A-) Bed was truly \"heavenly\" as they like to call it. We requested the highest available floor and they put us directly below the Penthouse (nice that they were paying attention to my internet request). The view is pretty nice from up there. By NYC standards, this was an average to above-average sized room. Nice modern decor, clean, with a large flat-screen TV and DVD player. The bathroom door was a slider and you could hear everything from either side - that is probably the only con. Well, that and the price, which I thought was a little steep when you add $50 in taxes and parking charges, which I will get to... The Service (A+) They have a \"Whatever, Whenever\" motto and encourage you to request anything you might need. We took them up on this, as we had our wedding cake topper (1 year anniversary), but no plates or utensils to eat it with. We called down (and were greeted by name), and - no joke - in less than 2 minutes they were there with everything we needed. The concierge was very helpful during our stay as well. Added Fees (C-) They charge $60 a night for parking. This is valet service, but I asked if you bring your car to the garage yourself if it would be the same charge - it would. This is high for overnight parking, IMO, even for New York (where I have lived and parked overnight many times). As I mentioned earlier a $349 room is actually $400 with taxes. We did not order any, but I noticed that room service charges were a bit exorbitant and the one-hour massage costs $150 (I'm used to $100-120, again I am talking avg NYC prices). So... with great service and style comes higher prices. I guess that should be no big surprise, but just wanted to paint a complete picture for you.

Our bathroom was large with a seperate shower/tub and BLISS products, which are great! The room was noisy, but its NYC! The location of the hotel is perfect! Many great restaurants close by, Rosa Mexicano (guacamole made at your table), City Bakery (great bfast/choc chip cookies), Maxi's (Kobe hot dogs/fried cookie dough dessert), excellent food! The union square market is nice, many vendors featuring food, gifts etc. Also walking distance to many shops including the SOHO area. Lombardi's is great for Pizza! The subway is very close and the taxi's are plentiful. Okay, here are the negatives...the staff seemed a bit too pretentious for us. Many of them seemed \"bothered\" performing their required duties. However, the doorman on sunday was excellent-very helpful- and housekeeping during our stay as well. For \"several\" hundred dollars a night, I definately expected a higher quality of service. On check-in, I realized the concierge had written down a quote for the room approx $100.00 more than I agreed to online. Although, he did apologize and correct it when brought to his attention. The living room bar was extremely crowded each night, we ended up leaving and going elsewhere for a drink. The \"Underbar\" club is very dull, dark and boring patrons, but a great DJ and bartenders. The day of check out I recieved my bill with a room service charge we did not use. I called the desk and was told accounting was closed and it would be a couple days before fixing my bill. Thankfully someone with more experience was able to credit my account that day. I find it interesting this seems to be an issue with many guests staying here. All in all, we had an amazing time!

I had never stayed at the hotel before, but chose it based on the great location and after looking through the reviews on TripAdvisor. Two days before my arrival I was contacted by Heather at the welcome desk to talk about which rooms were available. When she heard I had a special occasion, she upgraded one of the rooms to a king suite with a complementary rollaway bed so three people could fit in it. She was extremely helpful and friendly all around, and had George at the concierge desk get in touch to let me know there would be a gift in the room for my birthday and to see if I needed anything else. I jokingly responded that it would be great if he could have Brad Pitt waiting. Our party had seven women arriving at the hotel at different times from different places, and the front desk was great about making sure there were keys waiting for each girl in her name at the desk. No one had any problems getting in the rooms. And we laughed hysterically when we got in the suite. The staff had taken the time to cut pictures of Brad Pitt out of magazines and put them all over. There was one in a frame, some on the TVs, some on the mirrors. There were also two birthday cards -- one signed by several members of the hotel staff and another signed from \"Brad.\" My fiance had also called the concierge desk to arrange a bouquet of flowers for me in the room, and it was there looking gorgeous. They also had left little bottles of flavored vodka on ice; a complementary gift package of Bliss body products and a W Hotel teddy bear as gifts for me. It was an amazing and very touching effort. The suite had a great view of Union Square, as did the Spectacular Room, which was much bigger and nicer than your typical NYC hotel room. The bedding is incredible. We ate at Olives the first night, and had the tasting menu. It was delicious and our waitress (forgot her name, but she was a very friendly blond woman) took great care of us. And the doorman was always smiling and quick with suggestions of where to go. I probably couldn't stay in this hotel if I wasn't using points since my employer would flip if I tried to expense that much for one night. (Usually I stay at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers when I'm in NYC on business travel.) But I would definitely come again and again if I can afford it.

The same was true for the sink \u2013 be careful not to splatter yourself. The bath was clean overall, but the shower showed some moldy spots that really should have been taken care of!

Something annoying that the W shares with many other hotels: poor lighting in the room. I appreciate soft light as much as the next person, but sometimes you want it bright, perhaps to pack, but there were only various reading lamps, nothing overhead. Only in the bathroom was there bright white light, which is exactly where I would appreciate the option to have less. The lobby area is busy and the adjacent bar area is always full. This is definitely a trendy place and quite noisy at night. In the morning, you can eat breakfast at the hotel restaurant, but you\u2019re probably better off at a nearby coffee shop.

Fantastic location, central everywhere really. Having stayed in upper Manhattan in the past we found the W hotel location more suited to finding out how the real Manhattan works, so close to the village, Soho, Chinatown and little Italy it was a mere walk away, that isn\u2019t to say that you cant take a stroll up Broadway to upper Manhattan as that to easy to do also, and a very interesting walk to (don\u2019t forget credit card). We also made the walk across the Brooklyn bridge into Brooklyn Heights enjoyed the walk no so far as to cause a glum face.

Usually, I use points from another hotel point program and stay free. In February, W did a promotion where if you booked with AMEX, you'd get one night free at a W hotel, so I decided to try at W Union Square. I'd heard it was a hip and trendy place, which has it's pros and cons. The pro is, it's fun and people watching is great. The con is, as a 36 year old woman I might feel a little \"old\" and out of place. This was not the case. When I arrived, I was welcomed by the staff and taken to my room. A few weeks prior, I'd requested a sunny room and they complied with a giant, corner room with a view of the park. Because they knew I like \"sunniness\", they brought me a giant sunflower and some fruit and champagne about 5 minutes after check in. That right there would have won me over in terms of personal touches and friendliness, but throughout my stay, the entire staff did little things to show they were anticipating my needs -- they even went so far as to bring me a tray of comforting things on a day I was sick. As for the room itself, it was a good size for New York and had a great view of Union Square. Unlike many hotel rooms in the city, this room had a full bath (soaking tub) with Bliss Spa products -- definitely worth talking about. I don't think I've ever been as impressed with bath products. The water pressure was very good and the hot water never ended. There were no coffee pots, however, the hotel sent up a coffee maker for me to keep in my room, so if you are a coffee addict, keep this in mind! Just ask and you shall receive. At night, the lobby does become somewhat club-like. It's a stylish, loud, see and be scene place. That being said, it's kind of small and there's so much going on that if you do happen to be schlepping through in your sweats, no one really cares. It's smaller than it looks in the picture. The \"living room\", a place to congregate and have drinks, is very small and I felt a little uncomfortable going there alone....so I didn't. Underbar is a different story. I went with girlfriends and we had a fabulous time. The waitress was super nice (which was surprising, since others have said the opposite about Underbar staff) and the music was a good mix. It was dark, so I think I wouldn't have minded going in by myself for a drink, though I never got around to it! Olives, the restaurant in the hotel, is incredible. My friends and I were seated in a big, comfy booth and treated like royalty. The chef (Todd English), who owns about 20 restaurants, just happened to be there that night and sent us loads of free samples because he'd heard we were all cooks. You can't go wrong with the hotel restaurant, that's for sure. Still, you'll want to get around. The W is a minute or two walk from the Union Square station, so in minutes, you can get anywhere in NYC. There's plenty to do right in the area. Sephora and Barnes and Noble are right smack across the street and Filenes, DSW Shoe Warehouse and a Children's Place are also very, very close. You'll want to take a subway or cab ride for finer shopping, though. The concierge knows what stores have what and will help you out. Restaurants in the area include Veritas, Candela, Union Square Cafe, Tabla and many more I can't think of right now.

For the hype and price-- and having had a much better experience a couple of years ago-- this place is a let-down. First, the check-in person acted as if she couldn't care less whether we were there or not. At Hilton's and Sheraton's, the check-in staff are almost overly-friendly-- perhaps the W folks at the desk think courtesy and a smile aren't cool. (I should add that the porters are extremely friendly and helpful.) Second, these days, charging for Internet connection is just plain nickel-and-diming. Here, including tax, it's $16 a day! Other little things: our room is comfortable, but, again, for the price, I expect a better television-- flat screens seem standard now at chains like Crowne Plaza, etc. This one is small and so far away from the beds, that the remote signal doesn't reach! Also, wall outlets with lamp and other electrical cords hanging every which way. And, there's graffiti scratched into the leather headboard of one of our beds! At first we thought it was some clever Basquiat-like art, but clearly, it's just plain scratchmarks from some previous guest. Finally, and it's just a small thing, but again a nickel-and-diming item, we ordered a large pot of tea from room service - $8. The large pot of hot water arrives with one tea bag, so we asked for one more bag, and they charged us another $8. PUH-LEEZE! For the price, you can find a hip hotel with much better customer service and sense of pride!", "Date": "February 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cChristmas in New York but no restaurant service\u201d", "Author": "Peagreen98", "ReviewID": "UR6533448", "Content": "I have just got back from 5 days in NYC over Christmas where I stayed at the W on Union. I had a lovely room on the top floor with great downtown views, a good sized bathroom and by NY standards a large room (we booked a mega room). We arrived Christmas day from the UK and were greeted by a really helpful doorman. The check in however seemed an inconvenience for the desk staff \u2013 my passport is in a different name to my credit cards (a trial too far for her) and was then informed that the restaurant was closed for the evening and only room service was available. Here we were in NYC without a booking for anywhere on Christmas day to be told only at this point that the hotel restaurant was closed \u2013 it was here that the door man got helpful with suggestions of places to go for a drink or a \u201cbite to eat\u201d. I would have appreciated this information at booking or before arriving as I would have made plans. So room service it was and not really the choice I wanted on a romantic get away with my husband for Christmas. The hotel room was great but the service in both bars was hit and miss. This was particularly apparent on the weekend when it was more like a bar with rooms and preference seemed to be given to non hotel residents \u2013 that\u2019s not say it was a bad as the Hudson Hotel though, just that the staff had a tendency to be rude and unhelpful. We did complain to the lovely Australian night manager who was sympathetic although ultimately didn\u2019t do anything. I did however like the atmosphere of the \u201cUnderbar\u201d (which was open on Christmas Day and everyone in there was in great spirits). The highlight of the hotel experience though, was the really great room service guy who brought our breakfast every morning with his view on the weather and how thick a coat to wear \u2013 he was a tonic to the start of everyday. Apart from the bar experience this is a lovely hotel \u2013 its convenient, has great rooms and some of the staff are delightful. For a NYC hotel experience not too shabby.", "Date": "January 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, NV", "Title": "\u201cNice Stay at the W\u201d", "Author": "traveler213", "ReviewID": "UR6485443", "Content": "I stayed at the W Union Square for one night during an extended vacation in New York City. This hotel is in a great location for those who are familiar with the city (especially the subway lines) as it is convenient to the Union Square subway station, but not much else. While Union Square is a nice part of town, those who are interested in doing those touristy things like visiting the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Central Park and the other sites of midtown may find it a bit out of the way. The rooms are huge (by New York standards anyway) and very well equipped as can be expected at W hotels. The check-in staff was friendly enough but the girl who checked me in was not remotely interested in going above and beyond the call of duty in any way. Her attitude wasn't negative, but definitely more expected from an economy brand hotel than an upscale hotel like the W. Overall, great stay. The beds are fantastic and they provided a roll-a-way bed free of charge as a one-time courtesy. I'm not sure how much they charge other guests for this.", "Date": "December 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLovely NY hotel\u201d", "Author": "s0s", "ReviewID": "UR6093717", "Content": "I stayed for a comfortable, enjoyable two nights on a business trip.

I was given a lovely room on the 14th floor. In tune with the style of the building it had high ceilings and two huge floor to ceiling windows capturing rainy New York outside. The room was not newly decorated, but very well kept nonetheless. The staff were both efficient and friendly. I called for room service, laundry and had one minor problem with the heating.
