We are pretty discerning travelers and this particular property is a stand-out in so many ways. The grounds are beautiful. The walking paths around the lake are great for both fitness and wildlife watching. I love the little docks with benches -- a great place to end the day with a cocktail in hand. The pool is gorgeous -- probably one of my favorite hotel pools ever. We had a cabana for one day and it was a worthwhile splurge. The inside of the hotel is just as nice, with an inviting lobby and well-appointed rooms. The service was excellent in just about every way. There is a difference between being polite and being friendly, and I felt that every staff member we encountered was truly friendly, genuine, and helpful. We never felt like \"just another guest.\" This makes a HUGE difference. The food was truly great. Over the course of our 5 day stay, we ate most of our meals on the property and every one of them was delicious. We were fortunate to have a club level room, and I can't recommend this enough. This club lounge was unlike any other we've experienced. Wonderful presentations of food, switched out every couple of hours, combined with surprisingly attentive service and a relaxing atmosphere -- it was amazing. There was a separate area for kids with a TV, books, games, toys, a flat screen TV, and kid-oriented food. Our daughter loved this. One issue I must mention is that when we arrived there was a massive convention happening for the restaurant chain Texas Roadhouse. The hotel had been temporarily \"re-decorated\" with items relating to the convention and there were approximately 500 Texas Roadhouse employees staying at the hotel. Fortunately for us, the convention ended on the 2nd day of our stay so we weren't particularly inconvenienced by this, but I can't imagine we would have enjoyed ourselves as much if this was going on the entire time. When we arrived, they were doing relay races and obstacles courses out on the lawn all day. This involved constant shouting & singing into a megaphone. This could be heard from the pool area as well as our own room on the 14th floor. I would not have expected an event like this to be held at a property of this caliber. It just didn't fit, and for the short time that we overlapped with it, it was very distracting. I hope the hotel reconsiders events like this in the future because it does unfairly change the experience for every other guest staying at the hotel during that time. That aside, this is a truly amazing hotel. Our first stay (2 years ago) was very short and I was concerned that this 2nd stay might not live up to my expectations. But it did and it exceeded them in many areas. I understand that it is a 15-20 minute drive to many area attractions and some people would rather stay \"on property\" at places like Disney and Universal. I would rather spend a couple extra minutes getting to the park and then have a peaceful haven to return to at the end of the day when you're tired, cranky, just want to get away from it all.

The hotel itself is very large and is also part of the even bigger marriot which it adjoins. On check in we were advised that we had booked the Marriott not as we thought the Ritz Carlton which is apparantly not an uncommon error and whilst we had to pay extra to stay at the Ritz, we felt the problem was well handled by check in. The rooms are of a good standard with good bathrooms and showers and the day rooms are generous. The exterior of the hotel is like a large apartment block and not very attractive. Wifi is available free in the common areas downstair but an extra (how annoying) anywhere else. Breakfast is buffet style for a fixed fee or if you are on a B&B package and is very generous with a wide variety. its an extra if you order off the a la carte. Be warned that after 930, the restaurant gets very busy and waiting time of 30 minutes is not uncommon The hotel is on a huge site and as a result you must either have a car (valet parking payable per day) or be prepared to taxi anywhere outside the resort. Town cars are on standby outside reception at all time but be prepared for a 17usd fare to internaitonal drive or 29usd fare wetnwild or universal. My main negative would be that considering the ample availability of land, the pool area is just too small for this size of hotel. Its a bit like a zoo with all the children with no adults pool (the pool is only 3ft deep) and sunbeds crammed beside each other ... this isnt good enough for a 5 star hotel even though its a family resort.

I struggled with moving a large heavy umbrella and no one came forward to help. the only employee I saw at the pool was a waitress who came by our chairs at the end of the day, not to take an order, but to collect the menu that was on my side table. I was also surprised to note that there was no wifi offerred. I received no information about it during checkout nor was there any information provided in the room.

The Ritz which is adjacent to the JW Marriott (also a wonderful property) has something for everyone at a level that you cannot possibly find at a park property.

The restaurant at the spa is an unknown gem so even if you aren't using the spa, try it for lunch. The food is fresh and a pleasant change from normal vacation food.

It seems that the rooms have been slightly redecorated. I do not know if this is the case around the entire resort, but our room had some color scheme and accessory changes. It was all for the better. Additionally, in the past we have had to get two rooms because the suites only came with King bed options. However, we were able tot get a suite with two queens/doubles. This was wonderful because originally I was going to book two standard rooms but they could not guarantee connecting rooms due to the holiday. Normally, the Ritz would always accommodate such a request. However, seeing as we booked on Dec 24th for a stay starting on the 25th, this was understandable. The suite was meticulous, and house keeping was gracious and wonderful with our messes. Room service meals were excellent, as was the buffet at the Vineyard Grill. Oh, and the evening lounge French martini was one of the best I have ever had, and their cheese offerings were quite pleasant. I do wish they had larger lounge menu for late night snacking, but no big deal. Finally, they had a couple fantastic kid friendly items I must mention. They had a ballroom open daily each afternoon with two bounce houses as well as tables with games and crafts. This was a wonderful place for the kids to go and bounce their energy out after spending hours at theme park rides!! And most notably was the Gingerbread House Building Workshop. Not cheap - but truly wonderful. 150 dollars for up to 4 people - the kids wore chef hats and aprons and worked with a pastry chef to build a large and quite edible gingerbread house.

Very kid friendly without going overboard. My boys enjoyed the \"real\" hot chocolate and marshmellows available in the silver urn in the lobby throughout our stay. The daily fish feeding at 1 p.m. that also attracted an 8-foot alligator for close viewing. (Yikes!) The beautifully landscaped lazy river pool at the adjacent JW Marriott. The Gingerbread house in the lobby. The turn down service that \"tucked in\" their stuffed animals brought from home with accompanying chocolates. CONS: I wanted to take my boys fishing without a guide, but signs posted everywhere state alligators and snakes are present near their wetlands. Shop attendant told us not to worry because they take out the large alligators out of the lake. Someone forgot to tell the 8-ft croc that story. Passed on the fishing. No one seemed to know when the attraction shuttles come by, so if you are thinking about staying here and using shuttles, it doesn't really flow smoothly.

The Ritz and the Marriott share the same grounds and facilities so we made use of the pools and restaurants on both.

Even McDonalds provides free wifi. Hotel restaurants (at both hotels) were excellent, very good food, good service, but overpriced.

It is by far and away one of the most beautiful Ritz Carlton's in the US. When you are there, you feel like you are 'off the beaten path', away from the sometimes craziness of Walt Disney World and the other parks for which Orlando is known. However, a 10-15 minute drive will take you to the attraction of your choice. The hotel's lobby is beautiful, spa and fitness center is well appointed (the fitness center rivals a typical separate 'full service' club) and the food was excellent. We only ate at their casual restaurant, but it was quite good. Meanwhile, many of our 'meals' were courtesy of the rather extensive food offerings on the Club Level. At some R-C's, the Club Level may not be worth it. However, I would highly recommend paying the extra $ and booking a stay with Club Level access. Besides the food and service, the concierges that staff the Club room are a wealth of information and very helpful. As the hotel is in Orlando, you will find many more kids at this R-C than others. But, any unnecessary noise seemed to be less noticed in such a beautiful environment. (Besides, most families would probably want more economical accommodations, closer to Walt Disney World.) Finally, our room was top quality and had a beautiful view of the golf course, pool and waterway that runs through the property.

It starts from the moment you check in, when they offer you a bottle of water at the counter. When I asked them whether there was any place where I could buy an Orlando paper for my father (they delivered only the WSJ and USA Today to the rooms), they offered to get it for me and have it sent to my room. I expected to see something appear on my bill for this little service, but it was complimentary. Even though the Ritz has an old money, staid kind of reputation, I didn't feel out of place when I was there. They really seem happy when you ask them for things, which means that you don't feel awful making an extra request or two. Everyone, from the bell hops to the concierge to the spa and restaurant staff were just amazing--quiet, efficient, no nonsense kind of service that makes you wonder how much more functional the world could be if everyone adhered to such standards. As for creature comforts, well, this hotel was just full of them! The sheets, robes, and towels were the sink-into-them-and-sigh kind of soft. I was a great fan of the little slippers they give you in the room, and I admit to taking home a pair as a souvenir, though I thought I'd long moved past the steal stuff from hotels stage of my life. I was a bit awed by the amount of marble in the bathroom, but it's the Ritz, so I guess it's only to be expected. Housekeeping was top notch, as was turn down service (yay little chocolates). Rooms weren't huge, but they were comfortable and scrupulously clean. Loved the spa--though I'm not quite sure why they get to be #7 in the nation from Conde Nast Traveler.

Good bedrooms. We had 2 connecting deluxe rooms which gave us plenty of space for a family. Good room service. Staff are very good. Good breakfast - not the best buffet breakfast in the world, but covers most of the things you need. One nice touch was \"snack packs\" (eg. little bags of granola) for you to take away and munch on during the day. If you are visiting the theme parks (as we were) and don't want to stay in an on-resort hotel, then this is a great choice. You can leave the crowds behind and come back to your very civilised hideaway. It is very close to all the parks. It is also good value. They had very nice touches for the children, including a RC wristband which enabled them to go and get a little tub of ice cream from the front desk whenever they wanted. The reasons why it did not get 5* from us are threefold. First, although there is a decent enough pool, the hotel seemed to have little atmosphere. It seems as if it does not quite know what to be - business/conference hotel, resort hotel etc. This is reflected in the second reason, which is the restaurants. We found the dining options a bit limited, although you can easily walk to the neighbouring Marriot which adds a couple of options. We had mixed experiences at the Vineyard grill. However, I must report that after we were not very happy with the food, the F&B manager pulled out all the stops the following night and everything was perfect. That reflects the quality of staff which you would expect at a Ritz Carlton. Finally, they charged us $25 a day to park our car! Admittedly that was for valet parking, but they still charged something like $15 or $18 a day to park it yourself in a car park near the hotel. I am happy to pay for parking at a hotel in Manhattan or the middle of Paris, but not in the middle of Florida. Unbelievable. They should just stick $15 on to the room rate and save a lot of aggravation. We did not play golf, but the course looked beautifully kept. All in all we had a great stay.

Let me start by saying that you do not have to be a \"Millonarie\" to stay at this Hotel! Trust me! We got a package with our Airlane line that included the plane tickets, and the hotel stay- did I say that breakfast was included? Just in breakfast we saved at least 78 dollars a day with gratuities included. We had an ealier check in, oh my! the front desk, door man, parking attendants, were all extremely courteous ! Even with the early check in, we had a room upgrade! Rooms, well is a 5 star hotel! the pool is amazing, warm water, kids friendly and the surroundings so clean and peaceful. Since the Ritz and the JW Marriot are interconnected, you can use the Marriot facilities as well..the pool- lazy river, fantastic (if you plan ahead and bring your own tube-you'll save 7 dollars, but if you are willing to spend it, you can bring it home)- pool towels provided, water and fruits provided, kids menu is way cheap (10 dollars) , drinks reasonable price, room service all night, and first class! I mean what can I say...I found that my vacation package exceeded my expectations for the price paid- close to Sea World and universal (you will need to rent a car) and reasonable to Disney parks. The in room fridge small and with expensive snacks -so we did go to a grocery store and got our own snacks and small beveredges. If you get 1 room, please note that the beds are double, unless you request a bigger room, but is a pretty good size room, with tube, shower, separate restroom, etc.. toiletries come in handy and first class. Valet parking at 25.00 per day, is worht it, as the regular parking is 18 and you will have to walk. Casual restaurante and formal restaurant, good reasonable prices- Overall, 5 star in an affordable way. The trick is, book thru their website or as a vacation package with an airlane, choose end of week arrival and also look for their packages promotions. You pay for the room-you dont pay per person-you need a car to move around-by snacks at a Publix, and enjoy first class without ripping your pockets-compared to other packages at inside Disney 3 star hotels, it pretty much comes closer to what it cost-its your choice., I will come back again and for sure will take advantage or their Spa!

This year I came back for a family vacation, and thought of staying again at a Marriot Vacation property (good experiences). I thought of having different rooms for the kids, the kitchen for a fast breakfast, the evening family room, the washer and dryer. You know the story. Maybe just like myself, when you think Orlando, you think of a Villa. Lots of space and independence for all the family members. I couldn\u2019t restrain myself (as usual) of trying to push the envelope for something a little better. I usually don\u2019t travel on a predefined budget, but I try to get the most out of every dollar spent, regardless if it\u2019s one or a thousand. So of course I browsed through the helpful reviews and paid attention to Floridays as number 1 selection. Big rooms and great reviews. No way to go wrong, but it did! Please review my comments, just check in Floridays under \u201cterrible\u201d reviews. http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d612781-r116043391-Floridays_Resort_Orlando-Orlando_Florida.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT Just to their benefit, the assistant manager, Lisa Robbins tried her best to make it up for me, but it was too late. Floridays might get top reviews, but they are classified as a 3 star resort, and that is what you get. My harsh comments are the same, but an A+ for Lisa and her effort to rescue the name of the property. Now, finally, my comments on the Ritz. In terms of facilities, if you have been to the different Ritz properties, they are very much alike, (like a rich aunt\u2019s house: big, well kept and with very good taste), so they don\u2019t need any description. What really matters is the people that work here. I\u2019ve been to their L. Vegas\u2019, Washington\u2019s, Miami\u2019s, Palm Beach\u2019s, Bay area\u2019s and so on. I\u2019ve heard every single person gets 7 interviews before they are hired. It is clear they are all proud of working here, and it shows. I might have stayed more than 25 times and they still surprise me. I ended up here (still at the property), because I wanted to balance my previous experience at the 3 star hotel (a little mistake I did, since I took for granted that really great reviews only would apply to 4 or 5 star resorts), so I talked to the kids, and changed their \u201chouse\u201d for a room. So far, everybody is as happy as a dolphin in a show. And yes, I will rather buy more cloths than send my kid's dirty ones to the laundry, and yes it is more expensive to eat here. Doesn\u2019t matter. We love to feel at home and being taken care of. I called for special requirements the same day I moved in (7 nights after 3 in the Floridays, and 2 more pending at the RitzCarlton in Key Biscayne as a vacation of our vacation at the 1000 parks in Orlando) Tthey set up a small fridge, so the kids still have something to drink or chew at their leisure; the person who received me at the front desk, tried his best for the best available room, and so on. The pool at the JW Marriot next door is great for the kids and the property\u2019s pool is great for an evening swim. The resort is not as close to Disney, but for those of us living in Mexico City, a 15 minute drive there means a couple of blocks in the traffic, so I don\u2019t mind at all. Nothing replace the \u201cit\u2019s not in the menu, but the chef will make it for you\u201d. One more. My 9 year old misplaced her penguin backpack with I Touch, DS, first sunglasses and all her treasures inside at check in, just to find out until the next day I was about to give my I told you so speech, when the Lost and Found brought the backpack, sweater and all to the front desk. Nothing missing! They not only saved me the replacement, but a few hours of stress with the little lady. (I am a single parent, so anything that contributes for my peace of mind is a blessing) I told them about my requirements for a bigger room and they offered a suite as soon as one is available as an upgrade (hasn\u2019t happened yet, but it\u2019s only my second night) So, if you are used to this chain, the Four Seasons and similar resorts, don\u2019t hesitate and stay here. Forget about convenience and enjoy your vacation too. I\u2019ve finally had a couple of decent meals after all the pizza in the parks. Do not sacrifice convenience for service. Make it a vacation you too will remember. Kudos for the staff at the Ritz Carlton in Orlando.

The desk agent at the JW was very engaging and personable and made the relocation that much easier to accept. They did have some problems transferring our reservations to the Ritz-Carlton as evidently, they don't have the same reservation system. After 10 minutes or so, we were set to be moved. We go back out to the bell stand for the ride to the Ritz-Carlton. When asked how that would happen, he dismissively says \"You can walk or take a taxi.\" It's July in Orlando, it's 100 degrees and 100% humidity and I wasn't about to walk 10 minutes to the next hotel. So I asked for the bell captain; he handled it flawlessly and got us there easily and quickly. It's a great lesson in empowerment for their associates. We arrive at the Ritz-Carlton and the welcome is perfect, truly could not be any better. Associates decended upon us to take our bags, welcome us, offer champagne, and usher us to the front desk - outstanding welcome experience. The check-in was swift and pleasant and the 5 diamond service levels were adhered to perfectly. The rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed with all of the amenities one would expect. Balconies are comfortable. I had a disgusting experience with the shower cleanliness that unfortunately when unresolved for two days and three conversations with the front desk, including management. I finally cleaned the shower myself and had a face-to face meeting with the front desk manager, who apolgized profusely and offered compensation. I refused (not what I'm about) and asked that they just ensure my shower stayed clean the remainder of stay. It was. At one point, I returned to my guest room while it was being serviced by the housekeeper. She adhered well to the security protocol and made sure my key worked in the door before allowing me into the room. Great training from that angle. We entertained some clients at the Ritz-Carlton pool one afternoon and the staff there did an outstanding job. Jamie Lee is a great server and is to be commended. The pool attendant (name escapes me - young guy) also was very accommodating to our guests. We had lunch in the outdoor restaurant and the server was well trained, friendly and attentive. The bartender went out of his way and provided 5 diamond service. We also had the opportunity to eat at the Golf Club restaurant and again, the server was engaging, personable and provided a great dining experience.

The room price was the same as at the JW Marriott, which is literally right next door. The value you get from the Ritz far surpasses any other hotel. One point to note, though, is that everything is more expensive at the Ritz. So if you are staying with a family, it may be cost-prohibitive to stay at the Ritz. We discovered this when our bill for lunch at the pool- one (delicious) Cuban sandwich and a bottle of white wine came to $90.00! We used our AAA membership to get a great price on the room. The package also included complimentary valet, free breakfast and a $25 resort credit. Our room was spacious and impecably clean. The only slight annoyance was the numerous calls and knocks at the door when we checked in to make sure everything was up to par. (we were contacted 3 times in the first hour of being there..a little overkill) Otherwise we absolutely enjoyed our stay. The grounds are beautiful and immaculate. There is a great running trail around the two hotel properties. The pool at the Ritz was beautiful and the staff at the pool and everywhere else were so courteous.

In this case, however,the \"upscale\" Ritz/Marriott organization has both mis-utilized my credit card, thrown multiple roadblocks into what should have been a simple resolution, and when confronted with evidence of their abuse of my card, responded with additional charges to my account. I urge you with all strenuousness to avoid staying here and exposing your personal credit to these people. Following a one-night stay, I checked out of this hotel at 11:30AM on Feb 15th, providing payment to the front desk and receiving a receipt that was inclusive of all charges incurred. I cabbed to the airport and returned home. 2 days later, my credit card account showed a different amount than the one shown on the receipt, this one including an additional night's stay. I immediately contacted the Ritz, explained the situation, and received a \"we'll look into it\" response. A day later they responded with a \"your request for restitution has been denied\" citing an accounting department's review that found a guest checking out of my former room on the 16th used the TV interface to settle charges. I immediately faxxed to my contact at the Ritz a copy of my original Ritz hotel receipt, airline flight information, cab receipt, and airport food receipts, all from the 15th. I have zero tolerance for unsupported use of my credit card. My contact then suddenly professed an inability to handle these types of situations and referred me to \"customer care\". I followed up with this new contact, who professed zero knowledge of my situation (they had been provided with a reference number by my initial contact that apparently is not meaningful to anyone in the organization). With no knowledge of my situation, they requested original documentation for a second time so that they could could initiate a process which would take 30 days to resolve. In my ire, I requested the name and eMail of the General Manager of the hotel - for which i was provided an eMail address and a name that, as I later found out, does not exist. I immediately returned to my initial contact, who did two things. One, recanted on her referral to the customer care organization stating that this issue should not have gone to them, and two, forwarded an eMail from the accounting department that stated \"they would not be making restitution, but would as a certusy (sic) refund the additional room charges. It was hard to tell from the wording of the communication, but I took it on its face that a refund would ensue. This morning I received their real response. Not only did the Ritz NOT refund the additional room charges, they instead charged me for another ADDITIONAL DAY. Total cash out of pocket for me - $440. I have referred this issue to the Florida Attorney Generals Office, and will continue to pursue directly with Ritz/Marriott Hotel management in Maryland - as I believe that either site Hotel management is totally incompetent, or there is some sort of scam being run on guests that purposely throws roadblocks to discourage pursuit of recovery amounts. In the meantime, BEWARE... Do not stay here unless you plan to float the hotel for hundreds while you try to get a response to have their own errors corrected. Any customer service organization when faced with this situation would deal with this more professionally - expecting more for staying at the Ritz is only a sad commentary on how low this once well run and service oriented brand has fallen now that it has been taken over by the Marriott.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Moines, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cGreat service and a luxurious property!\u201d", "Author": "International515", "ReviewID": "UR98290948", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Ritz-Carlton in Orlando at Grande Lakes in Orlando, Florida.

Arrived to find not given lake view room to see fireworks on New Years Eve despite travel agent phoning them direct to secure it 8 months earlier when we booked. Reluctant to sort it until we called manager and told him he must do something - finally assigned room for us and room for our teenage sons but on arrival in their room they had double bed! So back to reception and 1 hour later with porter as confused as we were we got semi-desired rooms. When we arrived a young man in scruffy attire asked us if we wanted a drink of hot chocolate (don't have it - far too sweet) and we wondered who on earth he was - apparently he was the doorman yet he hadn't opened any doors for us and was not dressed as you would expect. Service was bad in this hotel but particularly bad was the breakfast which they tried to charge separately for when we had inclusive package and another daily argument needed to sort that out. The breakfast was in Vineyard restaurant and it was chaotic to put it mildly with people queueing for ages before being assigned a table. After a half hour wait we were shown to a half-laid table with only 3 chairs! The food was average to poor with every pastry soaked in cinnamon (fine if you like it but I don't). Fruit selection very poor and cheeses cut into lumps! The waiters were being moaned at all round by guests - the manager when we finally called him to our table after other people's kids were running around us as a game, was weak and disorganised and failed to direct his useless staff. The place was totally undisciplined. This breakfast chaos continued throughout the week with the staff hanging around in groups not doing things that needed to be done and simply trouble shooting the table who complained loudest. It was an absolute farce and we have had far more organised meals at the travelodge inn than here! The worse thing was it didn't improve at all over 7 days and there was nowhere else we could have gone. We had to keep checking our bill on the tv screen as they kept wrongly charging for breakfast and for their wretched car valeting (parking) fees which had to be removed constantly from our bill because we argued we shouldn't pay $26 a day for this when we would have liked to have parked our car ourselves but couldn't. The bar area was relatively small and the food the same as room service with no other choice. The weather was cold for December/Jan and the outside pools were freezing, yet shouldn't have been and not a sole went in them for the entire duration. There was NO INDOOR POOL despite our travel agent confirming there would be one and the SPA facilities were shoddy and were extra and would have cost us \u00a3100 per day for the 4 of us if we had wanted to use the smallest steam sauna room (located in the changing room)! So we did not have a swim or spa all week. There was nothing to do for the teenagers. Other people's badly behaved American kids ran around everywhere and there was a kids club for up to age 12. The New years eve ball was for over 21's only and no alchohol to under 21's anywhere in hotel. So our lot were understandably bored and fed up. The whole reception area stunk of cinnamon for the duration due to a tacky and poorly built iced full sized santa grotto taking up 3 square metres in reception. Room service was expensive with tips on top of extortionate service charges.

We used the Vineyard Grill for most of our dining and although a little pricey, the food was exceptional. The servers were also great, bring us complimentary glasses of wine and looking out for our children. They were VERY interested in making sure our 21 month old was happy at the restaurant, bringing him toys, a dvd player and so on. We didn't even have to ask or prompt them, it was over the top thoughtful. The other nights and all mornings we ordered room service and the food was amazing...you can get organic eggs, the best blueberry pancakes ever and wonderful vanilla infused belgian waffles...YUM! The staff was very friendly every time we came in and out of the hotel, greeting us. One night Santa was there and they came up and told us to have the kids meet him and they took a picture of us. The hotel was nicely decorated for the holidays and had a gigantic walk in Gingerbread house as you came in. We couldn't believe it was real, but it took over 1200 eggs to make it and had a sign telling you all about it. I didn't bother looking into the activities for the kids because usually it's for older kids, but I kicked myself one night when my husband and I walked past one of the ballrooms with two bounce houses in them. One was for boys (blue) and one was for girls (pink). Apparently, they had set up activities for the kids inside because of the cooler weather. What great thinking. The hotel itself is very beautiful and kept up quite well. We got a suite connecting to a second bedroom and had more than enough room. Housekeeping was very consistent and they even provided a little package for the kids with johnson's baby shampoos and toiletries and a little night light and such. They also provided REAL roll around cribs, not a pack and play. Our room was VERY quiet and I did not hear any neighbors. I would recommend this hotel to anyone as they seem to really care about the experience you have and again CONSISTENCY is the key at this hotel even in the busy holiday season.

When we walked up to the front door, there was nobody to open the door. That doesn't really bother me, I'm just making comparisons to other top brand hotel stays. Once inside, there was only one person behind the counter, and the check in took a very very long time. We purchased a Romance package, which included the rose petal turndown, champagne display with strawberries and chocolate, and we upgraded to the lake view. These touches were nice. On the down side, the room was a bit small, as was the bathroom. Also, the balcony affords no privacy. We found the best aspect of the hotel to be the dining at Norman's, and lounging at the massive pool. The service at the restaurant and pool were excellent. Overall, a nice hotel. However, below my expectations based on the higher price and high expectations for the Ritz-Carlton brand.", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dunedin", "Title": "\u201cExpected Much More\u201d", "Author": "3dogmombbj", "ReviewID": "UR71397934", "Content": "Hearing so much about The Ritz and their service level, amenities, etc., I expected so much more than 'average'.

A half-empty wine glass sat on the dusty tray for 2 days. Our room was never made up until well into the afternoon. Not sure if there is a lack of staff or what. But again, it's The Ritz! Thirdly, an adult pool should be standard at this type of hotel. Maybe because of my stay last year at The Breakers in West Palm I just thought The Ritz would be more on par with that hotel.

I was greeted by the bell staff with a hospitable courtesy that was comforting to encounter after a long day's flight. The staff member at the check-in desk was very welcoming and expedited the check-in process quickly and efficiently so that I could get to my room faster. I booked a Club Level Garden View Room and was then personally escorted by the shift general manager to my room and given a detailed and quick orientation en route as well. Any concerns and special requests were inquired by the manager before his departure from escorting me to my room since he could tell I was tired. He made sure an associate from housekeeping turned down my room and had a warm bath waiting for me by the time I arrived, The room was spacious with a comfortable bed, great amenities, clean shower/vanity area with every attention to detail in cleanliness cared for on a daily basis from housekeeping. The bell staff personally greeted me by name whenever I left or returned to the property for the evening and always assisted me with my chauffeur requests. I had a Swedish Massage at the Spa and the facilities were quiet, tranquil and excellent for experiencing a relaxing atmosphere. The pool was a great temperature (never too cold or hot) all day. The location is great as it is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of I-Drive (property is closer to Sea World). You saw the great views of the tourism areas of Orlando, and downtown in the far distance, while always in a serene and quiet atmosphere. Every time I stay at this Ritz-Carlton property I am always surprised at the level of detail and devotion to the overall guest experience at this property.

The Ritz-Carlton is connected to the JW Marriott by a outdoor breezeway. There were restaurants, coffee shops, gift shops, and bar areas within both complexes. Both hotel grounds were beautiful. A golf course lies behind the hotel. I walked it one morning. The natural landscape is beautiful. The pool area was very nice. Good service by pool staff and waitstaff. The water was cool, and the pool gave complimentary water. It is a little bit of a walk to the bathrooms by the pool though. The convention facilities were excellent.

Every member of staff is very approachable and very friendly and certainly knows how to treat you properly. It was lovely being welcomed back 'home' by the valet attendants each time we'd had a long day out in the hustle and bustle of Orlando. Its location on the lake is fabulous, if a little remote in terms of quickly getting to local shops or restaurants but it's fairly close to the main attractions. Facilities are excellent and you can't beat buying a croissant and coffee for breakfast from the little wagon by the bar and taking it to eat outside on the seats by the lake watching the birds and ducks. It's lovely, too, walking through the grounds and seeing the butterfly and herb gardens, as well as feeding the fish at 1pm. You could be a million miles away from Mickey & Co. Sharing facilities with the Marriott hotel next door, which is reached either by walking through the grounds or through the most magnificent interconnecting walkways is pretty good as there is a Starbucks there as well as Citron restaurant, which serves wicked burgers and awesome potato spears. Little details such as the iced lemon and tea on tap in the lobby, the supply of bottled water as you're coming in and out and the fast check-out also help to make it a superb customer experience. A couple of things you may find useful to know are that it's valet parking only here, which can be a bit restricting if you're just popping back for something before going out again and also a little costly.

I was very impressed with the nice-sized gym that had plenty of machines, each with its' own TV, and they had a studio where they taught beginner's ballet. I was very impressed. The spa was lush and relaxing, and I had a prenatal massage there. I highly suggest taking advantage of it, especially the prenatal massage, as the spa uses Mamma Mio products, and you will be hooked. (The only problem was my masseuse would not stop talking and bossing me around about being pregnant and a mother - what is it with people having to give you their every opinion about having a child?)

(Approximately $65 for two for a basic breakfast; $25 for one drink at the noisy, crowded bar.) Check-in, Housekeeping and room service staff were ideal- discrete, quiet & polite. I was dismayed that the only parking option was valet (an additional 21/night) and no matter how long in advance I called for my car, it was NEVER waiting for me, I always had to wait for it. I'd stay here again, but only if I need to be in close proximity to the location or for a little escape.

It is nestled away on a property that is shared by a large Marriott (that I believe is under the same owner) and is surrounded by a golf course. My wife and I stayed here with a few friends for a Thanksgiving trip to Disney World. Perhaps it was due to the holiday or it being fall, but the hotel was largely empty, which was great for us. But only after a few days here did we start to notice a lot of little annoying things that add up over time. The one hot tub is attached to a fountain. Cool idea sure, but the problem is it sprays out cold water which causes splashing onto the parts of you that are not submerged. It quickly made sense to me why it was empty when we got there. The hotel was not built too long ago, but it certainly has some signs of aging. The grout in the bathroom was clearly cleaned, but had aged and was cracking extensively. A couple pieces of the marble flooring were cracked as well. The shower was about average for a 3* hotel, but a bit below par for the image that Ritz tries to portray. I think they just simply need a refurbishment, and we were at the end of the cycle. Parking is expensive at the Orlando Ritz, which is surprising seeing as how much land they have. Its only about $5 more a day to do unlimited Valet, so I went with that instead. Also expect to pay for internet access. The location is great. Many people I know stay at the Disney hotels, but I feel you can get a lot more for less money by just driving 10 minutes each way. You are also not restricted to the highly overpriced meals at the Disney restaurants. The Ritz being surrounded by a golf course allows you to relax and not see cars whizzing by all the time, yet its a very short drive to the interstate. Overall, its not a bad location. Consider it more of a 4* hotel and you will be happier. On that note, don't pay anything more than $200 a night for their lower level rooms.

Each visit past the front desk was a chance for the girls to have a cup of ice cream, and everyone was quite tolerant of the kids in this very adult establishment. The highlights of this property for us was the pool, more specifically the pool this hotel shares with its sister resort next door, the JW Marriott. It was a paradise for the kids, and they would have stayed there all day if left to their own devices. Owing to the very slow time of year for tourists, it was relatively deserted, and we found no need to shell out for the rental of tubes to float on the lazy river. The golf course looked very inviting, and the entire property was impeccably maintained. We got a nice tour of the property after a guided kayak tour, which was fun. Note to families traveling with youngsters: some of the restaurants in both of these hotels are talked up by hotel staff to be casual and family-friendly, but I would suggest for breakfast or brunch only; older patrons/romantic couples were definitely not amused by our kids, no matter how well-behaved.

We respect their need to find ways to navigate this difficult economy, but the British guests who infected the hotel during our stay from Smith & Nephew were outright rude and obnoxious. Examples include leaving broken champagne bottles in the elevator and loud partying outside of our room at 3:00 a.m. We found it challenging to find ways to occupy our time in Orlando without good weather. The hotel wasn't much help when we asked the concierge for ideas. Our last night there we asked the concierge for a wine bar idea and she came up with Capital Grille because they have a good wine list. I responded we want more of a Tapas style restaurant. She responded by recommending Rachel's, which we later learned was a Topless style restaurant ! Another frustration is the business center, which the Ritz claims is not run by them. We had to pay about $15 for computer use when we wanted to change our return flight. At the Holiday Inn Express customers can use a PC without charge ! When we checked out we were asked how we liked our stay, to which we politely replied that the accomodations were fine but the overall stay was not all that great due to the weather. The two young ladies asked us where we were from, and upon learning it was Cleveland, Ohio they sarcastically asked us if the weather was any better in Cleveland !

There were a number of families and all the kids seemed to be having a good time too. It was Labor Day weekend and the staff had activities planned at the pool and in the kids area. We hadn't considered it before, but will certainly have this hotel on the list for our next trip with the children. Only negatives or insight - if you're looking for a child free trip you might want to go to the pool at the spa which is adults only.

My other problem with the hotel was extra charges we booked this hotel because it had a kids club but we didn't know they would charge for it ,it was about $10 per hour per child plus they then charged for material for arts and crafts like paints and canvas's: all in all too expensive. I have never been charged for kids club before but maybe they are just free in Europe I am not sure. We ate in the hotel every night which was expensive but easy as we were at theme parks most days and there are not restaurants with in walking distance we thought the food got a bit boring. We ended up having a hefty bill at the end of our 2 week stay the final insult was to be charged $21 a day for parking our car , I can understand this if its a city hotel and space is limited but as it isn't this seemed unjustified. We would not have been surprised to see a charge for the view! We stayed at Disney in Febuary and when we come back to Orlando again will stay there. This is a good hotel for couples but not for young kids especially the problem with balconies. We can't fault the cleanliness of the hotel and the courtesy of the staff , some of them really went out their way to look after us particularly the pool staff and house keeping , We feel the manager treated us unprofessionally and made us feel unwelcome and under valued.

We feel that it was worth every penny and we would recommend spending the extra if you are celebrating a special occasion. The club level rooms are not any larger than the regular rooms. The club level is on the 14th floor and the views from the lounge are beautiful. The staff in the lounge is very accommodating. The food is great. Breakfast consists of eggs, oatmeal, cheeses, bagels, pastries etc.. Plenty of food for a hearty breakfast. You can help yourself to coffee, tea and they have a great espresso, cappuccino machine. Lunch is served from 12-2. The wine and champagne comes out around noon and you can have as much as you want. They also serve beer and mixed drinks which the staff will bring to your table. Lunch is great sandwiches and salads. Light offerings are served from 5-8 and dessert from 8-10 with cordials. If you choose to, you can sit in this lounge all day and night and just eat and drink. You feel relaxed and pampered. We only had one complaint about this lounge. One night hotel guests brought in friends of theirs who were staying at the JW Marriott which is right next door. They were a very large party with many young children. The kids were out of control and very noisy. We couldn't even check our email. They were spread out all over the floor playing games etc... We left because we couldn't take it. It seems that anything goes at this place because the staff doesn't want to offend any of the guests. Well what about the guests who don't have unruly kids who are bothering others? The pool is gorgeous and it wasn't crowded at all. The guests from the JW are allowed to use this pool. Don't let anyone at the pool hog the blue floats that are free and can be used by all guests at the Ritz. People who are sitting by the pool try and take the floats and put them by their chairs even when they are not in use. I had 2 old biddies from the JW cop an attitude when I took one so that I could use it. I don't agree with their policy of allowing the JW people the use the Ritz pool but the properties are adjoining. The staff at the pool sets you up with chaise lounges with nice towels and an umbrella if you wish. They have cabanas for rent. 200 for the day, 100 for half a day. The cabana is very nice if you want to splurge. They have a fridge, a safe and a tv. We got one for the day and had a nice time. Our only complaint was that we thought the staff could have been more attentive and took things away like wet towels and garbage. A waiter came by a few times to ask if we needed anything from the bar but that was about all of the service we received. I would recommend the spa to anyone. It is huge and beautiful. I had the best massage that I ever had at this hotel. I would recommend the 80 minute signature massage. 50 minutes just isn't enough and 80 minutes is so much better. I was lucky enough to have Rick V. as my masseuse. He was very professional and wonderful. I felt like a million bucks after my massage. I would recommend him to anyone. You can call and request Rick if you would like to. Originally I had called and requested a woman. After meeting Rick, he put me at total ease and he didn't disappoint me. I would go back to this spa just to have a massage with Rick. The spa has their own private pool and you can have lunch there if you wish. Your partner can also get a spa day pass for 20 dollars if they just want to use the pool with you for the day.

I have to say I agree with most of the positive ratings but also agree w/many of the negatives. First, the property is just phenomenally beautiful. The landscaping and decor, design, flow and function of the place are superb. It is immaculately kept. If I were reviewing just these factors, it would be TEN stars. It is both luxurious and friendly, romantic and suitable for families (who know how to behave, that is...). I stayed in a deluxe room with two small children (ages 4 and 6) and found it to be very comfortable for the three of us, and one night we had local guests and slept five with a rollaway squeezed in, had in-room dining twice, and we made it work. The room is very well equipped for a business traveler and is less comfy for children- no DVD player, lots of hook ups for business equipment., teeny fridge packed to the gills with the Ritz' \"entertainment items\" (read $8 water, etc) and I was barely able to squeeze in a few things I picked up for my diet-sensitive family. Big closet, generous hangers and valets. Not enough drawers for all of us. The room was mainly prepared as I'd asked. My son is sensitive to down and I'd asked for it to be removed entirely from one bed, and it was, but they had 4 foam pillows on one bed and only two down on the other bed. Kind of odd. We all got luscious robes (ask for robes in your children's sizes and don't forget the slippers) but for some reason my housekeeper (who was NOT tipped, read on there...) refused to leave me slippers all five days we were there. As others noted the bathrooms are HUGE for hotel baths in any case. Elegant and well appointed. We did not eat at the Grill or Norman's. We ate outdoors mainly at Bleu (food, great. Service, sketchy... the first time I ate there after I had to get my own adult menus. the waiter asked how we were and I responded I'd be better if I did not have to get my own menus... hmmmm... then it took ten minutes to get the kids' menu... which BTW is the same throughout the resort. Just memorize it day one and you'll have an easier time of it). Bleu is only open mid-morning to 4:30 and I don't suggest trying it too close to closing time. Quench next door at the JW is a fine alternative... food is not as good but I found the staff. and bar staff to be friendlier and more service-oriented. I could care less how polite you are so long as I get my food, as ordered, and provide me with prompt and efficient service. Omne not so great experience was followed with one that was just great so I'd call it hit or miss. Complaints about pool service are warranted. There was generally one person on staff for the entire pool... for towels, chair set up, refreshments, spontaneous fun stuff they include for kids/families like S'mores at the firepit near the pool, etc... so Glen who we saw most (and was GREAT!) had to tapdance quite a bit and I heard people grumbling about him, but he is only one person spread thin. The pool itself and seating, great. Towels soft and warm if you don't mind getting them yourself. The lazy river next door was great and while the floaties are overpriced for us it was worth the $14 to have them pre-blown up and my kids loved that we wrote all over them and we brought them home with us. The pool at the Ritz is not deep and just fine for the kids. They have nice adult size foam floats, big fountain spray was fun for them. We booked on the kids-free program and it was well worth it. In fact we paid less overall. including food here at the Ritz than we did for Concierge-level service at a luxury Disney resort and I think the kids liked it just as much. Now other service... the valets do a poor job of handling busy times and provide complete service. For the daily cost plus tips (still worth it if you will be in and out a lot, otherwise park with \"the peasants\" as a guest said...) I timed it so that I wasn't in or out at peak times, mostly, but that should not matter in a five star, ever. The bell staff mainly held the main central doors open. I did not find them particularly helpful other than taking bags to/from the room. Unlike others I did not find it took too long to get the car but I made a point of calling down for it ten minutes in advance. I did have a maintenance issues that went unresolved that was quite annoying. The bathroom (lovely. well equipped. gross mouthwash tastes like the shower gel which does smell great... but lay off if you have sensitive skin as it is drying as other reviewers noted) water pressure is awesome and the showerhead feels like acupuncture, in a good way. However- that same pressure made the toilet that has (I say has., sure it still does) a slow leak the NOISIEST toilet in the UNIVERSE. No kidding, the re-fill on it woke me up at night with the AutoMystery Flushing. It would slowly leak just enough to flush itself and refill. I could not hear the leaking. I COULD hear the toilet refilling.Not just a little. I mean it sounded like a water cannon blasting the porcelain top tank. It was so bad my last night there I went to the bar and had two drinks (I am a lightweight) in the hope of sleeping all night and even over my snoring, it woke me. I called maintenance too many times for this issue which could have been easily resolved and was not, ever. It's a toilet, not rocket science. I did share another negative experience that others ran in to with billing. I was supposed to present a voucher everywhere for the kids eat free program. That in and of itself is a silly annoyance. It is one child per paying adult so I should have been paying for one of my two children's meals. Every time for the first three days I had an issue. I heard \"we'll fix that for you\" frequently. We got in-room service a LOT and every time I'd have to call for a correction which did not happen. It was resolved to my benefit however in response to my other issues, and all the children's meals were taken off the bill. Lastly I had an issue with housekeeping. No- a few issues. As other posters reported, sometimes you get turn down. Sometimes you don't. There was a glass in my bathroom that had a black icky thing in the bottom of it, so I put it at the edge of the counter to see if it would be washed the next day. It was not. Same thing the next day. And the next day. And the next day. The first day the coffee bar was not completely refreshed and since I'm a caffeine head, this was an issue. The maid took a soaked floor mat (still a mystery how it got that way...) and moved it instead of replacing it with a fresh one. The maids at Disney were more thorough and thoughtful. It was not all bad by any means and in general we enjoyed many things about the property. Rent one of the Italian bikes and drive around the properties! There are bunnies everywhere that are not afraid and my kids loved that. Try to time it so there are no weddings to interrupt... and a lovely place for a weddind it is. Inm fact I'd say it's a better business property than anything else. Many locals visit the restaurants and the lobby bar which is very nice.The chef's garden and butterfly garden were delightful for my children. The children's play area was safe and fun for them. You will not be served food there from the outdoor grill but you CAN get room service there. Go figure. Gratuities are included. Good if the service warrants it and I'd say it's up to you to be sure that you get your money's worth there. I found the meals there no pricier than at the Marriott and the Angus burgers were excellent. Breakfast was ok. Pastries - the danishes good, everything else just ok. Skip the bagels. The tomato basil flatbread at Bleu was huge and could feed two In all the annoyances were **not** a deal-killer, but they do not at all equate to 5-star service. 5-star property with maybe 3.5 service at best.

I am so glad we did. We stayed between the 10th and 17th of May 2009. It is a hotel which is about 15 minutes drive from the Disney Parks. What a fantastic hotel! The hotel is very beautiful and opulent. It has ample staff working there, 4 people to open the door for us and wish us a good day when leaving and entering! We had a hire car and used their valet parking facility $20 for the day plus tips. They were very friendly and always asked if we needed directions. Always gave bottles of water and helped with the luggage. You can be cheeky and just park in the Marriott car park but we didn't. The rooms are really nice and big. Separate shower from the bath which is a nice touch. Tea and coffee making facilities, iron and ironing board. The rollaway bed was $15 a night and well worth it as we needed a good night sleep after the parks. The balcony was lovely as was the pool view. I didn't let the kids on the balcony on their own and I didn't think it was too safe (4 and 1 year old). The breakfast was a buffet for $50 a day 2 adults including children (kids eat free). Alot of variety and it was very tasty. My daughter couldn't get enough pancakes and maple syrup! If you can sit outside for breakfast it had such a nice view and not many people out there. The Ritz has 2 pools, the kids pool is quite nice with a adventure frame to play on and the main pool is great with an adjoining whirl pool. It wasn't too busy and the staff again were only too happy to lay some towels out for us with a sun shade. Just a 2 minute walk to the Marriott hotel means you can use their lazy river pool which was very nice too. Although alot of leafs and bits were in it. You have to buy a rubber ring for about $5 but it means you can keep it. We decided to leave ours as bringing back to the UK wasn't a sensible option! The Marriott also has a kids pool, volleyball court in sand and a pool table which are all again very good. Back at the Ritz we hired a bike for $20 and rode around the grounds in the midday heat which wasn't a sensible thing to do but great fun! I have to warn you it gets tiring after 5 minutes but the views are lovely of the lake and golf course. Lunch was always in the bar by the pool and it was just delicious, we had the beef burgers always! The chocolate mousse's and shakes went down very well with the kids and us. The Ritz has a spa facilitty in the grounds which is just amazing. That again is highly recommended. High speed internet was $10 for the day, it's all wireless so you can surf from anywhere. Checking out has to be done by 11:00am but our flight was at 6:00pm so they allowed us to check out late at 3:00pm.

The pool area was relaxing with beautiful scenery. The amenities such as the spa and fitness center - fabulous. The lighted pathway to The JW Marriott - the adjoining hotel is lovely. The \"Lazy River\" pool at the Marriott was great - (JW Marriott owns The Ritz Carlton). At The Ritz, we ate at \"Bleu\" - the pool side restaurant, The Lobby restaurant and The Vineyard Grill. Each had good choices on the menu and required \"resort casual\" attire which worked well for families. We did not eat at Norman's but the reviews are excellent. The children's menu had good healthy choices for the main course and sides which allowed several combinations with good portion size. You require a car to do any travel to the theme parks and the hotel requires valet service which costs $20/day +tips. This might be a turn off, but it is actually quite nice and is really what you would expect at a hotel of this quality.

Yes, they do auto-charge your room if you bring a car with their valet parking of $20/day. We knew that up front because of Tripadvisor. Checkin was easy. Upon arrival, they gave us a \"best-view\" room looking over the pool and golf course. Room is spacious. Bathroom includes double sink, separate room with toilet. There is a bath tub, as well as a shower - which is nice to not have to climb into a bathtub to take a shower. Nice flat screen TV. I would return just for the spa experience. We chose the couple's massage - cost more than a night's stay at the room, but we got a day within the spa - including sauna, steamroom, indoor jacuzzi (sorry, not co-ed). Also, you get access to the private out-door pool and jacuzzi to share w/ my husband. There are also \"calming\" rooms with fruit, teas, cushy recliners, blankets. When you arrive, they give you a robe and slippers to were. My husband cracked up when I told him that on the female side (sauna, steam room, indoor jacuzzi) all the women wore bathing suits.

The pools were clean and looked like they would be a lot of fun but while i was there the weather was cold so I did not use them. The hotel staff was awesome. They clean your room a couple of times a day and keep things fresh. When I was looking for the closest bathroom while walking around the hotel I asked one of the staff and they walked me directly to it. They didnt just give directions, they actually took me straight there! ALL staff was extremely friendly. The rooms were very comfortable and i had a balcony off of my room that overlooked the \"lakes\". Not really lakes but ponds, however, gorgeous! The hotel was decorated for Christmas and had quite the display of gingerbread houses out. The food I cannot comment on. It was SOOOOOO expensive I could not fathom eating there. A peanut butter and jelly sandwich was about $12.00. Instead we took our rental car off of the property and ate on the economy. I did not see a whole lot of children there, but I noticed that they had a special sign in book for them at the registration desk and they also had some type of club that you could join them up in for playing games, swimming, etc....there just wasnt a whole lot of activities going on at the time I was there due to school not being out for the holiday yet. But if you want to take your kids, MOST DEFINITELY do so. I am sure that the staff will be VERY accomodating. There was a full bar and snack bar as well in my room. Though quite expensive. A bottle of beer was about $5.00 and you could simply go across the street off of the resort property to the PUBLIX market and buy your own much cheaper. The bathroom was heavenly. A separate shower with see thru glass doors (very large) and a separate tub. The toilet was also in a separate room by itself (with a phone as well). It was all tiled very nicely. The bath products were bvulgari and just heavenly! They had complimentary shoe shine service as well which I thought would be wonderful had my husband been staying there since he travels for business and would have partaken in that service. The beds were so awesome I did not want to get up every morning. Lots of pillows and really really wonderful mattresses. The temperature was easy to maintain in the room and you could not hear it when it would go off and on. It just maintained the temperature. The walls were thick. I never ONCE heard my neighbors and I knew the girl who was staying next to me. and she was going out till odd hours every single night drinking but I did not hear her come in not once. I would most definitely stay there again. I had a very pleasant experience. Definitely tip your housekeeper handsomely. They do a fantastic job! Check in and check out were super easy. I had actually booked my room from 7-13 December but they were overbooked for our conference so I was sent to Shingle Creek which is right down the road (ANOTHER AWESOME RESORT). But a couple of days later I moved to the Ritz and the hotel took care of it all. They sent a town car over for me and moved my luggage all the way to the room and everything. I had to do absolutely nothing. They called me and asked if I would like to be moved. I did ONLY because my conference was actually at the Ritz and it made it much more convenient to sleep there as well. Otherwise I probably would have stayed at the Rosin Shingle Creek.

The room was very nice and the bed extremely comfortable. The only thing I did not like was the Bvlgari toiletries, the scent was so heavily perfumed it made me feel a little sick to my stomach. I would strongly suggest bringing your own toiletries or you might be able to ask for different ones. We had a package that included breakfast buffet daily and a $50 resort credit. The breakfast buffet was very good but I would never have paid for it ($57 for two people was the listed value). We used the fitness area which was really nice \u2013 one of the nicer facilities I\u2019ve seen. Plus they play music that you actually want to listen to when you work out. My husband and I both had spa treatments \u2013 I had a stone pedicure ($90) and he had a signature massage ($120). I would have to say that the pedicure was not worth it and is the reason for the 4 and not 5 stars. The massage according to my husband was the best he ever had. Also it seemed to me most of the appointments were for massages so maybe that is what they do best. The spa pool was also very nice and virtually empty when we were there. I would just pay the money to access the spa and skip the treatment. We also ventured over to the JW Marriott which is next store and has a lazy river pool. We actually had to use the pool there because the pool at the Ritz closes earlier and the JW Marriott pool stays open later. The valet parking was a little annoying but we always called down and our car was always waiting for us. Most of the time they just handed us the keys and we walked over to where they had parked the car. Also my $50 resort credit was not automatically credited so I had to stop at the front desk \u2013 it was handled quickly but I always wonder why these things don\u2019t get handled automatically (I swear the first hotel that handles a resort credit with no issues will get my loyalty for life!)

The Ritz was the best, for sure. The hotel is very accommodating to children, very clean, and the staff is extremely friendly and efficient. Early check-in was no problem, with our room totally ready with a little welcome kit for our daughter, which she thought was so exciting. She carried her little Ritz bag all week. We used the concierge to make reservations at Roy's, and we received total VIP treatment at the restaurant including a cheese quesadilla for our toddler upon arrival and a free dessert for everyone. The room we had overlooked the pool, and one night there was an extremely nice fireworks show as a result of a corporate event occuring on campus. The pool is very nice, and the pool and lazy river at the adjoining JW Marriott is perfect for families. We ate at Bleu, the hotel restaurant by the pool, as well as at the Vineyard Grill in the hotel basement. Both meals were excellent. We ordered room service for one meal, and the delivery was prompt and pleasant. We enjoyed the complimentary bottled water throughout the hotel (by the pool, at the front desk, in our room), as well as the excellent lemonade next to the front desk. It is true they charge you by the day for valet parking ($20) and wireless internet ($10), but we found the valet to be very attentive.

This Grande Lakes resort complex [the JW Marriott and the Ritz] are in a strange location--in the general neighborhood of the airport expressway and International Dr. It's not far from SeaWorld, but otherwise it seems a strange choice for a place to put a resort of this size. It appears they mostly do convention business; if you're a vacation traveler, then you'll really only want to stay here if exceptional service is your highest priority. Check-in was smooth and I was able to get the room I requested at 9am, so that was a good bonus. Rooms have the typical Ritz layout, but more cheerful colors than others I've stayed at--springtime yellows and greens, with vine-print wallpaper in the bathroom. I had a good-sized balcony but did note that many rooms had smaller balconies. The rooms adjacent to the elevators have truly private, walled, larger balconies while others have smaller ones that are directly open to the neighboring rooms. Incidentally, I wouldn't bother about paying more for a view here--they're all pretty much on a par. One side overlooks the front fountains and downtown Orlando in the distance, the other side overlooks the pool, part of the golf course, and the sunset. No matter which room you're in, you'll have a \"lake view\"--the property is dotted with a bunch of little ponds. [I wouldn't call any of the lakes \"grand\", so the name Grande Lakes is a bit of a marketing ploy.] There were a couple of housekeeping issues in the room--dust on the back of the desk, a cobweb on the balcony, and a four-day-old newspaper and Cheerio under the ottoman. The linens, bathroom, and other main surfaces were spotless. Service here is top-notch, even by Ritz standards. Each area of the resort was always fully-staffed, so there was no wait for anything. Cocktail waitresses, bar staff, concierge, room servce, spa attendants--everyone was right at hand and efficient and friendly. The spa was exceptional--with a different design scheme and layout than any other I've come across. The waiting area had charcoal curved sofas with burgundy accents and looked like someone's sophisticated Manhattan apartment--very appealing. The spa pool is also a great spot to spend some quiet time. It was far less crowded than the main pool and almost as large. There are several dining options and all the ones I went to were strong--Norman's is a must, and the Fairways pub at the Golf Clubhouse makes a terrific crab and corn chowder. All the amenities of the JW next door are also available--and make a trip over to eat at Primo [separate review]. All in all, the property is very solid, just in an odd place.

The private spa area and pool were a true retreat. Despite the enjoyable spa area, we felt we had to keep \"checking\" things on our reservation-- regarding a credit we received for dining services and late checkout. We had a 4pm checkout with our Amex card, and the other couple in our party actually received a knock at their door seeing if the needed \"help with their luggage\" since check out time had already passed (it was only 2:00pm).

The OK: -Rooms are clean, nicely appointed, but much smaller than I am used to -No complimentary transportation.....for these prices they should offer a shuttle service like One and Only and Four Seasons does -Golf course is dry and just 'ok' -The view.....blah.....looks over a dried up, brown, muddy pond Hope this helps", "Date": "June 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Asheville, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cStill the Ritz, but just okay\u201d", "Author": "baxwelll", "ReviewID": "UR16611222", "Content": "I have to say I was a little disappointed with my stay because when I think Ritz, I think service, and it was lacking here.

We had an club level suite on the 14th floor, great views with a fantastic view nightly of the fireworks from epcot and Magic Kingdom even though they are 10 miles away. We had peace and quiet, total relaxation with the knowledge that the team within the hotel would do their utmost to provide you with everything you find necessary for your perfect stay. If you can, go with club level, food and drink is included and although this balances on cost it is a lot more convenient, remembering that drinks, cocktails, breakfast, lunch, and evening selections are available to the club level guest. The staff are magnificent, again my thanks to Katie, Jason, Trish and our room maid Violette. Valet parking excellent and prompt but at $20 a day is really unnecessary at this level of hotel. No other negatives. It was great to leave the hustle and bustle of disney for a 15 minute car ride to an idyllic haven recommended at families as well as executives.

As we were staying in a Ritz Carlton property and the fact the hotel is apparently 5* we obviously had certain expectactions. Upon arrival at the hotel, I was suprised that there was no one to help us with our luggage. After myself and my husband dragged our luggage in to reception I was very disappointed to learn from the less the friendly receptionist that they could not accomodate our request for a king bed.(I made this request 6 months in advance).I asked if there was any way that they could facilitate our request over the following day or two.The answer was a straight no,no apology, no compromise.Basically he said that the King rooms were on a first come first served basis and they were all taken.I was particarly annoyed when I learned from another member of our party who checked in the next day that they got a king room even though they had forgotten to request it when booking. We were brought to our room which had a fantastic view over the pool area and the golf course and got the sun in the evening. We really enjoyed having a drink on the balcony before we went out in the evenings. Rooms were nice but having stayed in many 5 star resorts in Europe and Asia I would not class them as 5*.They were very small and the 2 beds in the room which were supposed to be 2 doubles were tiny. Myself and my husband tried to sleep in one of the beds together the first night but there was no room to move so we ended up in seperate beds for the week.....not exactly a romantic start to the holiday!!(I'm only 5'3\" in height). The pool area is lovely, never a problem getting a sunbed.Plenty of water available and fresh fruit. We also availed of the pool facilities in the JW Marriott as we had family staying there.Really enjoyed the lazy river. Food: We found the food in the hotel expensive for very average food. Breakfast: We had breakfast a few mornings in the Ritz which was nice as there was an al a carte menu as well as a buffet option. We eat in bar bleu - food was nice for a snack. Eat in Quench (JW Marriott) - Food okay but again expensive.Ordered drinks by the pool from Quench bar staff one of the days, 4 cocktails cost $69....she had added an 18% gratuity for my convenience!!!!. My final negative was the service. There was a constant expectation for tips in both hotels. I never felt any service was genuine , it always felt like staff only did something for you if they thought they would get a tip.I don't agree with tipping for everything, we were staying and paying up front for a 5* hotel so I don't think you should have to tip to ensure that you get 5*service.When we were leaving the hotel no one asked us how our stay was........maybe they just don't care. Unfortunately my final memory of the hotel was as follows.. Our bags were taken down from our room to a town car which was taking us to the airport, we tipped the guy our last $10 bill.He left the bags at the car and another guy put them into the trunk of the car, I could not believe it when he stood there expecting a tip for lifting 2 suitcases into the trunk .( we had to leave him standing there as we were heading back to the land of euro and had no more $.........)", "Date": "May 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat for Orlando- Good Ritz Carlton\u201d", "Author": "roar_03", "ReviewID": "UR16166455", "Content": "I had a 3 day conference at the RC Orlando.

I had a terrace on my 3rd floor room (most rooms have balconies) It was great having it- partial views of the pool and the immaculate grounds. A couple of minor issues. The terrace looked like it had not been cleaned in a while, there was a used plastic fork on the ground and paint smudges on the chairs outside. I know how difficult it is to maintain outdoor stuff in the tropics but this is the Ritz Carlton.

We have been to the spa many times before, and they are fantastic when they get it right, but REALLY ANNOYING when they get it wrong, which seems to twenty percent of the time. Yesterday we were at the spa pool and never had a server come over to us, although a group of six women seemed to have three servers fawning over them. After chasing down a server and ordering two glasses of wine, we waited 45 minutes - no wine. Back inside to find out where the wine was, yes, the server apologized, and they gave us a bottle of wine, but, that was not the point. The group of six women seemed to be drunk, horsed around like kids in the pool, screaming and swearing. Another couple around the pool must have had enough of it, and must have called the hotel, because a 'manager-type' came up to us and asked if we called the hotel. It wasn't us, but someone came out and spoke to the group of women. Later, as we sat in the outdoor hot tub, two of the group got back in the pool and started squealing, when one of their group told them to hush, one in the pool said \"[--] them, I'll make noise if I want to\". One of this group was also smoking all afternoon. This is a non-smoking area, but evidently the spa personnel does not seem to want to enforce a 'spa-like atmosphere' when it comes to groups of women. I tried to overlook all of this, until, someone from the spa came out and asked me to move over to the side of the spa pool where this group was, since there was a private event going to occur at the pool and they were closing the area I was sitting in. I didn't want to sit down wind of the smoking, swearing party girls, so I just left. Even a call to the General Manager of the Ritz, did not really get us anywhere. We have been regular visitors of the Spa at The Ritz, but are hesitant to go back again. The personnel in the Men's locker room are evidently incredible, but the women's side is just lousy.

As previous reviewers have noted, the hotel uses an outside company that supplies town cars for transportation. We attempted to pre book our arrival pick up and departure on line - and it was bungled at every turn. It is too long to relate all the negatives with this (and I am sure most would not believe all the things that went wrong) - but my first piece of advice - pick up the phone and call the concierge if you are trying to arrange something; and even then be prepared to never quite get what you think you are getting when using the concierge or the car service. The next negative was the description online vs the actual room we received. We booked club level, lake front, king room (609 USD for March spring break). Here is my second piece of advice - make sure you get what you pay for. For example if you really want to be on the same floor as the club lounge - not the floor below (so that you don't have to navigate either a stairway or elevator to bring your loved one a glass of wine back to the room) - then specify that is what you want. Club lounge is on the 14th floor (actually the 13th), our room was down on the 12th. \"Lakefront\" also does not capture what we received. True - our room did face towards the lake, but the view was decided \"Lakeview\" (a difference of $30 USD per night). This brings us to the \"last straw\". The first morning, we had found the duvet on the bed too heavy for our taste and asked house keeping to bring us a blanket we could substitute for the next evening. They delivered a tattered and worn out blanket that looked more appropriate to be spread over the back seat of the car for your dog to jump on after a swim in the lake. This brings me to my last piece of advice - complain. I took the blanket downstairs with me and asked to speak to the on duty manager. We had a brief discussion of my disappointments and he offered to reduce the rate of the room to the regular rate of $459. With only two small caveats (more on these later) - the general trend of our stay started to alter course. So lets review the positives. The hotel itself is very nicely done, very grand and well laid out. (Indeed my wife and I can't remember ever being in a hotel that had such grand public washrooms - we even snuck into each other's to see the mosaics and furnishings). The spa fitness building and it's associated private pool deserve special mention. The gym is extremely well equipped and very clean. The men's and ladies private rooms were spectacular - with saunas, whirlpools, private waiting rooms. The general waiting area is one of the most remarkable spa rooms I have even been in (the website features a picture that only hints at it's charms). The pool area (which unless you have a treatment booked for the day is 20 USD) is peaceful and serene - adults only. This complex alone is worth a positive review. The hotel staff are extremely well trained and seem genuinely happy to serve. The grounds are beautiful and the entire property was well cared for. The club lounge is especially remarkable in the food that they present. I am quite prepared to believe that some club level guests who never purchase any food while on the property. If so they are missing out. We ate in three of the properties restaurants. Primo's for our second evening (its over at the sister hotel - the Marriott), Bleu (the casual restaurant near the pool) for lunch, and finally Norman's for our final night. All of these did an fabulous job and both me and my wife highly recommend them. (I note a previous reviewer did not like the service at Norman's - our experience with our waiter was completely the opposite - he was very helpful and very professional). In conclusion - the Ritz Carlton is a big luxury hotel with some very nice amenities, great food, and willing staff. If you are looking as we were, for 3 days of relaxation in the central Florida area, we would recommend this luxury choice. But be forewarned, it is a big hotel - with all the problems that 'big' can bring. The last two issues? When I went to check out, the rate had been adjusted for only 2 of the promised 3 nights, and the blankets - the second set that were delivered - even after the complaint to the Manager - were for twin beds!", "Date": "March 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cComfortable and classy.

We heard great things about the Ritz in Orlando and decided last minute to stay there on our way back home from Ft. Lauderdale. As always, the service was impeccable. Everyone was extremely helpful and nice. I can't say enough about the front desk staff! The hotel was gorgeous, as expected. We had a lake view and it was very pretty (we were on the 5th floor). The room itself looked about the same as our room in Maui, so I assume all Ritz rooms are nearly identical. The only difference I noticed was that the Ritz in Orlando did not have a tub/shower AND a standing shower - it only had a tub and a standing shower. Not a big deal - more than more hotels. But I had liked that in Maui my husband and I could get ready at the same time. The bed is the most comfortable bed I've ever stayed in. My lower back hurts a lot in hotel beds. We had just gotten done staying at a wonderful Marriott resort in Ft. Lauderdale, but my back had even started to hurt there. I had no back trouble at all with the Rtiz bed - I wish I could bring the mattress home with me! We had room service for dinner and breakfast, so I can't speak to the restaurants on site. But the room service was great; very tasty. It was highly priced, but room service always is. The grounds looked nice. We got in late and didnt' have time to enjoy most of the amenities, but the pool looked nice. Plus, there were hammocks throughout the grounds, boats to rent, bikes, boce ball, etc. The spa is shared with the Marriott, which also looked nice. However, I was more impressed with the pool (and grounds in general) at the Ritz in Maui. The hotel is somewhat in the middle of nowhere and since it is a resort, it can sustain itself. But, if you're looking to be close to attractions, this is not the place to stay. It also annoyed me that you have to pay for parking. The hotel is not in the middle of the city where parking is limited and the hotel has to be pay the city for parking spots (like in big cities I've been to, such as Seattle). So they charge you $20 + tax a day for parking and do they really need to??? No - they are in the middle of nowhere - tons of parking availabiliy. It's just another way to make money. And with the rooms being as expensive as they are, I wish they could just let you have free parking! Also, there didn't seem to be a restaurant on site that was inexpensive - everything was pretty pricey. Overall, I loved my stay at the Ritz. The people were fantastic and the beds and room service were great. I LOVE Ritz Carltons in general and was not disappointed here. While I was highly happy with my stay, I have to say that I think the Ritz in Maui is hands above this one.

We never wanted for anything and were treated at all times, by all hotel personnel with the utmost respect and attention. The property itself is beautiful. At first, I thought that sharing the property with the Marriott was unfortunate, but sharing facilities actually allows each hotel to offer a continguous and beautifully manicured outdoor lawn and pool area. It also has resulted in a spectacular spa. We took the golf and spa package. The Norman course was attractive to me because it has no buildings on it. While it's not the most dramatic or challenging course, it is very well kept. For 2 days, I had the course and the impressive practice area to myself (literally, it's not as busy during this down season). You are assigned a caddie for the entire round and it ends up being an 18 hole lesson. Ask for Caddie Nick, a good guy who provides solid instruction. I've played many better courses, but I've had few golf experiences that were as pleasant. There were a few drawbacks that, in fairness, might affect someone more sensitive. While the food on the patio is excellent (and accompanied by great service), there is the typical price gouging you'll see at a 5 star resort. I'm not sure if this is a seasonal thing, but it also seemed as if the Ritz was punting some of its facilities to the Marriott. The Ritz outdoor jacuzzi was cooler than desirable, and the otherwise stunning, \"heated\" pool was ... not so much. Again, could be a seasonal thing during a down time.

My 11 and 12 year olds went missing and I found them playing games with the staff. They also get free ice cream at with a wrist band they get at the pool. The service is great and as you leave for a park they give you water bottles. A great breakfast was included with our room, which was perfect before spending the day in Orlando. The only bad thing about the Ritz is that the rooms were uncomfortable for a family, beds were small and rooms were small, but it was okay because the staff and service was fantastic.

The pricing was about the same as the Ritz-Carlton Key Biscayne, sky-high, so we expected similar levels of service.

Valet parking was available at $28 per day, but obviously, the parking lot wasnt paved, as the car arrived dusty and dirty every morning. The rooms were ok-ish, but: again, the Ritz Carlton bathroom doors look more like closet blinds than doors. The TV set was old and the picture quality very poor. The pool was rather small, too cold and dirty. But the most annoying thing was a high-pitched, screeching noise that was interrupting the silence anywhere on the property every ten seconds or so, it made it hard to sleep at night. We attributed it to some screechy AC on the roof, and we had housekeeping check into the noise several times - all to no avail. Then, during the second week of our stay, some engineer figured that this noise was designed to be there to get rid of the birds !

There was the kids' room with a full bath, the living area with a half bath and wet bar area, then the master bedroom with a king bed and an oversized bathroom that included a bath, separate LARGE shower and makeup/vanity area. Amenities were top of the line. 7/19 was my husband's birthday and we are Ritz loyalists. They sent up a bottle of superb champagne with a beautifully decorated plate of cookies and chocolates. What a wonderful touch! The kids also received one of the kids' bags with cameras, wrist bands (for the free unlimited ice cream!) and a few other goodies. The Ritz pool is great for relaxation, but the Marriott pool is more fun for kids with the lazy river and tubes. We enjoyed both pools and highly recommend them! The spa at Grand Lakes is nicely done as well. We did not have any services, but used the gym every day. It is a fair size with Precor equipment and free weights. There are plenty of cold towels and drinking water and headphones available. We ate at the Vineyard Grille for breakfast each day and were greeted with enthusiasm and smiles by all. We were fortunate enough to have our same waitress almost every day of our stay which was a plus as she remembered all our preferences. The buffet chef was phenomenal and quite personable. The food was good, not outstanding. But, remember we only had breakfast there! The hotel itself is gorgeous and connects to the Marriott through the convention area.

You will see the difference at the pool whereas the Ritz isn't as busy and people laying out reading, whereas the Marriott you have lots more kids, interaction in the pool, fun times.

She was very business-like, and we really didn't get the impression she had any interest in anything other than getting us away from the desk in spite of our pleasant acceptance of our room assignment! We were checking in early so can't imagine how \"all king rooms were taken\", but . . . We were told we would be \"compensated\" by being upgraded to a room with a view. This upgrade turned out to be a fifth floor room over children's pool and restaurant with distant view of piece of golf course. Bottled water was handed out to guests checking in by a man who was the only one with a sincere smile! The room was nice enough but nothing special especially for the rate we were paying per night (in excess of $325 with tax). Ice was not offered to us. There was a small balconey which had a table and two chairs covered with bird poop! It was not cleaned during our stay. We had a need to call housekeeping for an issue, and the woman on the phone was lovely and assured us someone would be right up. A half hour later, housekeeping came to the door to see if we'd been taken care of. When we said no, she said, \"Oh, OK . . . I'll do it right now\". I believe she was the person originally asked to come and had just taken longer than necessary so was covering her delay. The hotel is not convenient to any shopping or attractions, but they do offer a shuttle to Universal and Sea World. When we spoke with the concierge about this service, we were told the shuttle had already left for the day. We asked about other transportation, and he said a car to take us to the malls was $25 each way, and the price to be driven to the Disney parks was $30-40 each way. These prices did not include the necessary gratuities. When we did not jump at the offer to book a car, he had no further interest in helping us with any other suggestions. We should have inquired about cabs; there were none outside. We did have a fantastic dinner in The Vineyard with Michael as our superb waiter. The Caesar salad was excellent, soup was fantastic, and the wine list, albeit expensive, was top notch. Wonderful experience in this restaurant and definitely best part of our stay at the Ritz. We actually cut our trip short and left this hotel to stay elsewhere (Ginn Resort in Reunion), and it was the second best part of our Ritz experience.

My best regards go out to the management of this hotel as this property is a shining star in every respect. I traveled to Grande Lakes accompanied by my family to attend a conference held jointly and the Ritz-Carlton and the adjoining JW Marriott. From check-in to check-out, every aspect of my Ritz Carlton experience was flawless and most enjoyable. My children really enjoyed the Kid's Check-In that allowed them to register while sipping complementary lemonade as well as being presented with wristbands that could be shown at any hotel eatery to get free ice cream. The room and bathroom were absolutely spotless and well maintained as were all common areas. The pool was lovely and uncrowded even though the hotel was at capacity due to my conference. Perhaps another reason for the uncrowded pool was that Ritz Carlton guests could use the incredible pool facility at the adjacent JW Marriott. The Marriott has a great pool with a fun lazy river to be sure and is only about a one minute stroll from the Ritz pool. Lots of different pool \"areas\" at the Marriott allow for a very uncrowded environment. Poolside expenses at the Marriott pool may be conveniently charged to your room at the Ritz. After staying at the Ritz/Marriott complex, I found myself wondering why someone would stay at an overpriced Disney resort when this complex is by far grander than any Disney property I have visited and is only a 10-15 minute drive away. Food at the Ritz was top-shelf indeed. Upon arrival, we had a late dinner at the Ritz's casual dining restaurant and were very impressed. I had an incredible porterhouse steak and my wife had a lobster salad that was the best I have ever tasted. My family ate one luch poolside at the Ritz and enjoyed it very much. We did not use room service during our visit. I attended a private luncheon related to my conference at the Ritz and was really impressed with the food, especially after experiencing the conference lunches served at the JW Marriott which were almost uneatable.

Anyway I digress...upon driving up you are greeted with a panther fountain (perhaps a nod to Florida's panthers?) and a choice to go to the JW Marriott or Ritz. Pulling in valet rushed over, took our car, and had a bellman whisk away our luggage. Scented cold towels and bottled water? Check. Woman checking us in with a heavy accent? Check but whatever. Next something unusual, a manager of sorts escorts us with our room keys over to our room. Nice touch, personal service evident. After he leaves bellhop arrives, notices our bottle of wine we purchased on the way over and calls up room service for a chiller, another nice touch. Amazing balcony, oversized room, incredible shower. Next we decide to head over to the pool...get our towels at the cabana poolside but are offered by an attendant to \"set us up\" sure thing. We scout out the pefect spot, he places three towels per chair, tip him for his efforts. Ended up spending the entire afternoon here, and yes the attendants come by with all kinds of goodies: pineapple slices, smoothie samples, cold towels, Dippin Dots, snow cones, etc. Ordered a snack from Bleu, the pool bar...lobster quesadillas were outstanding. Always called down to valet 5-10 minutes so they'd have our car ready, exceptional. Live steel drum music on a Saturday afternoon was pure paradise. Missed it on Sunday. Ate at the Vineyard Grill...not too impressed. Heard Norman's wasn't worth checking out so didn't bother. Did have tea in the lobby lounge, which btw the lounge at this Ritz is way too noisy and yes lots of conventioners with their crackberries sort of killing the vacationing mode I was in but I'd rather see them than kids running barefoot through the lobby of a 5 star hotel. Improvements? Really nothing, except not allow so much abuse from guests of the JW Marriott next door to use the Ritz's pool, it was evident in the louder guests by their bathrobes emblazoned with the winged lion logo. This Ritz is probably the most outstanding hotel in Orlando. By no means should you consider a deluxe Disney resort if your ok with spending this kind of money, the service continues to decline and service is no where near as personal, the extras aren't there and if they are Disney nickels and dimes you to death, and you end up paying even more than the Ritz. P.S. I read a couple of the negative reviews about this place but realized they were few and far between. The comment about \"being swarmed with bugs\" is in fact true...if you consider love bugs a pest (when in fact they are not).

The food was excellent wherever we ate-- My only complaint was the spa. I went there 2 different days and both days the waiting area was taken over by large and very loud groups of women. Other spas I have visited have signs designating some rooms as \"Quiet rooms\"--sad that people should have to be told to keep their voices down, but apparently it needs to be spelled out for some people. There were several weddings while we were there and the members of the wedding party, not hotel guests, brought huge suitcases full of clothes and makeup and took over the locker rooms, shower area, etc. Again, a spa of this size should designate one locker room to groups so that the rest of the guests can enjoy a little peace and quiet...

You need to know that is is not at all adjoining the Disney parks and is in fact quite a drive if that is what you are looking for. Just as it is removed, you will not find any association to Disney nearby. No mouse ears or theams anywhere. Also, the site was created from the ground up which is good and bad. Good in the sense that they could create everything from scratch, bad in that it is removed. Again, much like what Disney did. Transportation: Before I go too far I need to point out transportation. If you are like me and staying mostly onsite for business, you will NOT rent a car. No rentals are on-site at the airport so you need to take the dreaded bus. My taxi ride from a stand at the airport was $45 with tip. My ride back from the Ritz in one of the many Limo's they always have standing by was $47 with tip. If you are staying at the hotel, have them arrange for your arrival at the airport. Service and Quality: Classic Ritz. When I checked in even though it was not a terribly warm day I was offered a cool towell and iced lemonade during checkin. I had two people assisting me throughout the checkin process. I did have a special rate at $229 per night. I've been at Ritz Carlton quite a few times before at both MUCH higher rates and even at lower rates and the service is consistenet. Room: I found the room to be exactly what you would expect from this hotel. The bathroom was huge with a seperate shower and tub, a digital scale, and Bulgari shampoos, condiditioners, and lotions everywhere, which is a big plus. Two months later and I am still using the lotions. All doors were solid wood, closet lights turned on when opened, and the entire room had a fresh rose potpourri scent throughout, even after I had been there several days. Not that I have a foul smell, but I could not ever figure our where this plesent scent came from. Dining: When I first checked in it was evening and I just ordered room service. I must say the service was excellent, and my simple Club sandwach with a Side Salad were both excellent with the service. Also the price was right (as opposed to going off site and finding McDonalds). However, another night in my stay I did dine at Norman's and was not impressed. While our service was great, this was possibly the least memorable meal I've had in this type of resturaunt. I do not even remember what I ordered and if I enjoyed it. Neither do any of my guests. We do however remember our primary server and his service. This unfortunately does not make up for our lack of rememberance of our other servers. Pools / Spa's: As stated earlier, this property was created from the ground up so the pool area is wonderful for adults. Kids might enjoy the lazy river at the JW adjoining property. I cannot comment on the spa's. Summary: This is a classic Ritz property and you will be treated with respect (Yes Sir/Mam, No Sir/Mam) and the ever peresent \"My Pleasure\" which they mean.

The amenities were great but the room itself was the size of a normal 3 star hotel. The biggest disappointment was the service; it was terrible. The first night we ate at the hotel's steak restaurant and waited at least 1 hour for them to bring the food after we ordered. Then the busboy began picking up my food before I even finished. The waiter did not come around to ask if everything was okay. It was also nearly impossible to get service at tables in the bar area. We had to get up and get drinks at the bar twice although there were waitresses. Unfortunately the staff has no sense of urgency about serving guest or trying to please guests. The service is comparable to that of a Caribbean Island. I also played golf on their course and it was okay. The course was not worth the amount they charged.

We loved the Ritz. It's hard to imagine staying anywhere else. First, we were able to stay at the club level because my husband had accumulated points through his business purchases. When we arrived at check in, someone was there to offer us cider and towels to wipe our hands. It was just great, as we had just come from the airport, it was late at night and we were tired. Then, when we got up to our club level room, we were very courteously shown the amenities and the concierges offered us milk and cookies. The club level was fabulous--a quiet place to rest, with 5 different food presentations every day. The only downside to the club level is that I don't know if there are suites. We stayed in a standard size room which was tough with a 2 year old. A little more space would have been great. After 3 days we were moved to a suite of rooms off of the club floors (we had been unable to book 7 straight days at the club level) and we actually liked the regular suite of rooms better. The bathrooms were gorgeous. Room service--excellent. Housekeeping--excellent. Spa--don't miss it. Hospitality--the best. The club level food was delicious. The club level is great if you enjoy wine/cocktails, etc. I was pregnant at the time and my husband doesn't drink so it was a bit wasted on us. And I did feel a little uneasy bringing our 2 year old in there, even though he is well behaved. I think the club level is better if you have older kids. The hotel was beautifully decorated for the holidays. Every night there was a storytime with Santa for the little kids. And every day there were cooks working on a huge gingerbread house with wonderful desserts for the hotel patrons to try. The spa services were UNBELIEVABLE. The best spa I have ever visited. I think there is a massage therapist named Amy--fabulous. The private pool area for spa guests was so beautiful, I didn't want to leave it. I could ahve stayed at the spa all day. I thought the regular RC pool was terrific too. A wonderful toddler pool area for little kids. Even a playground area. The lazy river pool at the marriot next door is so much fun. A couple of problems: the second night we were there, our bathroom became soaked with a leak from the ceiling and we had to be moved at 8 at night. However, we did not get any kind of apology or reimbursement for this until we asked a few days later. Second, we never got vouchers for our breakfast meals even though they were included in the price of our room. I had to ask for those. Also, a package was delivered to our room (wasn't ours) and we had to ask someone to return it. Having said all that, of course these mistakes can happen at any hotel. My only complaint is that no apology or compensation was offered until we asked for one. But I do recommend this hotel.

Decore of room was nice but nothing in my opinion to say, \"Wow, this is really pretty and different!\". Bed was indeed very comfortable. I always review TripAdvisor prior to heading to a new location and found *one* review that noted oddly - paper thin walls. I brushed it off as over sensitivity. My experience was significantly disappointing for my very first stay at a Ritz. To give readers an idea of where I'm coming from, I've stayed at some of the finest hotels in the world along with my fair share of middle of the road \"suite style\" locations - finding tremendous value and enjoyment at *both*. My core standards might be on the high side compared to the majority of people, but I also appreciation for those suite style/extended stay locations because they are clean - comfortable - and QUIET, all for a very very reasonable price. On the flip side, I've stayed in hotels at $700+ a night to have a bathroom with window overlooking the city. And been happy to pay every dime. (I am a woman for whatever it's worth.) So back to thin walls. My first night there prior to a week long conference, my next door neighbors were two young women who rolled into the room about 12:30 a.m. and I was shocked to discover I could hear their conversation VERBATIM. Simply sitting in my room. I could hear the clanking of a darn water glass on the glass shelf in their bathroom. And yes, I could hear activities from the water closet as well. Thank heavens those nice women checked out and a new quiet conference attendee checked in the next night and from that point on I had no issue with noise - other than I did hear him snoring my last night of the week long stay. This was a major disappointment to me in that I've stayed at motor inns with thicker walls than this. I am due to return to the area for the same conference at the same time next year and I'll reserve a room at the Marriott. The price difference in no way warranted a return trip to the Ritz. However, with regard to the spa - BEAUTIFUL. I had two treatments and I can see why this spa has been voted number one in the country.

My husband was attending a conference there, and I joined him for a few days, (along with our two kids, 5 & 3 years old). From the minute we pulled up, the service was fantastic. Sure, you get what you pay for - as others have said, valet parking is required and is $15/night, plus you have to tip them every time you come and go, which can get expensive. But I'm assuming the guests that stay at a property like this on a regular basis wouldn't bat an eye at that, or at the high cost of everything here. : ) After all, it is the Ritz!! So if you come with that expectation, you truly do get the service you pay for...for example, when we left, the valet gave us four bottles of ice cold water as we departed. Loved that, especially in the Florida heat! Property - lovely. Hotel is right next to the Marriott. My son loved all the tiny lizards running across our path as we walked throughout the property (be warned if you don't like skittering reptiles - ha-ha!) Room - gorgeous. The decor was upscale, calming and beautiful...without being too over the top. Our room overlooked the fountain, the pool, a lake and a hole on the golf course - wow. Sitting on the balcony was heaven, listening to the tinkling fountain. A few downers - there wasn't a fridge...the shower, although beautiful, was a bit cramped for leg shaving, etc. But the bathtub is large, so I guess that makes up for it. Bathroom is awesome, lots of marble, with separate room for toilet. The Bulgari bath products smell divine. King bed was SO comfortable, and we loved the chaise-like chair that sat by the sliding doors. Pool - beautiful, with huge dolphin statues all around spouting water into the water. We didn't use the Ritz pool b/c we had little ones - we went over the Marriott where there is a GREAT zero depth entry shallow pool that leads into a lazy river. As a parent, it's wonderful, b/c you can hang out in slightly deeper water (3 1/2 feet) while watching your kids in the shallows. My husband and I took the kids around the lazy river over and over. Although they charge for innertubes, lots of people left them behind (purposely) when they left the pool. A few times we were offered tubes from guests that were finished with them...we took the first couple up on their offer and just held onto the tubes for the rest of our stay. Food - We only had a few meals at \"Quench\", the poolside grill at the Marriott. Food was really tasty and large portions...but a bit pricey, especially for kids meals. We didn't get out of there for under $60 each time, and we all had burgers/sandwiches (my husband would have a beer as well). My husband said the food at the conference was superb, so I can assume the same goes if you are a guest. Amenties - Great little touches, like turndown service with classical music playing and chocolates when you get back to your room. If you ask, they also provide mini robes and slippers for your kids to use...our kids were a riot, slipping into their luxurious Ritz robes every time we got back from the pool. I have more pictures of them lounging in the room in their robes than I do of the property itself! Too funny. With two little ones in tow, I didn't get a chance to do the spa, but it looked amazing.

It was clean and made up with teddy bears sheet and a bumper. We also received a little baby care gift pack. The property itself is also lovely. The grounds are so well manicured! It was a treat just walking around. The staff was very nice and attentive. Everyone was very friendly. Housekeeping was a bit spotty, but we were in our rooms a lot, so it didn't bother us. The Ritz pool is just okay. There is no shade and some people hogged all the pool rafts, which was annoying. The Marriott pool was awesome! We loved the lazy river.

I would definitely recommend spending more time at the Marriott pool than the Ritz pool (although the Ritz pool chairs are padded and have canopies over them). The fitness center was really nice. Each piece of equipment has its own personal tv and a bottle of water and towel is laid out for you. Now the down sides... For a luxury resort, we found it very odd that there was no complimentary coffee. There is a Peet's cart in the lobby in the morning, but it was crowded and took a long time to get coffee. The rooms are expensive...no coffee? Cheap hotel rooms usually have coffee makers in them. It just felt a bit like we were being gouged. I know it's a small thing, but it just annoyed us. Valet parking. Honestly, I hate valet parking in general, so I know I'm biased. The cars are parked a two minute walk from the front door. It's Orlando...not NYC! There is no shortage of land. But okay...it's a luxury resort...but several times when we called down we still had to wait for our car when we arrived downstairs. If we have to pay for valet parking and then tip the attendant several times a day (whenever we took out the car), I think the least the hotel could do is make sure that service is quick. Food.

After staying at several Ritz properties, we anticipated a luxurious experience with top notch food and service. In short, we returned early because of extreme heat, sub-par food and poor service. On the positive side, the property is magnificent, the location is perfect for escaping to the occasional tourist destination, George Butts played beautiful music in the lounge and the spa is exceptional. Spa treatment rooms, for example, feature tables that automatically adjust for the perfect massage. My wife said the pregnancy massage was the best one she ever had, and the nail services were also excellent. The relaxation areas were bare bones - no place to put your feet up, no current magazines and bare bones snacks (hot tea, flat water and a huge bowl with one apple). The breakfast buffet was what I would expect from the Embassy Suites. Omelette station feauturing plastic-tasting eggs, bagels, muffins and pastries that tasted \"fake\" for lack of a better word. FYI - there is basically one kitchen. Lunch and dinner tasted like chain restaurant fare, which is what we hoped to avoid by staying at a luxury property. Even the adjoining JW Marriott's restaurant, Primo, had almost the same menu items. The service at the Vineyard Grill was incredibly slow (lunch with a toddler took more than 80 minutes for basic menu items such as salads and burgers) - and the restaurant was never busy. Norman's is supposed to be excellent, but coats are required for dinner and we didn't want to leave our son with a babysitter. While they clearly intend to cater to families, the restaurants rarely provided silverware and a napkin for my three-year-old and we had to ask for crayons and a children's menu every time we dined on the property. Housekeeping is supposed to come twice daily, but on several occasions they had not arrived by 3:30pm in the afternoon when we were hoping to tuck in our son for a nap. The management gave the excuse that they had until 4pm to make up the room, and that this is a \"leisure\" resort. We rarely got turndown service, and waited an hour for an extra pillow. Guests with small children should know that their bed rails are not tall enough to extend beyond the mattresses. In fact, the person who brought the bed rail apologized and recommended pushing the bed against the wall for some protection. The concierge staff is polite, but not particularly well informed. I highly recommend calling the valet staff from your room so that you do not have to wait for your car. If you stay in the Summer, be sure to ask them to turn on the air conditioning. For some reason, the valets never thought to do this on their own. Children under five are not eligible for the Ritz Kids program. You can buy them a tube to ride on the Marriot's Lazy River for $5 or rent a bicycle for two at $50 for 30 minutes. Be prepared - there is no shade over the pool at the Ritz or the little playground. With some better management, this hotel could easily be elevated to the Ritz standard.

We travel often and stay at a Ritz Carlton property as much as possible. This one did have some flaws, but there was no mistaking that you were staying at a Ritz. POOL - Beautiful pool area with truly wonderful cushioned pool chairs. The pool temp was on the warm side - just right for us. The pool got a little too croweded on Saturday and Sunday, but was fine on the weekends. It seems like there were some people from the adjoining JW Marriott using the Ritz pool, which is allowed. Although the pool area at the JW is stunnihg and includes a lazy river, the chairs are not cushioned. Service at the pool ranged from excellent to poor. Some of the things that we ordered never arrived or took forever. At different times there were staff floating about with cool towels and fresh fruit. Overall, it was the best part of our trip. FURNISHINGS - Superb decor! However, this was the least comfortable Ritz bed that I have ever slept in. HOUSEKEEPING - Not bad, but I would have liked to have seen the beautiful bed covers and pillows returned to the bed during the day, not rolled up and shoved in the corner.

Overall, this was a great property - the best hotel in Orlando and in my opinion, one of the best of the Ritz Florida locations (no beach, so that takes away some). Here are my thoughts on this property in the following sections - Excellent, Good but not Great and Problems: Excellent ------------- + Nice sized rooms & bath with quality furnishings you would expect at an RC property. Hotel is about 3 years old, so everything still has a new feel. + Great pool, comfy chairs and OUTSTANDING pool service (ice cold hand towels to cool you down, samples of fruit and smoothies brought around periodically, wait staff constantly checking on you to see if you need food or drink, pool attendants were always willing to help set up chairs, move umbrellas, whatever you needed) + Overall look of the Grande Lake resorts is quite nice with beautiful grounds and pleasant golf course & lake views + Great food at Vineyard Grill & Bleu (poolside restaurant) + Location. 5 miles from Disney, 5 miles from Airport, 5 miles from Mall at Millenia shopping. Overall, a great location if you are there for R&R and Disney & other parks. Good But Not Great ------------------- o Spa was large, serving both the RC and JW properties. The service at the spa was not quite up to RC standards, but probably because they serve close to 1000 rooms when you count the JW, plus locals. The men's waiting area for treatments was not large enough for the number of treatment rooms. Spa service was \"okay\" o Service at Vineyard Grill was spotty. The breakfast buffet area is a bit small for the size of the dining room, which may be the reason they require you to wait 10 to 15 mins to be seated when the restaurant is half empty. Still it is annoying when you have other things to do. o Housekeeping. While they did a good job of cleaning the room for the most part, they often were not finished with cleaning until 5pm. That's way too late when you are wanting to get in from the pool to get ready for dinner, and the maid is still in the room cleaning. Found some issues that were reported, and corrected, but did cause some inconvenience. Problems ---------- - Valet Service is probably the worst I have experienced. It doesn't matter if you call 10 minutes ahead or if you walk up to get your car, it still takes a 10 to 15 minute wait once you arrive at the bell stand. They say it is due to construction to add to the conference center, but they need to correct this ASAP, as they require valet (who wants to self-park anyway) and charge a hefty fee, and this leaves an overall bad taste for the property when it is so inconvenient to leave the hotel for dinner, outings, etc. - Pool gets crowded, and there seems to be a number of JW guests using the RC pool. With 2 large hotels together, they need to make the RC pool exclusive to RC paying guests to allow for good availability of chairs and umbrellas. In summary, I think this property has the chance for a 5 star Mobil/AAA rating if they can iron out a few kinks. The service generally is outstanding (everyone notices and mentions the negatives unfortunately). I would not hesitate to recommend this property to friends or business associates.

The outside grounds and facilities are wonderful. The spa is incredible. We were treated like royalty there.

Our kids got sand in the bathtub from the beach and it was not rinsed. We NEVER saw the quilts/mattelasse and pillows on the bed. They were always on the floor folded up, even after the early maid service. Sometimes, only one bottle of water was left and clean glasses were not put in the room. We ate breakfast everyday at the Vineyard Grill and the service was slow and not very good. Because we knew we would be returning each day, we felt compelled to tip well. There appeared to be several servers who only had a handful of tables each, but they were slow to return from wherever they were retreating to. Samantha seated us everyday and was quick to do so and very nice. There were mornings we had to wait for up to 10 minutes before a server showed up. There is only valet parking for $18+ per night. And, they do charge per night, not 24 hour period. I had always thought if one paid handsomely for valet parking, tipping was optional. These valets, although good, generaly seemed to wait for a tip each time, which can really add up. We stay at Ritz Carltons every chance we get. We've stayed at better ones.

I had mixed feeling at this hotel. I usually come to Orlando to go to disney, but this trip we decided to try the other attractions including Sea world. This property is an interestging concept. Two hotels, a JW Marriott and a Ritz Carlton comprise a large shared property incluing gym, two pool areas, spa and golf course. The Ritz is much smaller and intimate with better service The JW a large convention hotel. The two properties connect via their convention area. The walk from one to the other is about 7 minutes. The rooms were what you would expect at a Ritz, nice bedding, big bathrooms. But no coffee makers(a surprise at a luxury property) and coffee in the lobby was not complimentary. Rooms were average size with a terrace. Service at the Ritz was spotty, house keeping issues needed to be requested several times( a fridge I requested prior to check in needed to be requested 3 times). The concierge was fine(there are 7 restaurants on property and they did not have the menus for them). All other reservations I requested were accommodated. The pool at the ritz was what you would expect. The pool at the Marriot is spectacular, a long lazy river pool).

Here are my comments: Driving in was beautiful, everything immaculate and in order. Beautiful landscaping and cobblestone drive. It must take a small army to keep this up. Valet promptly took our car and offered to help with our bags, we only had one so we declined. Check in was very busy. I felt as if I were in a theme park line- however, they quickly resolved this by adding new staff to check in guests and to offer fresh lemonade while you waited. There was staff there to make you comfortable and chatted with us while we were in line. Reception area very spacious and full of fresh flowers beautiful couches and marble floors. Very elegant and appealing. Upon check in, we were immediately upgraded to a suite (we went on the AMEX platinum card). For the record, I frequently use AMEX platinum travel services in hopes that we are upgraded (they guarantee an upgrade IF one is available). We also enjoy the late check out, complimentary breakfast every morning and lunch during our stay and early check in. We tipped the clerk generously and he showed us to our room. It was a suite on the second floor. As you walk in the room there was a half bath on the left and the hall opened up to a living room area and balcony. then there were double doors that opened to a bedroom (king bed) and a full bath with walk in shower and closet. It also had a patio off the bedroom. Furniture and bedding was up to Ritz standards. A few housekeeping issues that irked me. Bathroom toilet seat falling off, light bulbs needed replacing and, under bed, there was garbage and slippers from previous guests. The night stand also had sticky stuff on it that was never cleaned off. These are just minor observances and didn't bother us enough to say anything during our stay, we just told the clerk upon checkout to fix them for the next guest. Pool area- always enough chairs for everyone. It was cool during our visit, so I am sure that a lot of guests opted not to sit by the pool. However, we found it delightful and always found a perfect chaise in the sun to relax on. The pool was warm and inviting however there was no \u201cdeep end\u201d so you could walk from one end to the other. When you got chilly, the hot tub was delightful. Dining was nice as well. We were casual for our trip so we generally ate at the poolside bar Bleu and the Vineyard Grill (casual restaurant inside) and room service for dinner. Food was nice and presentation was good. The drinks poolside were very expensive ($12 for a frozen drink- but hey it\u2019s the Ritz). I have to say that the coffee that the Ritz served was the best coffee I have ever had. My husband and I asked several times for the brand name however, the staff didn\u2019t seem to know. They sold Pete\u2019s coffee in the gift shop, so perhaps it was Pete\u2019s? Tap water was sulfur and that rang true with the shower and bath, but in Florida, sulfur water is commonplace. It wasn\u2019t too overwhelming. Just a hint of it. Spa- The two times I visited the spa, they seemed very understaffed. The line to check in or inquire about a service was always at least 5 deep (perhaps it was a fluke). Went browsing the spa gift shop to see if the line would dissipate, and found that the spa shop needed some attention. Clothing falling off hangers, and general tidiness issues. Needless to say when I finally got my turn at the desk (I also bought some spa gifts) I inquired about a service for the next day and the gentleman handed me a brochure and told me to call later- I felt as if he wanted to push me aside and say \"next\"- needless to say I didn't call back. We walked around the JW Marriott (which adjoins the property) to check it out-and we were glad that we decided on the Ritz. Even though Marriott now owns Ritz Carlton, we thought that there was a substantial difference in staff and atmosphere between the two hotels. Staff- this was the only thing that made me give 4 stars instead of 5. Staff was spotty. Some excellent. Namely, Amanda at the vineyard grill who went out of her way to purchase me some aloe vera gel with her own money to sooth my sunburn, Jared at the pool bar who was very kind and attentive and everyone at the front desk, who were a great \"front\" for the Ritz and were completely professional at all times. However, there was plenty of staff who were aloof. For example we were at the lounge bar one late afternoon for a cocktail and were waited on promptly. However, as we sat with empty glasses for over 10 minutes, we kept glancing over at the bar, and there were at least 5 young staff members standing around chatting about something and completely ignored us. We had to get up to get the bill, and when I got the bill, I felt as if I were interrupting their conversation. We did not go back to the lounge bar and thought that the service was completely out of line for Ritz. Also, at lunch one afternoon (granted I believe we came in late) we were not even done with our lunches and the waitress dropped off the bill to us saying \u201cI am going to leave this here for your convenience \u2013 in case you have to go to afternoon tea or somewhere in a hurry\"\u2026.never offered us coffee or dessert-. Not very professional. Overall- this place is HUGE, and I would imagine one of the largest Ritz out there. It must be very difficult to staff and maintain that many rooms and public spaces. We LOVE Ritz-Carlton\u2019s and generally travel to places were we can stay at one. However, I would say that this Ritz just didn't live up to the \"cozy\" feeling you generally get such as the Ritz at Central Park, San Francisco, St Thomas, or other cities. It felt very different. Perhaps it was that they obviously catered to large groups and corporate meetings? were not sure. I think we would travel here again if we were coming to Orlando, maybe during an off peak time.

That pool was heated and there was a nice kids playground over there and a really fun life size chess game as well as a mini soccer field. My complaint about the lazy river is that you have to buy the floats for $5 each. They are huge, and you have to lug them back and forth to your room! I think if they are going to charge you, why not let you pay $5 to rent them for the duration of your stay and then leave them at the pool? Due to the weather, the outdoor dining option at the Ritz was closed, but the bar was open at the JW pool. I ordered 2 Cokes for my children and the bartender snapped, \"They are $3 each, you know\"......which I found both odd and rude. Service at the Ritz is FAR superior.

The Grande Lakes resort is absolutley spectacular, its beautiuful, spacious, luxurious, GRAND, and VERY unique, its the first time in the history of both Marriott and Ritz Carlton that both hotels are built on the same property. 2 of the most finest and luxurious hotel brands in the world on the same property. In fact, Grande Lakes is so unique that even our Florida Governor Jeb Bush was present at the grand opening in 2003. Theres so much at the Grande Lakes that I categorized it to make it easier for you to read through this review: THE 2 LOBBIES: Both hotels have absolutley beautifull lobbies, the second you walk into the lobby you can easily notice that you have walked into a luxurious 5 star hotel. At the entrance of the Ritz Carlton you find formally dressed bell-hops awaiting you with perfectly tailored uniforms, pearl white gloves, and very friendly smiles, if you chose you can also have a private classic Rolls Royce pick you up directly from the airport or wherever you are coming from in Orlando. Inside the lobbies you find shiny marbles floors, grand sparkling chandeliers, fine artwork, comfy high-quality furniture, and extra friendly and very formally dressed front desk clerks readily availiable to help you at the spacious shiny front desk counters. The Ritz Carlton lobby has the more classic Ritzy touch while the JW Marriott has a more contemporary formal touch with a tranquil central fountain and tall curved roofs and columns. DINING: When it comes to dining, the Grande Lakes resorts are home to some of the finest dining restaurants in Orlando. The 2 feature fine dining restaurants are Norman's at the Ritz Carlton Orlando and Primo at the JW Marriott Orlando. There are also many additional restaurants including the Vineyard Grill, Citron, Bleu, and others, there are also many fine bars and lounges.

However, we recently stayed here for 1 night and what a revelation! The Club Floor was so good that I actually think I might make a trip back to Orlando just because of it! Firstly, the quality and variety of the food servings was superb and on a par with my benchmark Ritz at Naples. The staff were universally excellent and Stephen especially is worthy of mention. Also, I have never seen such fast and efficient clearing of tables as I witnessed in the Club Lounge - even more so when considering the number of children who were in there (not surprising, being in Orlando). The hotel is also very good generally and benefits from being new, so the bathrooms have separate baths and shower stalls for example and accommodation throughout is in good condition. The setting is attractive, overlooking the golf course with great views from the higher floors. Despite considerable grazing on the Club Floor we still managed a main course for dinner at the Vineyard Grill - it was OK, but nothing to write home about. We went back to the Club for dessert and watched the Disney fireworks - very enjoyable.", "Date": "April 19, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ritz-Carlton Orlando Grande Lakes", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d258647-Reviews-Ritz_Carlton_Orlando_Grande_Lakes-Orlando_Florida.html", "Price": "$233 - $644*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4012 Central Florida Parkway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Orlando</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">32837</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515940", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ed/0d/ed0dd11b02c0dd698111741aa5992abc6large.jpg"}}
