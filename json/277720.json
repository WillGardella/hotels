The hotel is nicer than many of the casino hotels on the strip. It does NOT have a casino so if you want that you will have to go up the strip, which is easily accessible by car or on foot. You ARE on the strip between Circus Circus and The Stratosphere, but far enough away from the congestion of the main part of the strip. The have a really nice little deli/store that is well stocked with all sorts of goodies and necessities and not too expensive. And the pools are gorgeous, we didn't swim because it was colder while we were there but our 16th floor room had a perfect view of the pools and they were beautiful. The rooms are big and really nice. Valet parking was reasonable, $13 a day as opposed to self park at $8, I say spend the extra five bucks and save yourself the walk.

We had a one bedroom suite which had a full kitchen, washer/dryer in unit and a jacuzzi tub for two, please note that the jacuzzi tubs are in tower one only, you need to ask at the check in desk for one if that is what you want. Our unit appeared to be recently updated with new carpet and furniture as everything seemed to be in like new condition. The Hilton is an upscale time share property and the units are nicely furnished and decorated. This is our second stay at this property and was able to get the unit for $109/nt for a 7 night stay, well worth the money. The parking situation has improved with the addition of their parking structure, when we last stayed there about 6 years ago parking was a nightmare. We did not use the pool due to the weather but it appeared to be well kept and a pleasant place to spend the day, if the weather cooperates. Everyone we dealt with at the resort was very friendly and helpful, this as always is a real pleasure. At no time did we get any pressure to do a time share tour. The only downside is the location, it is a good 15 minute walk to the Wynn with only Circus Circus and Riviera in between. During the daytime it is not bad, but at night the the walk just doesn't seem all that safe. There is the bankrupt Fontenbleau construction project across the street from the Hilton and the bankrupt Echelon construction project south of the Hilton, the Sahara recently closed just north of the Hilton, so the immediate area around the resort is a little bit sketchy. We had a rental car so it wasn't that bad but having a nice safe walk to something close would have been nice. The hilton property itself felt very safe and was in excellent condition so that is not a concern if you should go there, just be aware that a car is very helpful.

Tower 2 29th floor, 1 bedroom suite with Jacuzzi and full kitchen. We had an awesome view of the mountains and the Stratosphere. King size bed was very comfortable.

We were approached re: the time share presentation, but there was no pressure when we politely declined. I guess how much pressure you experience depends on the person who is pushing the presentation. All the staff we encountered at the hotel were helpful, friendly and appeared genuinely interested in our well being.The MarketPlace on the first floor has some groceries,beer, wine, sandwiches, pizza and desert for purchase. Prices were 3.00 - 8.00 for breakfast items, 8.50 - 10.00 for sandwiches and 14.50 - 17.50 for pizza. We did not eat any of the items, so we cannot comment on the quality, but what we saw looked very good, with substantial portions. We bought breakfast items, snacks and liquor from the CVS one block down, which has slightly lower prices. The full kitchen has pots, pans and utensils for cooking. A coffemaker and toaster. Plates, silverware and glassware. There was even a wine opener! We did not experience any noise issues You can walk to the Stratosphere in 10 minutes.(it looks closer than it is). The area is kind of seedy, so be \"big city observant\" of your surroundings. We would not recommend walking around there late at night. Walking down the strip toward Circus Circus is a much nicer walk. If you don't want to walk, the valets will will hail one of the cabs which are waiting at the hotel. Interesting fact: you cannot hail a cab off the street in Vegas. You have to go to a casino or hotel taxi stand where a valet will hail one for you. A cab ride from the Hilton to the end of the strip will cost around 20.00 without tip. The Deuce Bus will cost 7.00 per person for a 24 hour pass. The bus picks you up right outside the hotel, but be aware, it drops you off on the opposite side of the street, and there is no traffic light or crosswalk. It is a harrowing experience crossing the road. It is also jaywalking, which can get you a ticket, so always use the crosswalks and cross the street only when the walk sign is lit. The only reason we cannot give this facility 5 stars is due to a housekeeping issue. We had one day of housekeeping service during our stay, This was suppose to happen on day 3. We left used towels on the floor,as directed, for pick up and left for the day. When we returned the only evidence housekeeping had been there was the water in the flowers had been changed. We spoke with the front desk, who said they would speak with housekeeping. We had expected housekeeping would come back to pick up the used towels and replace them with new ones, but that did not happen. The same towels were still on the floor when we checked out on Friday.

We had no issues with the suite or any of the hotel amenities or staff. Paying $13/day for valet parking ($8/day for self park) seemed like a frivolous charge (free at Marriott which is closer to the action) but considering our suite rate it was still a great bargain. We had friends staying at the same time, they complained that they had no water pressure and the hot water wasn't hot. Our family staying there had the same complaint. The master bathroom in the suite seemed like it was a design after-thought and the shower an after-after-thought. Getting out of th eshower without two bathmats results in a very wet tile floor. The lights in the bathroom are dim and there are multiple light switches instead of the typical one or two. The light in the shower was very close to my head (I'm 6'3\" tall) and I bumped it several times while showering. Something about electrical devices and water makes me nervous. Regardless of building codes I don't trust the light in the shower. The purpose of the trip was for a family member to 'upgrade' their 'vacation property deed'.

Check in was slow and the agent did nothing to recognize my status, did not pay attention to my room type preferences in my profile. Asking if I wanted Non-Smoking room, well I booked a non-smoking room, and my profile list this as my most important preference. I also have it listed to be on a high floor and away from the elevators. I was put on a mid-level one door away from the elevator. FAIL! This is not hard, this is when it was clear to me I was just a number at this super large hotel. The name of this hotel is Hilton Grand Vacations Suites on the Las Vegas Strip.. I did book a \u201cStudio\u201d so I expected a small studio suite, but the word suite is blatant false advertisement. I was given a room, a small and poorly appointed room at that. The room (or as they call it Studio) reminded of a Hilton Garden Inn room, that was missing some things like a DESK, people do come to Vegas for work, no desk in the room?? There was a small round table with stiff chairs. There was a wet bar, AKA Microwave and college dorm room size refrigerator. The shower had a very old brown shower curtain and had a mildew smell. The room had a connecting door that allowed me to hear the conversations of the room next to me. Also the light from under the door was distracting in my dark room. There is nothing special about this place, and if they really want people to buy time shares and this is the room they gave one of Hilton\u2019s most loyal, good luck to them. The food options at this place is also an example why so many Americans are fat. I booked a rate with breakfast and it was good for a Breakfast sandwich, small coffee and a small OJ. The egg sandwich was a \u201cegg patty\u201d plastic cheese and one little slice of bacon. Zero healthy options for me. So disappointing. FAIL! Now for the parking, self parking... they should be shamed for charging $8.00 per night. I have never ran into a hotel in Vegas that charges for parking. You also take your life into your own hands in the parking garage as the people who valet the cars speed up and down the ramps (in someone else's car). Shocking to see how these people have no respect for others vehicles and just reckless behavior. They must know there is an issues as they have cones blocking every corner parking spot in the garage, giving them a place to pull out of the road as they fly around blind turns.. FAIL!

On this trip I was pleased to stay away from all of that on the north end of the strip towards the tower at the Hilton Grand Vacations Suites. Since I had a car and my business took me several places beyond the touristy parts of the main strip, the location was not a big deal for me. The suite I had was in Tower 1 and was very clean and perfectly appointed. It was more than a comfortable location to conduct a week's worth of work. Since I knew in advance that the suite had its own washer and dryer, I was able to pack lightly and only use carry-on's by washing my clothes mid-week. The full kitchen and refrigerator allowed me to grab some essentials at a nearby grocery store and keep my dining expense down while at the same time maximizing time available to conduct my business. I could wake up, have coffee and a light breakfast and be done with it, ready to go in the time it would have taken me to go out and spend twice as much money. The hotel has limited amenities regarding food/bev. It's not like your typical strip hotel with two large buffets and four high-end restaurants. Instead, there is one very basic pantry/coffee shop that has the basics with enough options to get by for all three meals. There is also a CVS right next to the hotel with a fairly large food/bev section if you need to supplement whatever the hotel doesn't offer with goodies for your room. If those options don't suffice, then you can always hop on the Deuce bus for $5 (one day) or $7 (24hrs) and ride up and down the strip to your heart's content, getting off at whatever hotel or restaurant strikes your fancy.

It was quite a disappointment on many levels. 1) Location: location is awful. It's on the \"wrong\" end of the Strip, a cab ride from everything. Seedy individuals and prostitutes were a regular sighting when I ventured out to the bus stop. 2) Rooms: HGV uses a very loose definition of \"suite.\" Mine was a Ramada Inn type of room, with a non-functional dorm fridge and microwave. Hardly a \"suite.\" Walls were paper thin, so I heard all of the comings and goings next door. Kind of like having roomates., 3) Broadband: It's free, and worth every penny. Really a joke--I was unable to get much of any work done, as it crapped out regularly. Tried various floors and the lobby as well, no better. 4) Maid service: this is gross, but I'll share. My first day, while in the shower I noticed a rather large black hair on one of the walls of the shower stall (about 6 feet up). I'm 5'7, and blond, so it clearly wasn't mine. Over the course of my five day stay, I was curious to see if the maids would catch it. Guess what? They didn't. Yuck, what else did they miss? 5) Green = crappy features. The hotel's ridiculous \"green\" kick means you get \"features\" such as CF bulbs (one popped in the lamp while I was there), and low-flow showerheads in the bathroom. 6) The hotel doesn't care about any of this. When asked upon checkout how my stay was, I shared this feedback. The clearly untrained staff member in charge of checkout on my departure date didn't appear to think that any of this warranted any action.

If you have HGVC points, call the hotel directly first, it may be cheaper to pay cash for the nights than using your HGVC or RCI points. The studio-suites have a DVD player, refrigerator, microwave, dishes, silverware, etc. Downstairs there is a store, pool table, rectcreation room, gym, and coffee shop. The business center cost twenty cents an minute for internet access; wireless access was free in my room. BTW, if you use points you will get free parking but you will not get daily housekeeping, which was expected. We did get a couple phone calls to see how things were going and to tell us about things in the area. The pool was large, 3.5 feet deep, heated during our stay and nice. The sun does not reach the pools until the 12 so it can be a bit cool in the shade; however, they have several jet world-pools that are very warm-hot until then\u2026 You can get food and drinks at the Waves Bar in the pool area; the Bar was closed on Monday.

Well, the otld BUY RIGHT NOW or lose thousands of incentives, without the benefit of even reading all the contracts was the order of the day. So we do not buy real estate or vacation plans for 10's of thousands of dollars that way, Heck I do not buy mellons at the grocer that way. So I guess if you go there with that attitude and make up your mind not to be convinced otherwise, the stay was ok, a little out side the central stirp area, south, near the old Sahara, most of the big casino properties this far south on the strip are closed down and in foreclosure. Staff was great, very helpful, not pushy and the Hilton Brand quality was maintained. However, since this particular property is not a casino/hotel, resturants had to be found elsewhere. No full service resturant was available onsite. Now a word on one Airline Ticket Consolidator, OneTravel.com, I was a little naive here also. I thought they were going to provide the best price, and also some ongoing support between the time I pruchased the tickets, (june, 2011 and November, 2011). I did not get a price that was reflective of such an advance booking, I did not realize that until other specials came out during the time we were waiting to travel. Anyway, I guess that is the point here. I should have waited some before purchasing. Anyway, I had tickets on Air Tran, USAir, and United for the round trip. Also, I recieved NO added value from them with regards to trying to refine my trip with the airlines, seats, etc. I will most likely go back to booking directly with the airlines, like I always have done in the past. I would, however, love to hear other experiences with these companies. Maybe I have other thing to learn regards how I interface with them. One more comment, Las Vegas Taxi cab drivers are mostly crooks!!!! They all say they are from Ethiopia, may be true. However, the first cab we traveled in, went around the block avoiding the Stirp right where our destination was for about 15 minutes. I had a GPS application running on my Droid phone and could see the circles we were going in. What should have been a $10.00 ride was up to 23.75 on the meter. WHen I confronted him, he said \"... no pay, no pay, you no pay...\" meaning the meter cost, and after some angry words he gave us a verbal price of $12.50. This happened 3 times!! three different cab companies. The only difference was whether the driver was rude or apologetic, the result was the same. My rules, check with the Hotel staff to see if you can walk, then if not, ask them how much the cab SHOULD charge. Be prepared to FIGHT for that price, And threaten to take id and call LV Taxi Cab Commision. WHEW! Now I have told somebody. This interaction was the most stressful part of the trip until I realized what was happening. Be your own advocate.

There is a recycle bin as you walk into building from parking garage. I would stay here again in a heartbeat, but again, it would be a pain without a rental car. Bus is close, but I would find some deals through Alamo. On a busy week we stacked a Alamo Insider coupon and another coupon and paid $97.50 for a week. I couldn't believe it. Great deal, but you have to do your homework. For tips on Vegas read the forum on Trip Advisor Las Vegas...I learned a lot on there and saved a small fortune. My g.f. tried the spa. It was solid. If you have a car I recommend the following: ***Use I15 to get to most places on the South End of the Strip. For the Venetian (mid strip) and Downtown we just used LV BLVD. Mind you crossing LV Blvd is not for the timid. ***Budget at least 5 hours for Valley of Fire State Park. Go in the morning if you can. It was one of the nicest places I have been to in the U.S. ***See Cirque de Soleil Beatles LOVE. WOW!!!!!!!!!! You can sit anywhere and like it. ***Venetian Grand Lux Cafe (also one in Palazzo) was the best place for reasonably priced sit down food. Expect $20pp for a great meal. A little more if you order something fancy or go hog wild. They have great small plates and we would order a few then split an entree. ***M Resort is a bit of a drive down I15 but the buffet was awesome and a tremendous value at lunch. Sunday brunch was $35 but had a lot more. Free beer and wine (and cider on Sunday's) as well as free Cappuccino. ***We did a fancy dinner at Triple George downtown very close to Freemont Street. Service was excellent and we found a coupon/cheap gift cert. on Restaurant.com. They make great fish and steak. ***We also went out to Red Rock Canyon at dawn. It's a 13 mile loop with some great hikes. I would do this before doing (not in the same day) as Valley of Fire as Valley of Fire is more beautiful, imo. Ok, hope those tips help. Oh yeah, we had no kids, but if I had to bring kids to Vegas (I wouldn't) this would be a good place to stay.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cIdeally located for our LV trip.\u201d", "Author": "orlando_fan_62", "ReviewID": "UR121673957", "Content": "We prefer to stay in apartments rather than hotels, the Hilton was ideal for us.

For the budget-concious, the microwave and fridge mean less meals out, but the expensive parking means you need to either take a taxi to the store or shop in the (very expensive) mini-mart in the basement. For folks with kids, you'll have to book at least a basic suite to get more than one bed in the room so it's no longer cost-effective. And for me, not having a restaurant or bar is the deal-breaker as these are minimum amenities you would expect to find at a property bearing the Hilton name. Even moreso in Las Vegas. This would be more tolerable if the property were closer to any real dining options (the closest hotel/casino is Circus Circus which is not known as the culinary epicenter of Vegas) or if the hotel offered a free shuttle to its sister properties in Las Vegas.

Although, not my first choice in Vegas, we, like other reviewers, agreed to attend a timeshare presentation at this location. We have stayed at many Hilton hotels and figured this would be just as good, or we hoped, better than other Hilton properties. Our first impression at check-in at this hotel was awful! I called in advance to see about an early check-in since our flight arrived at 12:30 pm & advertised check-in was at 4PM. Was told that it shouldn't be a problem to check in early. Upon arrival at the hotel at approx 1:30pm, we were told there weren't any rooms available. I explained to the woman at the front desk that we were promised a penthouse suite (which I had in writing from Hilton & showed her), she looked confused & went back to another office & after about 5 minutes finally told us that they didn't think there were any of those rooms available. We found out later that any room above floor 25 are considered \"penthouse\" rooms???? Since rooms weren't available at check-in, the front desk took our cell phone number & indicated they would call us as soon as our room was ready. We explained we had dinner reservations at 7PM & wanted to shower & change since we'd been flying since early AM. She said that they would contact us BEFORE 4PM. This was fine with us, so we stored our luggage with the bellhop & decided to kill some time. Hadn't heard anything by 4pm, so we called the resort at 4:15pm & spent 10 minutes on hold before we hung up. At 6PM, we still had not heard anything from them & just went back to the hotel. The front desk replied \"sorry, we've been busy & didn't have time to call you.\" Really???? Not a good first impression! Although the room was o.k. - just a standard hotel room, the temperature control was not working properly. We had it set to 65 degrees, but it was still hot & stuffy in the room. The bathroom was small & supplied with only two bath towels. It was necessary to buy bottled water to drink or for the in-room coffee maker, as the water from the tap was horrible & never got cold. The \"kitchen facilities\" consisted of a coffee maker, toaster, microwave & small fridge. Keep in mind if you are staying at this property there is no restaurant on site - just a very over-priced deli/convenience store in the lower level. Walking to the nearest casino and/or restaurant was at least 10-15 minutes (the Riviera). In our 3 days on this trip, we probably spent about $200 on taxi fare. I know we could have traveled cheaper by bus, but the time wasted with long lines, waiting for it to arrive & stopping every block, it was much faster using a taxi. The pool area looked o.k., however, the weather was too cold to use the facilities. I guess if you're going to Vegas & want a quiet, out of the way place, this may be ideal. However, if you want to gamble & be around great restaurants, I would certainly NOT recommend. This would be the last place I would ever consider purchasing a time share.

There is also no restaurant in the hotel, although it does have a small self-service market/caf\u00e9. Other amenities include a spa, nicely equipped Precor branded gym and a pool, along with a recreation room offering billiards and other table games. The staff was extremely efficient and professional. There is no resort fee, but parking is $8/day.

I've been to Las Vegas over three dozen times, not a big gambler so not having a casino in the building was not an issue. Our room was on the 21st. floor (there are 29 floors in all). The room was very nice, we had a 'one king bedroom suite' in tower one (which is facing the entrance is on the left). The kitchen was well appointed with tableware, utensils and appliances. The refrigerator has an ice maker that makes a very tiny amount of ice and it also very noisy, luckily there is an ice machine available on each floor. There is also a washer and dryer located in the kitchen. There is a desk adjacent to the dining area table that you have to pull a chair from the dining set to sit at. There is also high speed internet that is included in your stay and they give you the wifi password at check-in. One downside, not a big one, but internet service is intermittent at times and you always have to retype in the password each time you go on the internet. The living room is open to both the dining and kitchen areas and all share the same thermostat and it has a large window. The sleeper couch was very firm and comfortable as a couch, never tried it as a bed. There is a nice large, flat screen color television that swivels so it can be viewed while in the kitchen or dining area. The bedroom has a smaller flat screen TV and it's own thermostat and its own large window. There is a large Jacuzzi style tub that is open to the bedroom and a good size closet with ironing board, iron and extra linens. There is lots of drawer space in the dresser and it has a nice alarm clock as well. The bathroom has a shower stall but the water flow is not that great, not a pressure problem I think it is more a low flow shower head and no amount of twisting the head emits any more water. The bathroom has plenty of fresh towels, hair dryer and soaps. There are two doors to the bathroom, one opening into the bedroom and the other door opens to the entry of the unit. The main entrance is on the second floor, the first floor has access to the pools, gym and the marketplace. The marketplace serves fresh salads, sandwiches, pizzas and coffee. They also sell wine, beer, sodas and water as well as snack foods and candy. There is also frozen meals you can purchase, ice cream, frozen desserts and fresh items such as eggs and sausages that you can take back to your unit and prepare. There is also a small gift shop within that has a few items. While he Hilton is very clean, the staff is very helpful and polite and the elevators move incredibly fast there were some notable cons to the stay. Check in is not until 4 in the afternoon which is later than most hotels on the strip. Check-out is at 10 in the morning which is one to two hours earlier than most hotels on the strip. There were no 'Do Not Disturb' hangers for the door and housekeeping starts knocking on the door at 9 in the morning. Wouldn't be a problem if I was home getting ready for work but on vacation that is early, especially when you stay out late . . . it is Vegas. Overall the location is not all that great. Across from resort behind the now closed Sahara is one of the monorail platforms but it is not a safe nor is it easy to get to. If you walk up the strip further there is one at the Las Vegas Hilton, which is not on the strip and requires you to walk down a street that doesn't have too much foot traffic. Also there is nothing between the resort and Circus Circus along Las Vegas Blvd. and we encountered a few undesirable people along the way. So you are pretty much stuck taking taxi cabs to get around and it adds up quickly. Our ride from the airport to the resort with tip was close to $30. A few pointers on taxis, make sure you know the layout of the Las Vegas strip, you can print out a map and take it with you, one that shows all the hotels. If you travel up the strip and you want to go to a resort on the opposite side, choose a resort directly across from your destination then just walk across, saves you 5 to 10 dollars to do it this way since they don't have to go the back roads and loop around then backtrack to get you there. Same is true when heading back to the Hilton Grand Vacation Suites, take a cab from the opposite side that way they go straight down the boulevard and turn directly into the entrance. The Marketplace within the resort is convenient and the food is really good but it does tend to be a bit pricy. If you walk out the resort to the boulevard and turn right there is another condominium complex next door and they have a CVS that is much cheaper and it is a short walk. The price was average or fair, but many hotels along the strip are offering incredible deals to stay. I was rather shocked, I had originally booked my stay for Friday departing Sunday, which is the peak time for higher pricing then I switched it to Thursday departing Saturday, usually that Thursday would be the cheap fare at neighboring resorts but my reservation actually went up in price.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Freehold, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cWhy go to Vegas?\u201d", "Author": "WhereeverIgoThereIam", "ReviewID": "UR120157043", "Content": "The reason I went to Vegas was for my mother, 73, who likes to gamble.

Taxis always seemed to be available and there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel if you do not have transportation. The hotel is very clean, nice and a quiet getaway after a busy day/night on the town. In our 8 nights we never heard any other guests inside our room (we did have an end room). We stayed in a one bedroom room and it was very large with a full kitchen, dining room, living room, bathroom, Jacuzzi tub area and bedroom. The bed was one of the nicest beds I have had at a hotel. There is a washer and dryer in the room and we utilized it a fair amount. We were left 3 messages on our phone about a presentation for the time share and we just did not respond. We did stop by the welcome desk and were given a bag with some coupons that we did not use and were asked about setting up a time for a presentation. We told them we were not interested in listening to a presentation and that was the end of it. We never felt pressured to attend the presentation. If you are looking for a great place to relax and get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip this is a great place to stay.

We had no issues with the cleanliness either. The view wasn't the best but we didn't travel 15 hours to spend time in the hotel admiring the view! The pool was lovely and we had some food from the bar which was reasonably priced and good. We also used the Market Place for some breakfast items which although was a little more expensive had a good range to choose from. We also tried the lemon sponge cake which was delicious and well worth trying. We used the deuce bus to get around $7 pp for 24 hrs. The stop was just outside the hotel and we did have to negotiate a rather busy road when we got off the opposite side but it was okay. We tried the monorail on one occasion but wouldn't recommend it. The stop is quite distance away and it stops at the back of the casinos so quite some distance to get back to it. We had a fantastic night at Downtown Las Vegas and would definitely recommend it - it was great fun and a totally different experience to the main casinos. The deuce bus takes you straight there. We also visited Red Rock Conservation Reserve which the concierge gave us details of. We had a fantastic day and did a small walk (1.5 hrs). The views were stunning and definitely worth it to escape for a while. We took our own lunch and drink in as there is no where to get food.

He wasn't overly pushy but I had to turn him down twice. So try and skip that counter if you have a chance. Apart from that, our experience at the hotel was just fine. It's located on the far north end of the strip. There is construction going on right across the hotel but a CVS right beside the hotel too, which makes it incredibly convenient to get necessities and snacks. So it's a lot more quiet since you're not smack in the middle of all the activity. I loved the room we had picked because it came with a full-service kitchen which was even well-equipped with cooking utensils, serving plates, cutlery and everything you need to cook. So we made ourselves a little breakfast in the mornings over the stove and made use of the handy oven and dishwasher too. I even did a small load of laundry since the room came equipped with a washer and dryer! The rooms were clean and housekeeping was efficient and friendly too. Overall, a good stay. I would not hesitate to recommend HGV except for the fact that it's just a little inconveniently located on the far end. Downside: Although the most economical way to get around and to the heart of the strip was to hop on a bus (The Deuce) outside the hotel, a courtesy shuttle to the main strip would have been much appreciated since the Deuce was ALWAYS packed.

Being that it was a Hilton I was impressed with the grand drive in and undercover area, the lobby/foyer area, and how everything was set up in there. There is a separate area for check in, concierge, and tour desk. This way you don't have to wait behind 10 people checking in to get information regarding tours or ask the concierge to arrange something for you. I was in one of the 1 bedroom suites, which is quite large and has all the amenities you would need to be at home away from home. The kitchen is roomy and has a full size refrigerator, hidden washer/dryer combo in the kitchen as well. This leads on to the dining area and lounge. It is designed for no more than 4 people and would be quite suitable for 4 people on holidays. The bathrooms are quite large and the bath tub which is large enough to have to \"regular\" sized people sitting in it side by side is in an \"annex\" type room between the bathroom and bedroom, and is open enough to be viewed from the bedroom and v.v. - now this can have many connotations attached to it but we don't need to go there! Now, as I was there for a work related trip, I had the opportunity to view other rooms and I viewed the newly renovated rooms as well. The decor in these is quite a bit more modern, the bath tubs are also jacuzzi style as well as opposed to a soaking tub. Amenities in the hotel are not to be missed. Below the foyer is the cafe where you can pick up a breakfast sandwich for $7 - basically what you would have for breakfast on a plate but in a sandwich - very good idea and you don't have to sit there and eat but you can go back to your room with it. Just outside of this is the gym which is quite a large set up as well - plenty of equipment to choose from and open almost 24 hours a day.

Since the wedding was on the weekend I knew that while you can find some decent midweek deals,the traditional casino/resorts can be expensive for a Friday or Saturday. As regular Hilton traveler I had accumulated quite a few points so decided to spend them on this trip. Ended up wanting to stay a few post wedding days as well, so booked 5 nights at the Hilton LV Grand Vacation Club.This is a fine property with more plus than minus, but I will try to lay out both in fairness to the hotel, but also in fairness to my fellow TA travellers. First the location, as this is often front and center for Vegas visiters. The property is on the strip, but a long way down, almost to the Stratosphere. If you are without a car, this could be an issue. Walking down to the high traffic areas like the Wynn/Encore/Fashion Mall would be a hike. Probably at least 20-30 minutes. Down to the Ceasers/Flamingo/Bellagio another 15. There is a bus stop right outside however, and you can get a daily pass for $7, but somehow getting all dressed up to go to dinner and a show, and then taking the bus doesn't cut it. If you have a car this is no issue. We were at MGM, Planet Hollywood, and Ceasers within a few minutes, and parking is free at the casinos. Worth a mention here that parking is not free at the Hilton GVC. $8 a day for self park, $13 for valet. Add a dollar or two for a tip each time you get your car as well. Not mandatory, but it's the right thing to do. I didn't tip leaving the car, just on pick up. I would highly recomend the valet service. The self park garage is fairly close, but back and forth would be a pain. It was great to just pull up to the front door and leave the car. Further, the valet crew was above excellent. Never waited more than 5-6 minutes for the car and they were always pleasent and professional. This goes for the entire staff as well. Front desk, pool, housekeeping, concierge, everyone was very friendly, very helpful, and professional. Security was also friendly and plentiful. In, fact I was surprised at the level of security. I have stayed at a number of strip resorts and found more security here than anywhere. At the door every night, in the hallways at random times, on the elevator, all over, and they were also very friendly and helpfull to guests. As far as the hotel itself goes, we had a studio king and while very nice, it was a hotel room, not a vegas suite. This is not the Hilton's fault as it was exactly as advertised, however it left me a little wanting for the Vegas magic and I wanted to point this out. They have 1 bedroom suites which I saw, and they were huge, with seperate living room/bedroom. Pay the extra, it wasn't much, I would have but they were fulll the first two nights and we did not feel like moving after that. I should have done more research and pre planned. That is why I mention it here. There is also no casino here, (which I knew) and that also kinda takes away from the Vegas feel. We have done Vegas a bunch of times so not a huge deal, however I would recommend something else for first timers maybe. Final point on the rooms, don't take my comments as a negative on the room itself, it was fine. Clean, great bed, modern flat screen, even had a fridge and m/wave. One more point on the hotel is the pool. Nice size, lots of area for sunning and swimming, several hot tub/jacuzzis, and a pool bar/restaurent. Drinks and light snacks (burgers, nachos, chick fingers) were very good and quite reasonably priced. (was surprised at the prices here). If you are a sun lover, plan on the afternoon rather than morning as that is when the sun hits the pool area. Final point on the property would be that this is one of Hilton's \"Vacation Clubs\" .... which is code for time share....I got absolute zero presure to sit in on a TS sell. Yes I was asked at check in, and the girl took all of about two minutes to tell me what I could get by attending, and then said thank you when I said no. Don't worry about this aspect, they were not high presure on that at all. (Maybe if you take it they are...don't know bout that) Overall, a great hotel and I would highly recommend, but take into account the location and lack of \"vegas\" type ammenities.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Walsall, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAn Oasis at the end of the busy Strip\u201d", "Author": "whetstoneview", "ReviewID": "UR119317663", "Content": "This hotel is away from all the big themed hotels and has no casino. It is great to get away from all the crowds of the huge hotels on the Southern end of the Strip. Check-in was slick and efficient. The hotel is modern,spotlessly clean and spacious. We were with friends and were allocated a suite with two separate bedrooms and a living area between them. Each room had king beds and one had a jacuzzi. The bathrooms were good, one had an excellent walk-in shower. Soap and shampoo were provided and replaced once during the week, along with a linen and towel change. Facilities were good with televisions in each room and very comfortable seating. Each room had coffee making facilities with a small supply of ground coffee. The crockery, glassware and cutlery were in short supply considering the fact there was a dishwasher which you were unable to fill before running out of equipment. There was a washing machine and tumble dryer with detergent supplied. We were on the 22nd floor and had a great view of the mountains outside Las Vegas. The gym is well-equipped and modern. There is also an attracttive outside swimming pool with a cafe. The Marketplace had a small deli and shop which were a little expensive but convenient. There is a CVS pharmacy nearby which had a good stock of groceries and alcohol at reasonable prices. Fresh food was in small supply making it difficult to cook in the apartment.We also used Wahlgreen's which was a little further away but had a wider choice and was even cheaper. We had breakfast at Denny's which was about a ten minute walk away and this set us up for the day. Eating out can be as expensive as you want. There are food courts in a few of the hotels where you can choose from Chinese, Italian, burgers etc and eat very cheaply.We used the Venetian which had a good selection of cuisine. It is possible to walk the length of the Strip but it takes quite a long time. However, you're on holiday, and there is a lot to see en route! Taxis are readily available as well as the Deuce bus and the monorail. The nearest casinos are at Circus Circus and the Riviera but they are both quite old and a little tired. The Downtown area is in need of a new lease of life as some buildings have been removed and the infrastructure is limited. The Stratasphere is,quite literally,a beacon of glitz and glamour this end of the Strip. The two towers of HGV also add a golden sheen to the skyline.

We didn't want to change units so they got us into the same unit for our entire stay. I've read other tripadvisor reviews that said check-in was slow but we didn't encounter that. The rooms have a very similar layout to the HGV at the Las Vegas Hilton but are newer. We stayed in a two-bedroom suite with two separate bedroom units each of which has a king-size bed, one has an in-room jacuzzi, large shower and bathroom area with a full kitchen, dining area (accomodates 4), living room area with TV and pull-out couch inbetween the two bedroom units. The pool area is very nice with cabanna's, restaurant, wait-staff, etc. The service was top-notch throughout our entire stay. There are a lot of children out at the pool area but overall it was a good time. We like to walk in Vegas so it wasn't an issue for us but the couple with whom we were staying found the location inconvenient.

There is a CVS Pharmacy and another gift/sundries shop about a block or 2 blocks away where the prices are much less than the on-site deli/sundries shop. However, the on-site shop is very convenient and we got good service there. I did have a pedicure and manicure at the spa.

It's just too expensive at the resort. I'm not opposed to paying for things when on vacation, but I found this to be worse that NYC prices. Maybe that's the norm, but it seemed a little excessive.

Some posts mentioned an expensive cab ride to the strip hotels. This was not the case. This resort is located just north of the Riveria and south of the Stratosphere, so it is conveniently located along the bus route. We purchased a 24 hour bus pass for $7 which allowed us unlimited on & off stops. I am told that a 3 day pass may also be purchased, but we didn't need one, so I never checked. Also, along with the strip, the same bus system will take riders to downtown (Fremont Street) and the north & south Las Vegas outlet malls. As to the resort, it is a typical Hilton property. Our room was a studio, rents for $89/nightly and had mini kitchenette which included full size coffee maker, fridge, sink, & dishes. The room also had a flat screen tv and granite finishings in the bathroom & kitchenette area, king sized bed, desk, and chair & ottoman. I thought the price is accurate for the accomodations. The pool is great. Although there were many people there, we had plenty of lounge chairs, and space to feel comfortable. The pool area also provides grills for folks wanting that experience, and two families were \"grilling\" while we were there. This is a time-share property though, so make sure that you are not expecting a full service restaurant and bar. The food available is a deli & marketplace which others have described accurately, and a pub food & bar area around the pool. I had pizza from the deli & my husband had fish & chips from the pool bar area. Both were good. We purchased can beer from the marketplace and took it outside to the pool, this is a more economical way to enjoy adult beverages. While the sign posted said no outside alcohol, that must reference from other locations, because the marketplace staff said that we could do this and no one from the pool questions us. Beer at the marketplace was about the same as we find in our hometown liquor store. Staff is helpful and friendly. Check in time posted is 4pm, however, I called ahead and we were able to check in at 11am. Check out time is 10am, and the night before our check out I asked for an extension and was given until noon. No problems. Resort is extremely attentive to security. We had to show our room key, after 10pm before we could go inside the front door. I appreciate their attention to this. Also, room key had to be used for elevator access.

The accomodations are quite spacious. They could not though be deemed \"luxurious\", but rather average \"C+/B-\". All of the necessities are in place and intact.

The views from every room are magnificent and having the capacity to cook a meal such as breakfast in your own space is terrific though. The minimarket on site is fantastic with a variety of choices that you can prepare yourself in the kitchen as well as prepared (and good) sandwiches etc. You can have breakfast delivered to your unit. It was a relief not to have the clanging and banging of a casino and multiple restaurants on site.

It became somewhat incessant particularly due to the fact that we already owned a share. All in all very spacious accomodations with great views. Average, sterile furnishings.

This hotel is very nice, clean and quiet for the most part. I agree with other reviews the walls are way too thin, as you can hear people in the room next to you watching tv or listening to the radio whenever you happen to be in the room. THe noise from the motorcycles going up and down the strip was actually the worst. This really is the only complaint I have other than there is no vent in the bathroom. We stayed in Tower 1 in a suite overlooking the pool and we could see the sun setting in the west and Trump Tower in the distance. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have slept on in a hotel room & my spouse is 6' 3\" and he had no trouble fitting in the bed; the entire room was spotless. Most people have said that you cannot get a shuttle from the airport to the hotel, which is not true at all. We paid for a round trip fee of $26.00 for 2 at the airport shuttle area (take the Gray Line shuttle) and were dropped off at the hotel lobby and picked up us as scheduled in the same spot. Just specify Hilton on the strip and it is on their list of hotels. We were actually the 2nd stop from the airport since they looped around the strip; they actually stopped at the other Hilton off the strip first. We also bought the Grayline Deuce pass for the strip for a 24-hour period ($7.00 per person, worth every penny--you can pay as you get on, just have exact cash) and the bus stops right in front of the hotel, Grand Hilton Vacations, or right next door at Turnberry Place, by the CVS. On return trip going north, you will have to stop across the street, but we just walked across at our stop. The Deuce does stop more than the other shuttle, but you want the Deuce for your stop here. Also, you never know when you might want to stop and get out and look around since there is so much to see at each stop and walking is so far between each stop. I would stay here again, but do not ever do it through a time share - the staff for the time share are pretty ruthless and make you feel really bad if you don't vacation much. We just got a good offer for the weekend and knew we would have to go to this. They are required to meet with you for 2 hours no matter what-- that's what are rep told us-- and since we do not travel very much at all, she got very short and mad with us for basically wasting her time. Be prepared for some ruthless young sales reps who will do and say anything for a sale. We were let go after 45 minutes, so we felt lucky to get out of there after that amount of time.

I also had to contact housekeeping & check with the pool staff to make sure no one picked up the bag thinking we left it behind. The security officer told me there are no cameras in the pool area.

Our check-in person was Kevin. He gave us great advice on getting around, where to shop, etc, as this was our first time in Vegas. We declined the time share presentation and he upped the incentives. When we still declined, that was that. No pressure. He was just as friendly and helpful after we said no. What a welcome difference from other time-share resorts. Room was immaculate. Decor was retro, not our taste, but very comfortable. Kitchen was large and well equipped. My only nit-picks were I lacked a pitcher, a colander ( I cooked) and covered containers to store food. Loved being able to launder our clothes as it meant we could bring less and not have to pay baggage fee to airline. The Market Place IS convenient and the deli is reasonable for a resort. However, if you plan to do any eating in, a small box of corn flakes is $7, a Swanson Pot Pie is $5. The CVS next door is somewhat cheaper but still more expensive that home (Miami area) If you want to stock up, take a cab to Albertsons, $8. TIP: WHEN YOU ARE DROPPED OFF, GET THE CABBIE'S PHONE NUMBER FOR YOUR RETURN TRIP AS CABS DON'T HANG OUT THERE. A bottle of rum we paid $26 for at CVS was $16 at Albertsons. We used the bus, the Deuce to get around. If you want to go south to the main strip, you catch the bus in front of Circus Circus to the right of the hotel. Returning, you get off at Circus Circus and use the push-button cross walk. If you want to go downtown, you go left, use the crosswalk, and catch it in front of the sadly closed Sahara. TIP: WE WENT DOWNTOWN TO THE FREEMONT STREET EXPERIENCE. IF YOU DO THIS, MAKE SURE YOU GET A DOUBLE DECKER DEUCE TO RETURN. WE GOT ON ONE OF THE SLEEK, SINGLE LEVEL BUSES AS IT WAS LABELED FOR THE SOUTH STRIP. INSTEAD OF TAKING US BACK TO THE HOTEL, WHICH HAS A SOUTH BOUND STOP RIGHT OUT RIGHT OUT FRONT, IT TOOK US TO PARADISE AND WE HAD TO WALK HOME IN THE DARK. There are deals everywhere on activites. The concierge was very nice and helful, but there should be extra staff there, we had to wait in line quite a while. You will be handed coupons on the street. Food and drink are cheap downtown, $2 beer, and the Freemont St. Casino advertizes a $7.95 prime rib. On the strip prices are much higher, some outrageous. You will need plenty of water. The convenience store by Circus Circus had 2 bottles for $1, and street vendors sell it for $1. I was desperate for water and paid $5 for a small bottle in a casino. Be prepared. We loved the pool, comfortable chairs, plenty of shade. The Waves Bar and Grill had very good food at reasonable prices, awesome hamburgers. Drinks are a little pricey. Service was excellent. In a one week stay, you get one free housecleaning, day four. This worked for us. We encountered the housekeepers, Marta and Rafaela in the hallways and they always asked if we needed anything. These friendly ladies kept us supplied with anything we needed, shampoo, paper towels, etc, with a smile. What others have said about the location is true, if you want to be in the heart of the action, go elsewhere. It is also true that there is an eysore of a failed construction site across the street. However, we preferred to be in an area that was not choked with crowds and noise. Our view was partially a parking lot but we could see the mountains in the distance and at night the lights were pretty, the lit-up Stratsophere was in view. If you have this view, watch carefully and you can see people bungee-jumping from the Stratosphere in the daytime. Our biggest gripe on this trip was the fact that on the main part of the strip, there are seemingly hundreds of people in orange T-shirts trying to hand out cards that tell you that you can have a \"girl\" come to you in 20 minutes for a price. There are also trucks that drive up and down the strip advertising this with illustration. Be warned if you are bringing curious kids. I think the city should stop this sleazy practice. ONE LAST TIP, THERE ARE 4 HILTONS IN LAS VEGAS. MAKE SURE YOU SPECIFY HILTON GRAND VACATION CLUB ON THE STRIP WHEN YOU ARE OUT AND ABOUT. In summary, we loved this hotel.

We met friends there (a couple and their two kids) and had a great time! There are several things you need to know about the place, but they are not necessarily bad things. First, HGV is a vacation-rental club, somewhat like a timeshare. Our friends are members, so they got us in for a very good rate. Otherwise you can book on the usual hotel booking sites. Because we came in under our friends\u2019 membership, we received a few extra perks that may not be generally available. And we were offered to attend a sales pitch, with the promise of a dining voucher good at a number of restaurants and buffets, but there was no pressure either to attend or to purchase. Everything was done very tastefully, and we used and appreciated the dining vouchers. I don\u2019t know whether regular hotel guests are offered the sales pitch, but if they are I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not a requirement. It looked like everyone was treated with the same level of good service. You should also know that there are at least three Hilton Grand Vacations locations in Las Vegas, so be sure you correctly locate the one you booked. You should know, too, that this facility is non-smoking and non-gaming. We considered this to be a plus, since it made the location a calm, family-friendly oasis in the midst of the manic Las Vegas scene. The hotel\u2019s amenities can best be described by taking you through our typical day. Sleeping in and waking up \u201cwhenever,\u201d we would either watch television in our very comfortable bed, or open the curtains and gaze upon our northwest facing view (which included the Stratosphere tower). Once up we could either bathe in the deep tub between the bedroom and bathroom, or shower in the glass-enclosed stall. I would make coffee in the fully-equipped kitchen, and we would lounge in the spacious living room, reading, watching the other TV, or gazing at the view from there. One of the perks of the timeshare membership is a gold-member lounge offering coffee, juices, muffins, and breads in the mornings and snacks in the afternoons. Otherwise our 4-room suite\u2019s kitchen had a full-size stove, refrigerator (with icemaker), and microwave for preparing breakfast or any other meal. Dishes, pans, and utensils are also provided. A dishwasher helps with cleanup. Before too long we would meet our friends and their kids at the pool. (Swimming in June in Las Vegas is best done in the morning, the afternoon being too hot.) The lovely pool, secluded from the nearby strip, had plenty of loungers in the sun and the shade, and dual 3-1/2 foot deep pools to cool off in. A bar offered drinks, appetizers, and lunch food at fairly reasonable prices. Several barbecue grills were available for use. We enjoyed napping in our suite in the afternoon, and going out in the evening. The 15-floor parking garage was available for self-parking (normally $8/day, but waived as part of our friends\u2019 timeshare deal) or valet parking ($15/day). The garage is a short and pleasant enough walk from the hotel lobby, so retrieving the car each day was no problem. The tough part was remembering what level I parked on each time! Be sure to write yourself a note each time. After going out to eat and see the sights each evening, we always enjoyed returning to what we thought of as our little apartment. We could choose whether or not the cleaning staff would come in, and whether or not they would wash towels and linens, or leave them for the next day. All hotel staff, from front-desk check-in, to valet staff, to cleaning staff, were friendly and helpful. The extra touch is a dedicated hospitality person who helps with checking in and oversees the lounge, sometimes just simply providing good conversation and sightseeing advice. On the weekdays it was Barbara, and on the weekend it was Anne, two pleasant and caring ladies. We would (and likely will) return to the HGV when we are next in Las Vegas.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fife", "Title": "\u201cF A B U L O U S\u201d", "Author": "fabdiners", "ReviewID": "UR115367306", "Content": "We swapped from the horrid HGVC at Flamingo and were delighted with the clean modern high standard accommodation offered.

I think the stars were aligned when we were able to book this Hilton GVC on an RCI exchange and on short notice. It was a studio unit on Tower II's 27th floor with a mini kitchen (bar fridge, microwave, sink). We had an early flight into Vegas, arriving at the front desk at about 8:30am. They were able to check us in at around 10'ish. Normal check in is 4pm. TIP: They're happy to give you a pool pass while waiting and drop off your luggage at the bell desk so you're not dragging it around. There's plenty enough comfortable chairs in the lobby area, the deli downstairs, and the poolside bar/restaurant to keep you occupied or you can take a short walk to the Circus Circus/Slots-o-Fun or the McDonald's for cheaper meal if you're hungry. Resort amenities are AWESOME. I would take that bed home if I could. They have an on-site spa. The market/deli was convenient. The pool area had two pools and you can belly up to the bar for some food and drinks. The prices weren't bad on the menu either. You'd pay just as much at Applebees or other restaurant chains. The resort has 24-hour security and you can pick up a cab up-front with the valet. There are cabs a-plenty waiting for a fare. If you bring your own vehicle, they have secured parking in a multi-level parking garage behind the resort. Location was not that bad either. It is a little further north on the South Las Vegas Boulevard Strip across from the old Sahara Casino (it closed last month) and a block north of Circus Circus but the walk south wasn't bad. The weather, while hot, was actually perfect and actually mild for this time of the year in Vegas. The cab isn't worth it, in my opinion, unless you had to get someplace in a real hurry. If it's too uncomfortable to walk, ride the Deuce up and down the strip. It stops right in front of the resort. TIP: The Deuce bus (double deck and air-conditioned) is a great way to get back and forth on LVB 24/7. It makes many stops along the way from (old) Downtown LVB to Mandalay Bay. The best deal is a 3-day/72-hour unlimited pass on the city's bus system for $20 per person. We walked to the nearest ticket vending kiosk which was in front of the Fashion Place Mall to pick up our tickets. Buses accept exact change only and NO credit cards. Once again, you will get the lovely people in marketing trying to draw you into a timeshare presentation (other than gambling, that's the next big thing in Vegas) if you aren't a member yet. Lets face it, we are the reason why Paris can afford her furball purse-pet and other luxuries so please be considerate. If you don't really want to donate to the cause, just say no. They won't take offense though they will try and call you at least twice during your stay. TIP: On the other hand, if you have an entire day to spend (forget the 90 minute pitch\u2013it never happens) and the fortitude to say no to their membership, you can get some great freebies out of it. OR save your precious minutes and just go to Tix4Tonight for half price shows. There's a T4T kiosk just down the street in front of Slots-o-Fun. Also, check out Groupon or LivingSocial online for some great deals in food, spa, and attractions. Would I go back again? Oh yeah!

Had this been a just another Hilton hotel, I think I would've given it 4 stars, but seeing it was a Vacation Club, and the rooms were not cheap, I was expecting more. The hotel is located all the way on the north end of the strip, just south of the Stratosphere - so, the main hotels are quite a hike. Rent a car or use the public transportation - getting a cab was not too easy. You CANNOT walk to the heart of the strip from here. The lobby is big and bright and nicely done. Everything looks new. The staff was nice, but not overly so. Housecleaning left us a voicemail letting us know that they did not clean our room because the privacy sign was on, but that they'd come back any time if we called, which I thought was nice. The rooms are in 2 separate towers (both accessible via the lobby). We stayed in tower 2, and had a decent view of the strip, but mainly all you could see was the large lot across the street where a casino is being built. We stayed in a studio, as we expected. Thought it was clean, new, well decorated, I think it is smaller than several Hilton rooms I've stayed in at regular hotels. So, that was a bit of a disappointment. There were only 2 bath-size towels in the bathroom, which was annoying. The pool area was very nice. There's a poolside bar-grill, though we didn't eat there. At 9:30am on a Saturday morning, it was closed. Seriously? There is no other restaurant at the hotel. There is a \"market\", basically a glorified deli, but if you want real food, you either eat at the pool (though who knows when it's actually open), or you leave the hotel. Not only is self-park not included with your room (it's $8 a day), but the parking structure is a bit of a hike from the rear entrance of the hotel. And, the 1st 3 floors are reserved for valet, so you will either have to wait for an elevator or hike up/down stairs to get to and from your car. Just an FYI, there is no casino at this hotel. They do not advertise one, but I'm just reiterating this, as people may assume every hotel in Vegas has a casino.

There were no hotel buses (at least not mentioned) between the two locations. I walked there to be able to eat my breakfast, lunch or supper. The food was excellent at the Hilton. It was just the distance that was an inconvenience. A taxi cost approximately $7.00-to-$8.00 for each single leg of the trip. I was stiffed by one taxi driver driving in a circle to increase the fair. I tried to avoid using the taxi as much as possible. Mostly walked or used the buses for transportation. The cost of the buses was $7.00 for two days (exact change only). I learned this after waiting 20 minutes for a bus. I felt that the bus was the best way to go over several miles. You can walk a long distance to see much of the strip. Most of the shopping was away from this location. There was a CVS pharmacy and inexpensive gift shop (sodas, snacks, hats, T-shirts and etc) was approximately 2-to-3 blocks.

It was our third trip and second with our college-age adult children. The hotel is a time-share property and our accomodations were a one bedroom apartment with a complete kitchen (stove, refrigerator, dishes, etc.) We didn't do a lot of cooking but it was nice to be able to keep things cold and cook if we wanted. There is a shop downstairs, but a CVS pharmacy is next door and carries almost everything you would need. The property does not have a casino and we had to sit through a time-share talk, but the room was quite comfortable for 4 people. The fold-out couch was MUCH better than ours at home. The room was clean and housekeeping was very good. There is an exercise room on the bottom floor and you can print boarding passes at no cost. I suggest using the bus system \"the deuce\" for transportation to other parts of the strip. You can get a daily ticket for $7.00 and a 3-day ticket for around $14. It goes up and down Las Vegas Blvd and runs until midnight. One thing about the north end- it's not as popular, so there are not all those guys getting in your face while flipping advertisement cards for \"adult entertainment.\" Circus-Circus is great for entertaining kids if one adult will stay with them while the others play casino games. There are rides, carnival games and a high-wire act. Also, the table rates seemed to be better, according to my husband. We took a bus trip to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon via Viator. Be aware that this is a full day activity and a long ride. The bus picked us up at the hotel to take us to the actual departure point. We had to be downstairs at 5:45am, so be prepared to get up early! The driver, Paul, was very informative and tried to make our trip enjoyable. I don't think you can even describe the Grand Canyon. lt's one of those catch-your-breath experiences and well worth the trip! We saw an I-Max film that was informative while eating lunch- individual pizzas or burgers. Not gourmet, but OK-part of the fare. We got back into town around 9:30pm. We attended a Terry Fator show (ventriloquist with singing puppets.) It was great-couldn't stop laughing. It is also suitable for all ages. Get tickets in advance- it was full on Tuesday.

We were planning to go in January anyway so we took them up on the offer. We knew going in that it was a vacation club promotion but a couple of hours of my time seemed a fair price for the room. We've done many such presentations in the past. As vacation club properties go, this one is nice enough but the room, with the exception of the microwave in the kitchenette, could be any standard hotel room. It seemed a bit small to me. We were on the 32nd floor (Room 23216) with an unremarkable view of a vacant lot and the Circus Circus RV Park. My biggest gripe was that we were the furthest room from the elevators and it was quite a hike. In fact, the longer we stayed, the further it got! We were pleased to note that security seems high. We had to show our room keys to get into the building after a certain hour. I attempted to use the Business Center to print a file from my stick drive but their system doesn't provide for stick drives and none of the staff could offer a solution. There is a fee for both using the computer and printing a page. While everyone we interacted with was pleasant they just didn't seem to have the knowledge or experience to help us. The staff in the sales center were extremely pleasant, of course, and made an effort to make sure we were happy. The rest of the staff could use some training. We were disappointed with the Deli/Convenience store. The prices for a beverage were higher than the vending machines on our floor. At 9am we went down for breakfast and they had no scrambled eggs! The staff in the deli were rushed and highly stressed. The lines were getting very long. We settled for a breakfast sandwich that was nice but overpriced. The property currently has two towers and there are plans for two more. It will continue to grow and perhaps they will improve on things like dining options. Personally, I would rather stay in a casino hotel in case I get the urge to roam during the wee hours. We tend to stay out late and we like the \"action\" in a casino property. After two nights at Hilton Grand Vacations we moved to the Flamingo, as planned, for the rest of our stay. Being mid-Strip saved us on both cab fare and time. This property would be excellent for travelers wishing to avoid the noise and hubbub of the Strip as well as families with small children.

The hotel was indeed quiet, even though they were pretty full. It is absolutely spotless, and our bed was VERY comfortable. I like it when hotels put lots of pillows out, rather than having to rummage through a closet to find them. The en suite was lovely - lots of towels, very clean and modern, and more than enough space for my husband and I to get ready to go out at the same time. It would be nice if there was a mirror with even lighting, that you could do your make up in. The bathroom mirror (though huge) is quite far away as the sink space is pretty big, and the mirrors in the room have one side to the window, so it's light on one side of your face. That really is the only thing I can say about this hotel that's less than perfect! From other reviews, I can see that other people thought it odd to have to pay for parking - we visited some other hotels in Vegas, and it did seem pretty common. Living in London, it's normal here too. In Feb '11, it was $8 per day to park your own car, and \u00a311 for valet parking. There was never a problem with either, but I'd recommend parking your own car as it's quicker to get it back when you want to go out. Taxis are available quite quickly - although the valets did jump someone in front of us because they tipped! We usually tip after service, not before.... and of course we didn't after this. Lots of people here seem to moan about location - I cannot imagine why! It's at the far end of the strip, and if you wanted to, you could walk to the action in about 5-10 minutes. There is a bus that goes up and down the strip all day, and costs $7 for a 24 hour pass. I think it's \u00a33 for a single journey, but we only did the 24 hours. I liked the location, and we like to stretch our legs a bit, so it suited us. We knew that people can smoke indoors in Nevada, and this hotel is non-smoking, which is perfect. It is very strange to come from Europe, where smoking indoors (and in doorways!) is banned, to visit somewhere that smells of smoke everywhere you go! This hotel was non-smoking though, apart from a few rooms, and we were happy with this. You do get quite a few messages from the concierge about booking trips etc, but you can just delete them from the voicemail. Over here we are used to seeing the messages pop up on the TV when you turn it on in the room, so it's no more intrusive than that really. Both the gym and the pool are pretty good for a hotel.

We chose to self-park and that worked fine. The kitchenette had a microwave, refrigerator, toaster and sink. The cabinets are stocked with plates, bowls, and glassware. Eating utensils, a can opener, and a cork screw are provided. There was food stuck on the plates so we washed everything before we used it. Linens and dish detergent are provided. There are very few electrical outlets in the room that are easily accessible. The outlet near the table would have been the best one for us to use for charging our two laptops and two cell phones but the cord to the tv was stretched over to it. We discovered that the outlet behind the dresser that the tv should have been using was not working. Our room was on the 26th floor (out of 27) in Tower One. The elevators could not have been more efficient. Of course, January is probably not a high volume month. The gym has quite a variety of machines and was very nice.

We knew ahead of time that it was located quite a distance from the excitement of the strip, so we rented a car, which we were happy we did. We did negotiate that they waive the parking fee, which is $8 per day. We stayed in a studio king room, which is basically a hotel room with a microwave, small fridge and a few dishes. It was perfect for our purposes. The gym was nice and the pool area looked very nice, but the weather was too cold to take advantage of it. We found the staff to be very friendly and accomidating.

The timeshare presentation was pretty typical, nice salesman, not too pushy, etc. It was the first time we have actually considered buying into a timeshare, but ultimately decided against it. The biggest downfall of this hotel is its distance from the strip. If you are in Vegas to gamble and enjoy the main strip, this hotel is too far from the main action.

I get a call at home asking me to take them up on their great deal of a low hotel rate, $50 gift card and $15 dollar gambling chip if I go there and sit through their time share presentation. On the phone I was told some lies. First, they told me that I was getting a deep discount; just a fraction of what the room is worth. I just looked it up on the hilton website. A studio on a Thursday (the day we arrived) is only $89, so I only saved about $20 from the regular price if I had to book it myself online. The other lie was that I was told that I could cash the $15 worth of chips in for cash. Forget it. You can't. This was my biggest gripe because I don't gamble so I kept asking him on the phone about that to make sure. I hate being lied to about this stuff. The gift card is only good to use at the hotel and casino on Paradise Road and not at the hotel on the strip. That was very annoying for me that we had to use it at a different hotel in a different area. I hated going through a casino just to use the gift card! When you get to the casino on Paradise Rd, you park in a garage and they ask for $30! Make sure you tell them you are staying at the HGVC so you can park for free. The time share presentation itself was not a high pressure sales pitch and they want to make sure it is not high pressured. Someone will ask you at the end to make sure. The biggest annoyance about the presentation is that we got up and down several times. My spouse had an injury before going to Las Vegas so this was very hard on him. If you have problems with getting up and down, beware. We were out of the presentation under the 2 hour time frame. I've read in some reviews that the walk from the parking garage is far. It's not. It's a short walk from the parking stucture to the hotel. It's outdoors. The space between the parking structure and the hotel is there for one of the two towers they will be building in the future. I would rather walk through empty space than through a casino. Some have complained that you can only park from the fourth level and up, but who cares? There is an elevator in there, so what does it matter? I don't think a hotel quest should pay for parking, but unfortunately that is more the norm these days. Parking was $8 a night. The room itself was spacious enough. It was new, so that was nice. The fridge was a good size. The micro. worked good. It had a toaster and a coffee maker that I didn't use. Studios don't have washer and dryers for clothes. Lighting was very poor. Opening curtains during the day worked for the bedroom area. The kitchenette area and the bathroom area was dark. There was extra wall lighting for the table area. The shower had low pressure, but I expect that in Las Vegas because of the need to conserve water there. However, the shower head had a large leak in it. It didn't drip down; it squirted like a fountain towards the ceiling and out towards the bathroom. I would always try to turn it so at least it would shoot towards the shower wall. The man at the sales presentation had me fill out a form about it, but nobody ever called to ask about it or to fix the problem while I was there. Maybe something would have been done if I told the front desk and something like that won't keep me from staying at a hotel, anyway. That's a small problem. The TV was a large flat screen on a pivotable stand. That was nice. However, we were annoyed that the channels had no information on them to tell us what the shows were that we turned to. So be careful if you have kids. You might change the channel to an adult show and not know it. The bed itself was comfortable enough. One review I read said the mattress was hard. The mattress has a pull over, removable cushion on top, so maybe his room just had the cushion missing. We asked for more blankets, a pillow and some more sundries. Room service brought it up pretty quick. The front desk even called back to make sure we got them. I was impressed by that. However, when the maid came in to clean the room the next day, I could tell that she just rinsed off the dishes with water and didn't wash them. The front desk people were pleasant at check in/out. The lady at the Concierge was not friendly, not helpful and even a bit rude. That is the desk where the friendliest people should be; someone who is out going and wanting to help! There needs to be a change there. Some reviews complain about the walking distance to the action. I never went down to the main section of the strip, but I was told that you can rent an electric wheel chair through the Concierge. So that's an option if you don't want to walk or get a cab. The deli downstairs maybe a little pricey, but what isn't on the strip? Or any hotel for that matter. You will be able to get something to eat there for $10. The only thing that my husband purchased there was a large size brownie for $2.50. That's not a big diffence than my grocery store in my hometown. I thought the food at the CVS store next door was overpriced too. Okay, so here is my biggest complaint. I stayed there at the beginning of January. The temperature outside was in the low 50's. I can understand the hotel wanting to turn the heat on, but when I walked through the lobby, it felt like it was 85-90 degrees in there. When I mentioned it to staff, the girls said they were also hot and sweating. I figured I would turn the AC on in the room and everything would be okay. Look at the picture of the studio room on the Hilton web site. You will see the vent on the top right next to the window. The air comes out fine, but the only place you feel it is over the arm chair and the table. While I was watching TV from the arm chair, I had to wear a sweatshirt and I was wrapped up in a blanket because the air was so powerful in that one area. However, you can't turn the direction of the vent at all. The rest of the room stays warm. I had hardly any sleep the two nights because I was so hot in there and I was sweating at night even though I had the AC set at around 66-69 degrees. When I got up to eat breakfast, I had to turn the AC off because it hit me directly over the table and I was freezing there. So basically the AC only can cool the area directly in front of the window where the arm chair and table is. If you get a room like this, ask for another one. They have ones where the vent is located on the opposite wall. It's still next to the window over the table and chair, but perhaps it will hit the bed more since it is at the foot of the bed rather than the head. I don't know, but its worth a try. I'm giving this hotel a 3 because of this problem.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, England", "Title": "\u201cHilton Quality... but with timeshare hassle...\u201d", "Author": "EnglishRusty", "ReviewID": "UR91921273", "Content": "I've stayed here before so knew what to expect....

There's also a STARBUCKS on the 1st floor which was convenient when we needed our midnite dose of caffeine to keep up with the two kids who closed down the Adventuredome at Circus Circus. HGVC is perfect if you are with the kids. Circus Circus is walking distance. We purchased the 2day Vegas Power Passes which included unlimited rides at the Circus Circus Adventuredome which is basically an indoor amusement park with 25 different rides including a water ride and full on roller coaster (2 loops and 2 corkscrews!). The power pass includes all kinds of tours and other rides as well (such as the Hoover Dam, Wax Museum, the coaster at NY-NY, the Eifel Tower, etc.). We definitely got our money's worth from the passes (http://www.bestofvegas.com/Attractions/Las-Vegas-Power-Pass-Ticket/). You get $10 credit per pass at the Planet Hollywood Restaurant for each day of the pass. That was $40 a day for our family of 4 which basically paid for dinner one night and dessert the next night. If you don't want to do anything but go to Circus Circus, you can also buy unlimited passes at just Adventuredome ($27 for above 48\" in height and $17 for below 48\".) We went to the timeshare presentation...very low-key and no pressure. They gave us a $200 certificate toward a future Hilton stay (we chose Embassy Suites). They also gave us a $50 Hilton voucher and $15 in chips for their hotel across the strip. We exchanged it for $50 credit toward the Spa.

The overall price for 3 nights was $250, so certainly excellent VFM. The hotel is located right at one end of the strip near the Sahara, and about a twenty minute walk from the main action, starting with the Wynn, Encore and Treasure Island moving onto the Palazzo, Venetian, Caesar's and Bellagio (about 30 minutes walk away) The hotel is great for being in a quieter part of the strip, but is not well-located if you want to be in the thick of the action. The rooms are more of the apartment format with 1-2 bedroom suites and studios equipped with kitchens and living rooms. It has a food court which is incredibly overpriced, no restaurant and won't even provide a toothbrush without you paying for it! There are absolutely no freebies like in other hotels, the pool is quite small and the service is inconsistent. However the staff are polite though not terribly efficient or friendly, the location is not a deal-killer especially if you want to get some peace. It did not have a casino but I personally didn't mind since I was planning on playing at the more famous casinos anyway, and it means the hotel is less crowded when you get back at night. There is a monorail but single rides are surprisingly expensive and cabs are only slightly more expensive for a couple (the usual distance we travelled was between the Bellagio / Caesar's and our hotel) There were no benefits to being a Hilton Honors Gold member which was surprising since that violated the terms of Gold membership. But we didn't argue the point. Negative points to the staff member at reception for that though. The equipmentn the hotel is outdated (the handle on the drier just came off in my hand, the TVs are not flatscreen in this day and age) The really annoying thing was that the hairdryer shorted which caused a lot of inconvenience to my wife since it happend as we were just going out and didn't have time to ask for someone to come fix or replace it.

All Without a Casino!\u201d", "Author": "Genghisdon", "ReviewID": "UR73279064", "Content": "I recently stayed at this Hilton Grand Vacation property for a three day stint for work in Las Vegas. I chose this place based on previous reviews, and hoping that the casino/hotels would be the places that attracted the throngs of people I was hoping to avoid. I was quick to discover how wrong I was when I checked in. While the check-in process was efficient, the main lobby area was MOBBED with people either who were similar to me in using the place as a hotel, potential timeshare owners on a free junket, or existing timeshare owners. This situation must be a pretty regular occurrence if you consider the property has two buildings with 29 floors each that all converge in the lobby or pool area. So it was quickly apparent my chances of a quiet weekend stay were shot. The room I got was by far a really nice suite - granite counter tops, awesome bed, and spacious. However, I certainly hope my room was not one they give to visiting potential viewers, as my view was at the parking garage and a huge dirt lot filled with construction materials. To be honest, I don't think there is a way to get a room with a decent view when you look at what surrounds the area around the resort - there's the bankrupt 68 story Fountainebleau on one side (nothing like staring out the window at a deteriorating, partially constructed mega hotel), the parking garage (my view), or the side of the Sky condominium tower. The pool area, as mentioned in other reviews, was ENTIRELY too small for the number of rooms and guests the resort supports. I walked out to an area teeming with people both in and out of the pool. Again, the view from the pool are was a depressing situation, as the Fountainebleau, Sky, Circus Circus, and facility air handlers all look down on an area that in meant to be a little more serene. The final piece of my experience (which made me check out a day early) was the fact that the longer you stay, the more \"nickel and dimed\" you feel about the place. Valet parking was $13 per day (Self Parking was $8), the Waves restaurant was skewering folks at $10 for a drink, and the Marketplace was charging 3 X the price of things being sold next door at the CVS. However, walking to the CVS was challenging, since the property is not in a very nice area of the strip, so getting hit up for change was a constant part of the experience.

All four of us have been to Las Vegas many times and have stayed in various hotels over the years. We are seasoned travellers. Unlike the other reviews I have seen, we thought the beds were fine, location ok and the walls quite thick enough to keep out he noise. Our complaint was that the deluxe studio is about the size of a ship's cabin and very dark with few amenities...only 2 wine glasses, a TINY bathroom without even a fan and the partial kitchen is a very small counter across from the bathroom. I don't see how anyone could live in this room for a week! However, my main complaint is with the Time Share program. The gal that hosted us was fine but the staff at the gift desk tried to cheat us out of our promised $100 gift certificate for a Hilton hotel and $50 worth of chips. Instead, she said we were to receive a $50 certificate to the las Vegas Hilton and $15 in chips to use there. I complained and after some arguing was given a $200 Hilton gift certificate...I had to select which Hilton property I wanted and was then also the $50 and $15 in chips for th eHilton. They tried to cheat our cousins as well but I intervened on their behalf. My husband and I own two time shares and have been to several talks and have NEVER been cheated out of promised gifts.

We are Hilton Grand timeshare owners in Orlando, so we were able to use our points, then Open Season, to reserve our time here on the Strip. Because I had been suffering from high altitude illness and dehydration from my days prior to arriving in Las Vegas, I arrived at the Hilton Grand very ill. Our first impression of the hotel was fantastic. We were greeted by Robert in Bell Service, who expertly loaded nearly an entire van full of luggage onto one cart and got us safely tucked into our room. Later that evening, we met Wayne, a fantastic security guard, who gave the kids sheriff's badges. The hotel is at a perfect location, walking distance to Circus Circus, a next-door CVS, and being on the strip, taxi rides are $10-20 to every venue you would need to go to, so we never had to move our car or worry about parking elsewhere. I asked for management to call an ambulance for me the second night that I was there, as I thought at the time that I was having a heart attack. I was at Caesar's Palace, sightseeing, when my symptoms hit, and I grabbed a taxi to take me to the hospital. The taxi driver claimed not to know the way to the hospital and took me to the hotel instead. When I arrived at the hotel, I immediately saw Robert, who called the night manager, Bob and Wayne was also called, which was very comforting, since both the kids and I \"knew\" them. While we waited for the ambulance to arrive, Bob, Scott, Wayne and Robert, took care of us, calling housekeeping to bring the kids a warm blanket and directing the ambulance to us. The housekeeper came out and literally tucked the kids into the blanket. While the paramedics checked me out in the privacy of the ambulance, Robert and Wayne comforted the kids, as did Bob, and then the paramedic advised that, based on my symptoms, that I go to the nearby hospital, but informed me that Las Vegas law mandates that children under the age of 16 have to be taken into protective custody if accompanying a parent in the hospital - they cannot just stay in my room. So, I made the difficult decision to have my teen babysit my younger child in the condo, while I was taken away in an ambulance. Night manager Bob, Wayne and Robert assured me that they would get the kids to the room safely, lock them in, and check on them throughout the evening. Evening turned into a very long night for me at the hospital, and fortunately, I was able to keep tabs on the kids via cellphone from ER. The hotel management called my kids every hour, asking them if they needed water or food, and they updated my husband by phone as well. I cannot begin to tell you how invaluable it was to know that the kids were safe in this unfortunate and emergency situation. I know there are many parents out there who leave their kids in hotel rooms or even at home alone all of the time, but I am not one of those parents. I have never left even my teen alone much at home, much less a hotel in Las Vegas, but if this had to happen, thank goodness it was someplace like the Hilton Grand. We were treated like VIPs the entire time we were there, and even after I returned to the hotel room in the early hours of morning, both Wayne and Robert called at least once a day to check in on us. Wayne brought the kids Easter candy and a special gift for my youngest, and I discovered that in this big world and sometimes less than desirable reputation of Las Vegas, there are some incredibly honest and caring people. We had to extend our stay at the Hilton Grand so that I could recouperate before moving on the road, and we were comfortable and very at home. The kids enjoyed swimming in the pool, loved the convenience of the marketplace, and spent some time in the game room. I enjoyed catching up on laundry in the in-room washer/dryer and cooking a few meals in the full kitchen. Although we did eventually get to enjoy some of the sights and sounds of Las Vegas, the hospitality, honesty and impressive customer care and genuine interpersonal communication is what I will remember most about Vegas because of the care we received at the Hilton Grand. As far as the rooms, decor, etc., everything is much more beautiful when you find out you are not having a heart attack and instead severely dehydrated, but the beds, sheets and towels are top of the line, housekeeping brought us anything we needed (extra blankets, extra towels, extra toiletries, pillows, etc), and the concierge and front desk had every answer we needed at their fingertips (show times, etc.). This is a first-class hotel, and it appears to be fantastic shape, and I didn't see any problems with the furniture, bathrooms, etc. Nothing was in disrepair, fading or otherwise. I wouldn't hesitate choosing this hotel for its convenience and upscale ambiance, but overall, I highly recommend it because the management and staff are among the finest people that I have met in a long time.

Also, beware that the area surrounding Stratosphere beyond the Las Vegas Blvd can be very dangerous to walk around. We spoke to a police officer and he said as long as we walked together and stayed on the strip we would be safe, but pointed to side streets that we should avoid.

We booked our trip after getting a call from Hilton offer discounted rates to do the tour. Reluctantly, I booked the 2 nights stayed with my credit card, and was promised several gifts once completing the tour. Weeks after booking, our trip was confirmed by a timeshare representative who added a 3rd night for free since we were driving out. The hotel was nice. Check in was easy. We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite because we were celebrating our 10 year anniversary. The pool was pretty. We private rented cabanas and hung out by the pool most of our trip. We went on our 2 hour timeshare tour. We did not purchase but were still given the \"gifts\" we were promised. In January on 2010 I received a call from Hilton asking if we would like to come out again. Since construction was complete, they invited us to once again do the timeshare tour for discounted rates and gifts. So I decided to book the 2 night for my husband\u2019s birthday. Weeks later, I called to confirm the reservation, and notify them that I never received the confirmation letter in the mail. During the call the representative realized that we had been on the tour 6 months prior. She placed me on hold and came back to explain that we didn\u2019t qualify for the tour because we need to wait one year before touring again. She placed me on hold and returned to advise that we could stay at the hotel for the discounted rate, but were note eligible for the tour of gifts. I didn\u2019t try to cancel, as we already had babysitters setup for the trip. I was however discouraged to learn about this little scam they are running. Remember, they called me to have us re-tour. Upon check in during March 2010, we were referred to a marketing rep. She was very nice and offered to upgrade us to a one bedroom after hearing about the \"fast one\" that was pulled. She blamed it on a computer glitch. We checked into our room, which was very clean. The one bedroom will very comfortably sleep a family of 4. At check in, you can choose between the 2 towers, one offers a flat panel tv, the other offers jets in the room bath tub.

Our first stop was in Vegas, and we wanted a hotel where we could feel like we were at home for the three nights we stayed, and not at a casino, we wanted a place we could get away and relax after our long drive, and after having fun each night. The HGVLVS has large suites with full kitchens, and in-room laundry machines. We also picked a room with a large jacuzzi to soak in. Neither of us smokes and my wife has asthma, so we wanted a hotel that would be comfortable for us and smoke free. I did a lot of research and the Hilton Grand Vacations Las Vegas Strip seemed like the hotel for us, especially after reading the reviews from others on TripAdvisor. The reviews described this hotel accurately, and it turned into a good pick for us. I liked the cleanliness of our room and the entire hotel. Room service is regular, and not disruptive. They made sure we had everything we needed daily...including laundry soap for the in-room washer. The location is away from the traffic congestion that is regular around other hotels, largely because the resort across the street is undergoing construction which has been slow and stalled at times. The location was perfect for us because I wanted to drive all over Las Vegas and beyond at will. Having quick access to the street without traffic was great. Driving around to destinations in Las Vegas is not everyones cup of tea, but if you are a good driver, and know where you want to go, Las Vegas has free parking at almost every Casino. So if you like being behind the wheel, know the area well, or have good GPS, I suggest driving from this Hotel. You will never be late for any shows you schedule because you missed the train or the bus. The location of the HGVLVS is not in a good place if you want to walk to the best parts of the strip, or ride the expensive monorail. On our first full day and night, we drove to the Paris Casino from the Hotel, parked for free and walked all around the strip, and afterward drove back to our peaceful hotel in less than five minutes. We got ready for our show then drove to the Venetian at night to see the Phantom. So the location was great for us. There is an outdoor pool which we never used because we had so much planned, but it looked like an awesome area to swim and soak in the sun. The HGVLVS has a deli style shop near the lobby. We never ate there because we had restaurants planned and we usually ate breakfast in our kitchen, that we stocked with a few groceries. The value was excellent, if you book at the right time, you can find deals for $100.00 a night or less for an apartment style luxury room. The hotel has beauty that that rivals some of the casinos, and is worth the stay. I also must mention what disappointed us though. There needs to be better areas to unload and check in for road trippers and people planning on stocking groceries in their kitchen for extended stays. After driving through all sorts of weather and spending 12 hours in our car, I wanted to just walk into the lobby check in, and then park the car somewhere close where we could unload the car ourselves, without a bell man or valet. I don't like a bell man toting around our road tripping gear, groceries, and dirty laundry through the lobby. So I decided to park in the only parking area they have before unloading which is nearly 100 yards from the rear entrance. So I hauled all our stuff from the parking garage across an uncovered and lonely sidewalk to the hotels rear entrance at night, all due to the fact I didn't want to be seen in the elegant lobby with all my back packs, food tubs, and laundry bags. That sucked. The hotel needs a covered walkway from the garage, because if you don't use a valet your walking a football field in the elements to your car. Also because this hotel is also a time share property prepare to be 'pitched to' at some point during or even before your stay if you pre-book. You can always politely refuse the offers though. Other negatives are no full service restaurant, and no indoor pool. The positives far out weigh the negatives. I recommend this hotel for people who like to drive, people who need to stay someplace smoke free, people who have families, people who plan to have a long stay in Vegas and need a large room, people who want to get away from the action at their hotel, and people who plan to cook their own food or dine at restaurants.", "Date": "March 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scituate, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat time share hotel\u201d", "Author": "Lstenbeck", "ReviewID": "UR57953938", "Content": "Just spent a week at the Hilton grand on the strip.

It was refreshing to be in a non-smoking hotel, considering that everywhere else in Vegas seems to have no non-smoking areas. If you are a big gambler and need a casino in the lobby of the hotel, then this is not for you; however, if you don't mind going to another hotel to do your gambling and then going back to your hotel, then this is perfect. The only downside to the hotel is that it is on the less developed end of the strip, slightly farther from the action at the other end--there are fewer hotels in the area and some of the neighborhood can be a little sketchy, especially at night. Overall, it was a beautiful hotel and a great experience.

Our room had a coffee maker (Starbucks), fridge, microwave, cabinets w/utensils & plates. The room was kinda hot... air was on the coolest possible but since it was chilly outside, it kept kicking off. Comfy bed, several pillows. Flat screen tv was nice w/a dvd player (& you can rent dvds downstairs as well). Very nice cleaning people -- we preferred not to have our room cleaned, but anything that we needed they gave us. There is a cvs right next door, they have everything you need....resonable pricing as well. Nice shower/bathroom. Marketplace is downstairs, kinda pricey -- but worth trying their lunchmeat & desserts. Walking around at night where the hotel is located is kinda iffy... The Sahara is right across the street, they offer 1.00 shots 1.00 beers each night, which was pretty cool. We figured out that we could ride the monoral from the Sahara to the main strip, there are 5 stops, comes every few minutes. I would NOT bother buying a ticket for the Deuce! They are always packed to the rim & never on time arriving to the stops. Definitely go down to see the Pawn Shop (Pawn Stars)!! (Its past the Statosphere, down a bit further). We took the Deuce down which wasent bad. Monoral is 30.00 for 3 days & the Deuce is 15.00 for 3 days I believe. Depends on your preference. Goto the Paris Eiffel Tower, watch the water show from the top, see the Volcano..! I mean, all in all... The Hilton was a great hotel, I would stay there again --- no casino inside, but its nice & low key. Next year we plan on taking our daughter w/us. This hotel does not give upgrades for Diamond members, etc -- so dont bother with that unless you want to pay the extra 35.00 a night. There are two other Hiltons in Las Vegas on the strip that DO give upgrades, but we figured this was the nicest out of them all. The staff at the hotel actually sent a basket up to our room on our last day for our anniversary. Which was beyond nice of them, which was filled with all sorts of goodies & wine.

I am a regular traveler to Vegas (about once a month for the last 4 years), and I have stayed pretty much everywhere on the Strip. I came to this property because of a marketing phone call I received from Hilton HHonors (I'm an HHonors member). They initially offered me 2 nights in a studio for $199, but I told them that I know the Vegas rates very well and that is NOT a deal. Another person then got on the phone and said, \"I see that you know the rates in Vegas very well. How about 3 nights for $99?\". Ah, that's more like it. So if you ever receive a marketing call from these folks, accept it only if you are comfortable with what they are offering. By the way, I was upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite with a full kitchen---score! This is a great hotel! I was pleasantly surprised, because I have driven by here many times and I always kinda thought \"Eh...I'll never stay there\". This is mainly because of the location. It is at the north end of the Strip across from the new \"Fontainbleu\" resort which is only 70% completed, but construction is frozen due to the economy. If you have a view in that direction, you're not looking at anything special. Actually, there really is no \"view\" here no matter what room or suite you get. If you look north, you see the Stratosphere and Sahara (blah and blah!) as well as a big dirt lot. On the south side is the Skyloft Condos which block your view of the Strip. To the west is Highway 15----so don't worry about where your room is located because the view is crappy no matter what. I would have given this hotel 5 stars, but the reason I withheld a star is because of the location. I don't mean to offend anyone when I say this, but the Circus Circus (next door), the Sahara (across the street), the Riviera (also across the street), and the Stratosphere (1 block away) draw a much, much, much different clientele than, say, Wynn, Venetian, Bellagio, etc. But there is good news in the future! When the economy picks up, Fontainbleu will get completed (and it looks like it will be beautiful once they finish it), MGM-Mirage owns the dirt lot on the north side and will be building something there, I'm pretty sure the Sahara won't be around much longer because they are really hurting (buffet is permanently closed and one entire hotel tower has been shut down). So in five years or so, I think this will be a really nice area. But for now, you have to take a taxi (or the Deuce Bus located directly out front) to get to a nicer part of the Strip. Housekeeping here does a beautiful job of keeping things clean and well-maintained. I'm very picky, and i can find NOTHING to complain about. The room is spotless, the kitchen is spotless, the bathroom/shower are spotless---very , very nice. For those who are coming here for the timeshare sales pitch, ugh.........Here are my observations from it. It does not take 2 hours as advertised---mine took 3 1/2 hours. Once you finally get down to the meat and potatoes of dealing in numbers, they throw an awful lot at you. Very hard to keep track of it. Hilton Timeshares does not sell \"time\" (like Marriott does)...instead, everything is based on \"points\". They will show you different options that you can buy, but here is an example that I was given today: Pay $39,500 today and that gets you 7,000 points for life. If you pay cash, they will thrown in 8,000 more points (one-time use, not for life). If you want to convert your points to Hilton HHonors (hotel) points, the ratio is 25 to 1 (1 timeshare point equals 25 HHonors points). An example of a one week Hawaiian vacation at the Hilton Waikola on the Big Island is about 6,000 points (in the timeshare condo---not the hotel). Hilton Grand Vacations has 49 properties, and the points are the same no matter where you go. You can also stay at RCI properties (the big book where you choose non HGV properties). Any time you book a condo at an HGV property, it will cost you $49 booking fee ($59 if you do it over the phone). To book an RCI property, it will cost you $179 to book your trip. These fees apply EVERY TIME you book---for life. You also have an annual homeowner's fee, which ranges from about $780 a year to $2,200 a year. This fee **will** go up over time---guaranteed---so keep that in mind. So no matter what plan you purchase, you will be stuck with a $49 or $179 fee, plus increasing annual dues. If you reject the offer to buy, they send in a 3rd salesman (yes, they make you visit with 3 people). The 3rd guy tries to sell you a 15 month plan where you can try it out to see if you like it. This plan costs $1,395 and gives you 5,000 points that you must use in 15 months. You can use the points only in Vegas, Orlando, or Hawaii (10 specific properties). If you do end up buying after 15 months, the $1,395 will be applied to the numbers you were shown at your sales pitch. I hope this makes sense...it's lots of numbers being thrown out there and that's the quick and dirty version of how it works. As others have noted, once you say \"no\", they are no longer friendly and will show you the door---without even shaking your hand. It's like, \"Well screw you, get the heck out of here\". They didn't say that, but I sure got that impression. Sales issues aside, I highly recommend this property. Everyone here is nice, the Marketplace is open until midnight, there's a CVS next door, and it's very family oriented. Feel free to email me with any questions. Oh, and here's a big bonus---you can stay here anytime you like without being an owner.

The $100 cash/card ended up being a $100 gift certificate for a future Hilton stay, so we did not get the money back. Check-in: The people at the desk were courteous and efficient and we were quickly on our way up to our room. Location: The Hilton is on the strip next to the Stratosphere. It is at the wrong end of the strip for convenient casino hopping so you will likely want to drive. The view: We had a room facing the strip, but there was almost nothing to see because the now-defunct building across the street and the other Hilton tower block most of the view. The view are not ugly, just don't expect to look out and see the neon streets lighting up. Next was the parking. The Hilton shares a parking structure about 50 yards from the hotel and charges guests to park there. It is not an overly long walk and since the weather is nice most of the time in Vegas it should not be too inconvenient. The studio rooms are ridiculously small. Motel 6 has more space and as many conveniences. However, the usual comfortable Hilton beds were great and the room was clean. We switched to a 1-bedroom and were much happier. Nice soaking tub and big shower, and the full kitchen setup. Definitely worth the upgrade from the studio room here. Finally, the sales pitch: We didn't buy the timeshare, but did go for the trial plan they had for a stay in Orlando, Vegas or Hawaii. The 7,000 point plan is a bit pricey at $1,600 but will allow you to stay for up to 23 to 32 days in a studio, 12 to 16 days in a 1 bedroom, or at least a week in a 2 bedroom suite. Since we were planning on spending about three weeks in Orlando, we thought we could put it to good use. The salesman made a big point that if we couldn't use it, we could get a refund on everything but the interest, citing the main reason being Hilton loses money on each one of these, but hopes we will buy after we experience the trip. As it turns out, it was a lie (I know, shocker, huh?). We decided to cancel the plan, but were told it would cost $500 to cancel it. When trying to book our rooms - the salesman recommended booking Hawaii (it does seem to be a really good value there) or Vegas for New Year's Eve, however since we have now been told we can book only nine months out, it seems unlikely that the busy times will be available.

We stayed in the new Tower 2 @ mid tower. WHAT WE LIKED: * The one bedroom suite was beautiful with a full kitchen with dishes and cooking pans, coffee maker and all the other essential appliances and utensils which, we used to make our breakfast meals; no spices or cooking ingredient essentials though, you'll have to make a trip to the grocery store which is about 2 miles east on Sahara Ave; don't walk it's not worth it. * Our floor was completely non-smoking, although one evening we exited our room and it was clear that someone had been smoking in the hall or their room, it was terrible. * The grounds are pretty and it looks like they plan to expand the resort in the future. * The pool is small & nice; the outside temp was in the low 60's so several kids were having a good time in the water...which is kept at about 80 degrees. * The Deli is tasty and they have a Starbucks there too. They provide some grocery items to purchase but terribly spendy, just for convenience I guess. * The activity room was always active with kids at the pool table and the work out room equipment is excellent and open 24 hours a day. * Staff was friendly and helpful. WHAT WE DIDN'T LIKE: * No restaurant, but there is the deli and room service. * The view, boring, over looking an empty construction site, which will someday be a new wing of the resort. * Our free internet access did not work.but I didn't report it, either. * We were out most of our stay so the resort idea didn't work that great for us in LV. * We were too far away from the hub of the strip activity; the Stratosphere, Sahara and Circus Circus are the closest. * It took us a few trys to get the transportation thing worked out; double decker bus is 7.00 for as many rides within a 24 hour period but it is extremely slow, it stops at every bus stop. The monorail is a lot faster, it's 14.00 for 24 hours worth of rides but you have to walk through the Sahara to catch it, not a big deal if your feet aren't dead from walking to the grocery store. I'd recommend taxis if you have a specific destination and you don't want to walk in high heels. * It seemed as though HGV could benefit from providing a shuttle for guests to the two grocery stores east on Sahara Ave...but they do not provide one. Be prepared. * The timeshare presentation was terrible! They promised only 90 minutes at the most and we were there for 3 1/2 hours. Each time we tried to breakaway (as I was really hungry by 2:00pm) they brought in another sales person; very high pressure and the quality of the people making the sales presentations were not professional and very unorganized and disrepectful to our basic needs. Our \"sales person\" didn't know how to spell, he didn't know where several of their resort properties were located in the world and he was unaware of current events. As older patrons we respect the Hilton name and the quality of their properties and we choose specifically to patronize their properties, we know what we like and to pressure us to \"sign today\" or we won't get the deal is just cheesy. I have a different view now and I'm not sure I respect the Hilton image after what we went through. The sales manager was so unprofessional too!

The Deuce bus will take you up and down the strip unlimited times for $7 a day or simply having a rental car works well. The monorail can be picked up from across the street at the Sahara Hotel. The station is located to the back of the hotel through the casino. They are building a humongous hotel (Vdara Hotel and Spa) and a mall across the street but that may take a while to complete. A handy CVS is located right next door and a McDonalds, Subway, and Nathan\u2019s Pizza are located at the Circus-Cirucs Hotel. Parking- the parking structure is a short trek to the back of the hotel but for $5 more ($13 a day) you can have valet parking and relax in the hotel lobby until your car arrives. Regular parking is $8 per day. Bathroom- from Kohler toilets and sinks to elegant Baltic green granite countertops to an all tile shower with plenty of room for 2. I stayed in Tower 2 the slightly newer tower than tower 1. I found out that the difference between the 2 towers is that tower 1 has a jetted tub in the bathroom while tower 2 has a soaker tub and no balconies. Kitchen- Very well designed with raised full outlay, cherry kitchen cabinets and the same rich, elegant light-colored Baltic green granite countertops. A full kitchen with a full size refrigerator, oven, microwave, washer/ dryer combo, dishwasher, coffee maker, blender, and toaster are standard. Again, there is a Kohler kitchen sink and all the appliances are made by Cuisinart. Room- I had a 1-bedroom suite that had a separate king-size bed, which connected to the bathroom via a sliding door. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room had a large TV, lounge chair, and a full size mirror attached to the back of the door. Living Room- comfortable sofa and lounge chair with a flat screen TV. The sofa doubles as a full size bed that is also very comfortable and not just for kids but adults too. Dining room- a beautiful glass table with 4 chairs. Desk- a laptop nook is also nice BUT the high speed internet that is suppose to be complimentary simply sucks. I never really got a strong connection and never could surf the internet. I even had them bring me an Ethernet cable that did nothing. The girl at the front desk told me they are working on adding more data ports but that she also agreed that the high-speed wireless internet is not great. There is a big 24-hour fitness gym with free weights, treadmill and an elliptical. There is also a 24-hour game room with a pool table, big screen TV, and table tennis.

Dumbbells up to 50 lbs and curl bars up to 90 lbs. Universal machine and sliding squat/press rack as well. All in all a nice center, not too crowded at 10 am. Location is only close to the Stratosphere & Sahara (& the big huge gift shop on Sahara & LV Blvd), but there is a monorail station at the Sahara. If you have a car, the location is not a big deal since the destination casinos are easily accessible via LV Blvd and using Sahara to I-15 is usually faster for strip hotels. Check in was smooth and the room was very spacious and well appointed. We had a 3-bedroom (2 br + the lockoff unit). The 3-br units are all on floors 36-39 (top floor). We were in Tower 2, the northeastern tower (more North-South view oriented), which had a nice view of the strip (saw PH Westgate, MGM, Mandalay Bay, and then west to the Rio & Palms), but the main part of the strip was blocked by the tower on the adjacent property to the south. We could see the north view from the elevator area windows and that looked very nice as well - not blocked by anything. Interior: Granite countertops throughout. Master bath in the 2 br had a very nice touch - the spa-shower where you not only had the regular shower head, but 3 additional nozzles at chest, abdomen, and thigh-level. Living area had a pull-out. We were able to fit 8 in this unit very comfortably. The 2 br unit kitchen had large appliances - microwave, stove/oven, refrigerator with icemaker & dishwasher. You can get groceries a couple miles away to the east or west at supermarkets, and there is a Whole Foods at the new Town Square mall south of the strip.

You also take out your own trash, which is at the side opposite of the hallway from the elevators. Concerige was helpful with restaurant suggestions and was happy to try to help with tickets.

I wanted to stay off the strip and wasnt up for a casino hotel. The Hilton Grand Vacations Club seemed to be a good deal. No casino, and the price was good. Not far from the airport, short distance to the venue, though I didnt realize there was going to be so much traffic. The lobby was beautiful, with a large grand staircase. I was greeted by a man who checked my name on a list, and got me ready for check in which was rather quick. I then proceeded up to my room. This was my first time staying at a Hilton, and didnt know what to expect, but honestly, I expected a bit more out of my room. I dont know how to describe it, but will share a few pictures I took. From first glance it seemed nice, but there where a few random things around the room I noticed through the night, the room seemed very warn. I was there for 2 nights, again, not for a typical trip to Vegas. My first night was spent in and relaxing, the second day I had to be to the venue early, so not much time was spent actually in the room. I did however get to enjoy the beautiful pool area and tan a bit the second day. I noticed that chairs fill fast, so if you want to get a spot at the pool, make sure to get there early in the morning. Make a note that this hotel does not offer any sort of room service, something I did not know ahead of time. I didnt adventure much around outside the property, but am pretty sure there are not many restaurants around the hotel. There is a shop of basic foods in the lobby area, and all the rooms have a kitchen with at least a fridge, sink, dishes, microwave, coffee maker, etc. Overall it wasnt a horrible experience, but if I where to be in Vegas again, I would not be staying here. All the staff I met was extremly nice, the pool area was beautiful, the free in room wifi is always awesome, and I loved that the room had a DVD player. Those however where pretty much the best parts.

We went into it basically for a \"free\" anniversary place to go since funds are tight. After reading some of the reviews before we left, I was very scared although a friend of mine had just been to the new one in Orlando and loved it. It is a beautiful hotel and the staff couldn't be more attentive and helpful. We stayed in tower two in a one-room suite and it was large with a full kitchen/laundry, dining room, livingroom with flat-screen t.v. with Bose sound system, king-size bedroom with a two-person tub right next to it and another flat-screen t.v., and a large bathroom with granite/marble countertops. Although upon arrival, the maintenance guy was fixing the dishwasher, he left shortly after we arrived and apologized for not being done already. The bed was very comfortable and it was a treat to travel and have a bed as good as our own (we have a very expensive matress from Ethan Allen and high-end duvet, linens, etc.). I would agree with the reviews that it is at the undesirable end of the strip near all the older hotels (Circus Circus, Sahara, Riveria, etc.), but there is a new one that will be done soon across the street and it looks very high end. Hilton is building two new towers in the near future and there will be a huge new hotel/casino complex between this hotel and Circus Circus once the economy turns around. It was nice to know that not every \"Joe Schmoe\" off the strip can walk into the hotel and as one reviewer noted, they will/may check to see that you have a room key later into the night (which I did not mind at all). We didn't get to spend much time at the pool, but when we did, it was as big as other larger casinos I've stayed (Treasure Island, Rio, MGM, New York/New York). Prices for snack items/food were high inside the hotel, but there is a CVS next door (although their prices weren't much better). If I were to stay here again and if we stayed a week instead of 3 days/2 nights, I would go get some groceries and utilize the kitchen a little more (at least for breakfast and lunch)...although I don't think you should have to cook on vacation...especially in the land of buffets! Note: DO NOT got to the buffet at Sahara...I wouldn't feed my dog the stuff they had there and it smelled! Overall--the Hilton Grand Vacation Club is great for couples wanting to gamble a little (easy walk or bus/tram), get away from it all and get great airfare and great weather. For going to the timeshare demo, we received $50 to be used at the Hilton Convention Center just east of our hotel (easy walk...but not in high heels) and ate at T.J. Steakhouse.

Overall , not a bad stay the only main drawbacks being that i would find it hard to recommend if you have children and the locaton - there is a large amount of development going on around the area which is not eye pleasing also creating large areas of wasteland to walk past which also sadly seems to attract vagrants which can be annoying and the last thing - if Vegas is busy , it can take forever to get around.

The Hilton Grand Vacation is not an ultra-glamorous hotel, but its very nice and I really enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere.

I believe it was the late check-in that led to us being put in a 2-bedroom room in Tower 1 that was wheelchair-accessible. The main problem with this room setup, besides not having a washer/dryer setup, is that the second bathroom has no counters to set toiletries on! In addition to this, the shower was a \"wheel-in\" shower and allowed water to run across the bathroom floor, which is annoying at best and a slipping hazard at worst. I'm glad they have these accessible rooms for those that need them, but it was an inconvenience for us. Be aware that if you are placed in a room of this type, you might have to deal with some different stuff than you're used to. Besides this, the HGVC worked out great again! The resort was in good shape, well kept up and safe. Almost every employee we ran across was friendly, making eye contact and saying hello or asking if there was anything they could do for us. We were on the 27th floor of Tower 1, in room 12704. Everything was in decent shape in the room, and it all was nice and clean. We had housekeeping skip us the first day, and left them a couple dollars on the second day. I believe that this is money well spent for the person that is cleaning up after your mess! We weren't shorted any towels, shampoo, soap, etc and the dishes we had used were in the dishwasher, cleaned and ready for our additional use. Our room faced the pool area, the residential condo tower next door, the parking garage, and further out was the Circus Circus property. Looking beyond all that you could see the Trump tower and T.I. (even saw the \"cannon blasts\" and smoke from the battle out front). We didn't notice noise from outside or from other rooms, except the occasional door slamming. We'd definitely stay here again, and in fact will be returning in November! TIP: For those with a vehicle, there's a Trader Joe's grocery store just about 3 1/2 miles West on Sahara, then just North on Decatur (2101 S Decatur Blvd #25). Depending on traffic, it's a 5 - 10 minute drive. It's a great place to pick up groceries for you kitchen in the condo! We like to grab a few bottles of wine, some cheese and crackers and fruit to have on hand before going to dinner so we don't need to order any more than the entree!

We enjoyed our stay at the HGVC on the LV Strip May 24-30. The location makes it suitable for visitors wanting to be on the scene, but not in the mix. We exchanged through RCI for a two-bedroom suite, which contained everything we want while on vacation: full kitchen, washer & dryer (stacked, not full size), flat-screen TVs in bedrooms & living room, & free (reliable!) wi-fi. Our first suite reeked of cigarette smoke. We gave it one night & requested a move to something that afforded a more pleasant breathing experience \u2013 the desk agent pleasantly made the transaction without question. Unfortunately I don\u2019t remember which floor we nearly suffocated on (I think it was 20), but I do know it was below a smoking floor. So if you don\u2019t want a smoky non-smoking room, just ask for a room on a floor neither above nor below the smoking floor. Unlike other reviewers, we did not encounter problems with uncomfortable beds, dirty toilets, noisy neighbors, construction issues or loud pool music. I will agree with the reviewer who mentioned the understaffed pool bar. However, a refreshing margarita under the hot desert sun is worth a 10-minute wait. I would suggest hitting the pool by 9 a.m. if you want a good spot. Pool restroom was clean, which was a huge plus for my cootiephobia. We took a cab to Albertson\u2019s (2575 S. Maryland Parkway) to load the kitchen up for the week. Cab ride was $12 each way. For shorter stays, I suggest the little market in the hotel or the CVS a few blocks away. For a gambling fix, the Sahara is a 5-minute walk north. We enjoyed our stay at this property, but we probably would not stay there again because of the location. We go to Vegas to party, so being on the scene AND in the mix is key.

We thought the location on the strip would be convenient, but it was not. The building is surrounded mostly by construction and you are rather isolated. You can walk to the Stratosphere or to the Sahara Casinos. The hotel has no shuttle to the airport or anywhere. The room itself was quite nice. It had a full kitchen, a king size bed and a jacuzzi bathtub. However maid service was a little lacking and careless. We found all sorts of chip bags and chocolate bar wrappers on the sofa- not under the seat cushions but just behind the loose cushions. We seemed to always be shorted on shampoo or soap or towels and would have to wait hours and hours to get anything. Although the room looked nice and had all the amenities, the bed was a lower end bed (not the standard Hilton seems to use in most of it's hotels). The bed was not particularly comfortable and the bedding was something you would expect in a 2 star hotel. The view from the room was of construction-on all sides. When we booked at this hotel there was no mention through our timeshare or through the hotel that there was any on-going construction. Construction is carried on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, unless the weather doesn't allow for it (high winds). The noise from the construction is enough to drive you to madness as you will spend your night and day listening to the beeping of trucks as they back up to load and unload materials, as well as the general banging that goes on during construction. We were first assigned to a room in Tower A (facing the strip and towards the newer part of the strip). We asked to have our room moved and were moved to a room in Tower B where we faced the Stratosphere and could look towards the mountains. Tower A faced the main part where the construction was happening. Tower B faced the storage area for the construction material and trucks. As we noticed the construction when we checked in and inquired about it, we were ensured that the noise did not bother the guests as they had had no complaints. They were wrong. When we requested to move rooms, the front desk was very accomodating and we were told we would be moved to another room that would not be bothered by the construction. They were wrong again. When we went to them a third time to discuss the issue, we were told that others (including a Hilton manager that was staying there for a meeting) had also complained. Eventually we were able to arrange a transfer to one of the other Hiltons, however by this time we had lost about 4 days of our week's vacation-time spent packing and unpacking as we moved from room to room and then from hotel to hotel. We had had no sleep and were stressed out from having to deal with the hotel as well as our timeshare company. We would recommend this hotel once all the construction surrounding it is complete. It is nice enough, though for the time being it is removed from most of the action on the strip. The pool areas is nice (though the pools were not heated so it was too cold to use them in March). There is a little deli and market in the basement where you can buy some basic grocerieds (reasonably priced, considering) or you can order sandwiches, salads, etc. However, a restaurant on or near the premises would be nice.

We got a one bedroom suite which was very well equipped. The room has a full kitchen, washer and dryer, and two tv's. Parking is a huge frustration - they will valet your car for you but since it was full of expensive equipement we didn't feel comfortable giving the keys to someone so we opted to self park. The parking lot is around the corner and halfway down the next block - it is cramped - poorly lit - and filthy! When you come out of the parking garage you have to walk in the alley to get back to the door of the hotel. The parking situation is enough to keep me from coming back alone.

First impression #1: This property is not near ANYTHING. Technically, it is on the Strip. But, so is the Westward Ho, the Stratosphere, and I'm sure things that are a mile north of that. While it's technically on the strip, it is so far from anything fun. There can't be a good restaurant or show within a good mile and a half and the closest casinos (Sahara, Stratosphere, Rivera, and Circus Circus are all very cheesy. While the property is relatively close to the monorail (a couple of blocks to the back side of the Sahara), it's still far from convenient. Plus, this is going to add another $8-$12 per day or more to your stay depending on your monorail usage and package. Of course, this is cheaper than cabbing it everywhere. The location here really is awful if you want to leave the property at all. Of course, part of the fun of Vegas is to go out and have fun. If you don't want to get out and see Vegas, why are you even there? Maybe location is ok for a convention traveler. First impression #2: At check in, the front desk attendant didn't even look up. She just seemed cold and impersonal. She asked for my id and credit card. I took out my license from my wallet and it took me like two seconds to find my credit card and she was all over me, \"I will need your credit card, sir\". Um, if you would look up, you would see that I already had it in my hand and was about to give it to you. Just kind of rude which you honestly don't expect at a Hilton property from a front desk attendant. The service at the property was hit or miss. I'd say maybe a third of the workers seemed nice and would greet you in the hall. The others, really not so much. Overall, just not a warm feeling from anyone. First impression #3: So we check into the room. We are in a studio in Tower 1, which I guess I wish I would have read some of the reviews here first. The room is tiny. Small bath, pretty tight all the way around. Then, we hit the bathroom. I am not making this up. There are little poop marks in the toilet and pubic hairs on the rim of the bowl. The wife goes to use a shelf in the bathroom vanity only to find that it is covered with dust. The paint is peeling along the ceiling of the bathroom. I honestly felt like we were staying in an old Travellodge or something (not to hurt their name or reputation). This was supposed to be in a Hilton property. Fourth impression: Upon return to the hotel on my first night, we are stopped by security to ask to see our room keys. Other guests walked straight in from the street, but we were right with them and we got stopped. We had just returned from a nice dinner and were dressed up so it wasn't like we were homeless people trying to sneak in. I understand that there is always a concern about safety and I appreciate that. But, if you are going to stop people at the front door to the hotel, then stop everyone. I felt like a criminal for going to my hotel. Fifth impression: It's late and we're tired, but we can hear our neighbors like they are in our room. I'm not sure if they're across the hall, but most likely through the connecting door to the next room. The walls are ridiculously thin. The neighbors weren't being loud or anything; just talking at normal levels. But, the wife and I could hear them as we lay in bed the same as if they were having a conversation in our room. All in all, a pretty disappointing day and this is only my first day! Day two: The big sales meeting. I had been offered these rooms for a decent rate over the phone some months back and knowing that the wife and I planned to visit Vegas anyway, I thought that we were given a good rate to stay on the strip, and after a quick look on TripAdvisor, the hotel seemed to be rated pretty high so I took the offer. Part of the offer was that we would need to sit through a 60-90 minute sales presentation on the HGVC and after that, we would receive a hotel voucher for another night's stay at a Hilton property and $50 in gaming chips. What a complete waste of MY vacation time! I feel sorry for anyone that has ever had to endure that bunch of bs and I feel even more sorry for anyone conned into buying one of these things. The individual presentation (just me and my wife with our own high pressure sales guy, Chris) started off well enough with a little chit chat and questions about our past vacationing and our annual vacation budget. Then, the pitch. Why spend a total of $XXX,XXX over the next 30 years of vacations and just throw that money away when you can spend that same money today on a deed that will be your for life and where you could stay in hotels you would have never stayed in before? Chris, our sales guy, said about 100 times, \"Sounds great, doesn't it?\" Fact is, my wife and I both have finance degrees and I work in finance. His little sales analysis (they show you some numbers) was so off in so many ways. He tries to get you to spend as much on a new deed (for just hotels) as you're currently spending on total vacation expenditures (hotel + air + food + everything else). The sales talk neglects the time value of money. They really try to avoid bringing in the $1500/year maintenance charges and all of the costs for booking, converting points, rolling over points, etc. After a good two hours of this, he still hasn't given us the cost. The presentation was supposed to last a total of 90 minutes. We finally get the cost (something like $55k). Oh really? Oh, I can finance for 17%? Only 10% down? Oh really? Oh, and today only, $12k off since we're really trying to get sales through by the end of the month. After another 30 minutes, we get the manager to stop by with the additional push. Once they get us to the point where we're upset and definitely not buying right now without further analysis (which I can do in my head a little to know that the numbers aren't even close to working out), our sales guy Chris gets mad, the manager gets mad and they both pretty much stomp off like a whiney 5-year old. Then of course, we get the Relationship manager to come over and do a survey of how things went and our impression of our sales guy. Of course, the relationship guy also tries to sell us smaller versions of the plan and even some ridiculously expensive option to try the plan for a year. We say no (for about the 500th time). Then, we get sent off to the rewards center to pay us our crummy reward for sitting through that hell. We get a gaming voucher for the Hilton. Fortunately, we already had a pass for the monorail, because it is a really long walk to the Hilton. Plus, they can only give you chips; they can't give you cash. Well, I wasn't giving them another dime so I had the wife bring the chips back to the cage to get cash. Just a ridiculous amount of work to try to get my $50 for sitting through 3 hours of hell. One note on the value of these points: there is a HGVC deed for sale on ebay right now in which the current bid (2 days left on auction) is about 1/10th the cost of the offer we received. I could go on and on as to why this is such a bad deal financially for anyone. Please contact me with questions on this. Finally, we got done with our presentation. I apologized to the wife about 100 times for staying at this property and for putting her through such hell. There was a point where she almost got up and just walked out. I felt so bad about this place. Anyway, the rest of the stay went without incident. The pool was tight, but ok. The workout room was nicely equipped, but way too small for the usage there. The little gift shop made a nice sandwich, but prices were unreal on some of the things. My hard lime drink marked at $4.95 on the bottle was actually wrong up at $6.00 each. The pool bar made a decent cocktail. Our bathroom was properly cleaned on our second day. All in all, the place was more Holiday Inn Express or Hampton Inn than Hilton in my opinion. It is possible that all of the good reviews here are from people staying in tower 2. That is where they brought us for a tour of a unit which was very nicely equipped. The bigger one and two bedroom units were VERY nice compared to our little dirty room. Either way though, the location sucks, the service was pretty cold and impersonal, our room on arrival was dirty, and the walls were thin. Can't imagine why ANYONE would ever stay here.

This is a good place to go if you want to be in a quieter part of the strip, don't mind walking to get to a casino, and are okay with the pool bar as being your sole source of quick eats (otherwise, you have to leave the hotel to get some food).

We had a nice size kitchen, dinette, small den, fairly small bathroom and bedroom, but we did have a King size bed. The pools were wonderful! A little bar and grill by the pool. Small deli/coffee shop/store with extremely overpriced foods. However, the coffee and tea were great! A cab ride down to the main area of the Vegas strip cost us around $15. Discovered a wonderful diner called The Peppermill, within walking distance. Directly across the street from The Stratosphere. A pharmacy was also within walking distance where you could buy much less expensive beverages and snacks to take back to your room. The location is not in the heart of the strip, but at the end of it. Close enough for comfort and it was nice to get away from the mobs.

Planned to do a little gambling, but not much. More to see the sites, as our 15 yr old son was also with us. Room was perfect - 2 bedroom suite with kitchen. We ended up with this \"deal\" due to a phone call from the Hilton and sold us on the deal because of price, and the two bedroom, we jumped at it. Had to sit thru a 2 hr timeshare presentation. Didn't feel it was too high pressured and didn't opt to purchase. Room met all our needs. Pool was nice, but get there early to get a lounge chair. However, I would say, to get anywhere on the strip, you had to go to the Sahara to catch the monorail. Was inconvenient I guess. We are a pretty active family, but it did wear on is after awhile, walking and walking. Just took up too much of our 4 day precious time. Anyone who thinks they can go to Vegas without walking is not being realistic. You have to walk. Heck just to get thru one casino is quite a bit of traveling. I would recommend this hotel to families who want a nice hotel for value with a nice pool. However the timeshare was right in the middle of our vacation and took up valuable time. If you don't want to spend too much time on the strip this hotel is great. I had researched the hotel on Trip Advisor and learned there was a CVS pharmacy right around the corner. When we got to the hotel, we walked around the corner and \"loaded up\" on cereal, milk, sandwich fixings, beverages (beer, juice, etc.) which was very smart. Just ask at the front desk how to get there. Buying at CVS is better than the expensive Market in the hotel. I think next time we travel as a family, we won't go to Las Vegas until the 15 yr old is old enough. Truly, he was bored. Little kids would find the \"free\" exhibits thrilling, but teens that age probably shouldn't witness the night life, if you know what I mean. Walking down the strip at 10 p.m.... well, let's just say you see a lot of plastic, fake and skin. We were just glad to spend time in the hotel with our kids.

Poolside bar was good but there is only one wait staff helping the pool and she only did food. Not a big deal but I like to have my drinks delivered to my chair. The chicken quesadillas were excellent! Breakfast at the pool side restaurant was ok but not great by any means. The pool area was too shady so prime sun time is only a few hours. Not enough chairs for the number of guests so had to get lucky to get a decent chaise. The gym was very small and inadequate. Had to wait for machines. I am used to higher level places where one would never wait for a machine at the gym. I was there about 7:00 AM and it was already busy two days. I went for a nice run down the strip the other day which was awesome at 7:00 AM. The location is about 1 mile to the big mile at, what I consider to be, the \"end\" of the strip. So it's always a walk or a cab ride. Not a huge deal but I prefer to be in the heart of things. It's a bit sketchy walking back late at night so cab mandatory in my opinion. The service was good overall and the store downstairs had what you need. Only one computer with free boarding pass check in made for a short line.

Check-in was quite easy, and although we were offered to take a tour of the timeshare property (compensation would be $40 per person and a dinner voucher) we politely declined and there was absolutely no pressure.

Full kitchen with dining room table and four chairs, washer/dryer, adjoining living room with very comfortable couch, chair and ottoman, two bedrooms each with a queen bed and TV and bathroom. The second bedroom is a lock-off with its own little mini kitchen. The master bath is huge and has a jacuzzi tub. We love this place!

The gym/fitness area was great, and worth a stop in there every morning to wear off the buffet bulge from the previous evening. The check in folks were great, even allowed us to check in early, as our flights got into Vegas around 10AM, and we checked in around noon! Rooms were great, full kitchen etc and great views of Vegas. We went and got groceries for the week and cooked breakfast everyday, then ate at restaurants in the evenings. Saved a good chunk of money! We asked all around for what shows were good. We asked before we left, and people who had been before etc, and everyone said you gotta see Blue Man Group. NOPE! No way, dont do it. Dumbest show on the strip. We thought we won the lottery... even though we were time share owners already we went for a 60 minute presentation with HGVC and so did our family. By doing so we all got Blue Man Group tickets for only $25, saving us $75 each. SO we went to the show thinking we had hit the jackpot to be able to get great tickets for an amazing show. WRONG. Should have taken the casino chips they were offering instead. What a terrible show...... anyhow, back to the hotel.... they DID NOT pester us for their timeshares. In fact we had to seek them out to get a visit in. Their staff were amazing to deal with. Once we walked the strip, EVERY corner has a vendor trying to give you a pitch to their timeshares. It was so annoying. I hated it. I hated them and the kids on the strip tapping their porno business cards and shoving them in our face al day long. Back to the hotel.... again great set up for a lounge area, great location with a bus stop roght in front of the hotel. But get on the Duece before 4PM or you will wait a long time because they will just drive by you when full. If you are in a hurry, cross the street to the Sahara and get on the Monorail, you will be at the other end of the strip in 10 minutes!!! The best show in vegas is Cirq de solei 'O' IT is a must see! Hungry and want lots of food for great price, the Nascar Restaraunt across the street at the Sahara...great prices and so much food. In fact, keep your bus ticket from the Duece, go to the Cash Counter at the Sahara and they will validate it for you and then take it to the Nascar area and get a free appetizer....worth about $8 and is enough food to count as a meal!!!! The construction across the street...no issues at all. Our room looked right at the new building and we did not hear anything from them all week long. Folks complaining about walking i Vegas, should not go to Vegas, cause you are going to have to walk. Either form bus stop to stop, or to monorail, or to the parking lot etc..... you need good shoes, and strong legs.....and a knowledge that you will walk lots. I did not like the cost of iinternet in the business centre either. HGVC should own that and not outsource it to an outside firm that gouges their customers. But the internet in the rooms was free if you had a laptop. Also, the PLanet Hollywood Buffet is the best. The atmosphere is blah, but the food is AMAZING. The second best buffet is the PARIS, amazing atmosphere like a street cafe in Paris, and the food was good. $24.99 in both places, but all you can eat crab legs, king shrimp, prime rib, steak, lamb, turkey, veal, etc etc etc.... well worth it. Overall, I would not come back to Vegas, once you have seen it, the lustre wears off. For a one time visit it was OK.

The property is at the far north end of the strip, near the Sahara and Stratosphere Tower. Personally, I prefer to be near the action at Flamingo Rd, where the Bellegio and Caesar's Palace is located. The traffic on the strip can be a nightmare, so not being close is a pain. This being a timeshare property, they have studio, one, two and three bedroom units. I received a studio room and it is about the size of an average hotel room. It was in Tower 2, which is the newer building. There will eventually be a total of four towers. The room was bright, clean and new, with flat panel TV ( Tower 1 does not have the flat panel), DVD, small table with 2 chairs, lounge chair, king bed, small bathroom and \"kichenette\" ( microwave, undercounter refrigerator, sink, toaster, coffee maker, dishware for 2 ). Personally, if I was here (even by myself) for a week, it would be too small. I loved the Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries, but I was disappointed that robes were not provided. There was in room safe and closet with enough hangers. The towels were plush and the bed was comfortable with nice linens. The property has wireless internet and computers ( for a charge) in the Business Center. The Activity Center has computer for printing out boarding passes for free, ping pong, large screen TV, pool table, books. There is DVD rental, ATM, Fitness Center (24/7) and laundry facilities ( no charge) on site. The Spa looked appealing and for $10 day use fee, you get robe, use of steam room, and relaxation lounge with beverages. The treatment prices were about average and it's convienient to have a spa facility on site. The pool was ok size with the Waves poolside bar and restaurant. I have to say the service was poor. I was sitting by the pool, never got any attention and flagged someone down to request a menu, they never came back. The Marketplace is adjacent to the pool and has a deli, drinks, snacks and packaged food for sale. I walked in there to buy my sandwich and brought it back out to eat at the pool. It is open til 1 am, so it is a great amenity. There are Cabanas for rent, two whirlpool spas, BBQ grills and eating area and seemed to be enough lounge chairs and towels. There were two lifeguards on duty, which is a good idea with all the kids there. There were 39 floors and I was on the 4th floor overlooking the trash and air vents. My car was parked on a higher floor than me! The walls are very thin and I could hear every word the couple in the room next door said. The trash pick up came at night and the noise was also disturbing. Everywhere in Vegas, parking is free ( even valet ) except at the Hilton Grand Vacation Club. Self park is $8 and Valet is $13. If you self park, you have to park on level 4 or higher, then you have to trek to the bldg. There is really nothing close to this property, except the CVS pharmacy next door ( which is nice to have), so you are forced to rent a car or cab it everywhere. The sales presentation was what is to be expected. Obviously, they want you to purchase a timeshare, but I already am an owner with Starwood and I think that its a better program than what the Hilton has to offer. Although, the upcoming new Hilton timeshare property in New York City on West 57th and 6th Ave, sparked my interest (unfortunately, it's very expensive with high annual maintenance fee).

We were also able to pack much lighter as I did a load or two of laundry every day to keep us in clean clothes. There is also a small dining area and decent sized living room with a large flat screen TV and DVD system. All of the furniture was very comfortable.

The beds were very comfortable and everything was very clean. I called on a number of occasion for additional towels and toiletries and they were brought to our room immediately. They don't provide daily housekeeping. I wish they would as we've been to other timeshares that have it. Otherwise, you are responsible for making the beds and keeping the area clean. The hotel is a bit off the strip and not really within walking distance of any of the better casinos. We had a rented car, so this wasn't too much of a problem. The valet fee went up to $15, which I thought was high considering that you tip the valets whenever you go to either park the car or retrieve it. It does start to add up. My husband and I used the spa for massages. The spa itself is compact and very clean. The steam room is fantastic with nice showers nearby. The massages were well done. What we especially liked is that the price they quoted us included the gratuity and all of the taxes. That was a nice change as we're accustomed to having all kinds of charges tacked on.

I couldn't have been more embarassed! When there in August, we found the suite in Tower Two (Which they make a big deal of telling you: \"OH! You're in the newest Tower!\") to be amazing for the price. Nowhere else on the strip could you find a one bedroom suite that sleeps 4 comfortably with plenty of room to relax and complete with a full kitchen for under $200. I could have been (and was to a certain degree) a spokesperson for them. The rooms were brand new, and a great value. Unlike the old strip, these rooms have never been smoked in. They're not old smoking rooms which have been converted. They are honest to goodness non smoking rooms. However...this time I was shocked to find that the carpet in my room was not only stained in several places, but worn clean through to the point that it was torn! The moulding around the door in the bathroom was warped so badly, that it was curling up from the floor, and the paint was coming off. The funny part was, they convinced my collegue and I to do an abbreviated version of the time share tour. (They claim it's not time share...but it's time share...\"deeded\" or not, it's a timeshare). In the midst of her speech, the sales woman was telling us that our $865 maintenance fees assured us that each of the properties were maintained to the highest standards, and that we could expect the same quality no matter where we travelled. At that point, I allerted her to the shoddy state of my own suite. She put on a good \"shocked\" face, and assured me she would have me moved, and send someone up to inspect the state of the room. Of course that never happened! The 90 minute tour garuntees you $100 in credit to resteraunts or gaming, or shows. The 15 minute tour only gets you a fraction off of ticket prices. Well, we were told that our time was valuable and it would only take 15 minutes. We FINALLY cut her off after ONE HOUR. Still, we were only offered the 15% off of show tickets. Then, as if we were fools, the tickets they offered us at discount prices, were MORE EXPENSIVE than if you purchased them yourself from the Venue!!!! Both my collegue and I were very insulted. Not to mention ANGRY that they had taken one hour instead of the quoted 15 minutes of our time. Perhaps the most frustrating part of the week, was that we had a strip view. It did, however come with a cost!!! They are doing construction directly across the street. The windows haven't been cleaned in what looks like a year or two, and the construction dust has made them FILTHY! So bad in our suite that it actually impeded your Strip View for all of the grime. And the construction goes on 24/7. Everyone we spoke to was awakened EVERY NIGHT around 2 or 3am by the beeping and banging of construction vehicles. Doesn't make for a peaceful nights sleep regardless of how comfortable the bedding is. In my opinion (which was shared by many others), Hilton should have notified it's guests that there was construction going on. I understand that they want to make money, but they've just lost some repeat business as far as we're concerned. Now there are a few positives. The cleaning staff is fantastic. Friendly and professional and willing to go above and beyond to meet your needs to the best of their ability. The workout room is perfcect for when you're on travel. Nothing fancy, but plenty of cardio machines and a few weight stations to work the muscles. The hot tub and pool are open year round which is nice. The CVS is within walking distance (right next door) to grab a few groceries instead of paying the outrageous resort prices for food on property. As wonderful a value as it may seem for the strip, don't be lurred in. The suites are shoddy, the timeshare folks think they are above you, and if this property is indicative of how they maintain their others, who would want to throw their money away in this \"investment\"?

The resort provides two packages of premeasurd Starbuck coffee that are enclosed in their own filter.

And there is a washer/dryer with detergeant. That was fantastic. We actually did a load while we there. ambiance- very nice. There was no smokey, noisey casino to walk through.

Well, like others have mentioned the parking lot is a bit of a hike. But it didn't bother us too much. Restaurants...yeah, just the little market place, which was okay, a little overpriced, but convenient. Location. This wasn't really a bad for us. We liked being on the strip, but not in the center. But if you are looking for the \"central\" strip, near the Bellagio and such, it is about a 30 minute walk. And it's not a very nice walk. There is a lot of construction going on, and beggars and such, but it is Vegas after all. I recommend buying the $5 bus pass. The double decker bus makes lots of stops, runs frequently and it's a fun way to sight see; however it does take a long time to get from point A to point B, so don't use it if you're in a hurry.

The hotel staff was mostly helpful and polite, and the room was surprisingly large and comfortable, and had a decent wi-fi signal for my computer (no extra charge). There was also a computer room downstairs all set up to print boarding passes, a nice thing to have the night before departure. The restaurant next to the pool and bar were less than ordinary.

Was initially disappointed -- as I thought we were at the HVC property at the Flamingo -- but overall, it turned out pretty well. Being in Hilton's newest property turned out to be a good thing. Rooms As most of the reviews state, rooms are spacious and decently put together. Overall, I was very pleased and would generally agree with most of the the reviews posted. We were in a 2 bedroom suite. Couple of things I will point out, as to me, the little things are what make a difference in a place with so many lodging options. - Kitchens are well stocked with dishes / pots / appliances - Beds very comfortable - Temperature a little hard to regulate -- your options are a dial that says warmer / cooler. Between rooms, setting the dial in the same place doesn't produce the same temperature. - We had some housekeeping issues in one of the bathrooms -- when you first check in, you expect clean which we didn't get. - I know it's a desert, and there's lots of construction going on, but i really didn't expect windows that were so dirty from the outside that you couldn't take a clear picture at any time of the day. - There wasn't a single notepad / pen in the unit. Ever try to work out dinner reservations / shows without something to write on / with? Front Desk / Staff Nice, although staff was a bit stuffy on checkin. When we asked about a late checkout (which normally doesn't happen with timeshares) we got what we wanted. However, the staff member didn't think to fix our keys so we had to return to the lobby to have the keys redone. Market Nice to have this right there -- coffee, beverages, snacks, etc. High prices, but if you don't want to venture out, it's right there. You get better prices next door at the CVS. Concierge Apparently, Hilton contracts this out to Las Vegas Concierge. In my mind, this was the area in most need of improvement. They were slow and unprofessional. There were 4 different conversations going on while we were being helped. I can't think of a single reason that it should take 35 minutes to issue a pair of tickets when there are 3 people working a desk and no more than 2 parties at the desk at one time. I was initially really surprised that Hilton would accept this --- when I realized it was contracted out -- I was even more surprised that they'd let something like that potentially impact customer impressions of them. Facilities -- Nicely laid out pool and hot tub -- although we didn't get to use as it was cold.... Nice size workout room, lots of equipment, and multiples of everything -- which is a good thing as it is always busy up til noon. The spa looked nice, but the prices were high enough to discourage us from taking part. I didn't expect to find prices on par with the big names on the strip. Transportation / Safety -- We didn't rent a car. We did the 3 Day $28 monorail pass and it worked really well for us. It's less than a 10 minute walk down to the Sahara and through the casino to the monorail. There is a light with pedestrian signals to cross at. When we initially saw all the construction, we were a little worried about walking to the Sahara and back from the monorail at night from a safety perspective, but once we'd done it, we didn't worry anymore and had no issues. Some evenings we opted for a taxi instead and that worked well. Overall Nice property. Nice way to get away from the craziness of the casinos while still being on the strip. Much more convenient than the off strip timeshares.

It was a great deal working that directly through him. The hotel was outstanding. From the friendly staff, to the excellent and comfortable rooms, to the great pool area and snack bar, to the in-hotel convenience store/fast-food facility, you name it...it was excellent. Free Wi-Fi internet access, too. It's a fairly new facility, so not much wear and tear yet. Saw the GM one day really checking out the pool area and talking with staff individually apprently to remind them to pick up towels, etc., etc.; definitely a quest and concern for excellence and cleanliness. The place was spotless. The only negative is that you are a bit in no man's land in terms of location on the Strip, kind of between the new hotels/casinos on the one end and the older downtown/Freemont Street action on the other. This hotel itself does not have entertainment or casino on-site. It's really set up more as a family resort it seems. So if you want to catch the shows, etc. or visit the newer casinos, or for that matter visit the Freemont Street Experience (definitely worth it, by the way) you have to either really walk quite a distance (not easy in the summer heat!), or catch a cab or the convenient public bus that runs up and down the Strip. If you time it right and you're heading in that direction, there is a free bus from the Wynn resort that stops right at the door and takes you to that end of things from which you can then journey on as you wish. There is also a monorail system that you can travel by, but again, it's a bit of a hike to the nearest station. The closest hotels/casinos to the HGVC, if memory serves, are Circus Circus, the Sahara, and a bit farther afield the Las Vegas Hilton and the Stratosphere. The advantage to this hotel's location, of course, is that you are a bit away from the absolute chaos that goes on, especially near the newer sites on the other end of the Strip on weekends, in particular. Impossible to drive and even hard to find space on the sidewalk at times. If you thrive on constant action, then this is probably not the place for you. If you want a comfortable, very relaxing location from which you can then journey either direction to dabble in the Vegas distractions, then this is ideal. I would definitely stay here again.

I had never been to Las Vegas before, so had read a lot about the strip ahead of time and was not surprised to see how far the hotel was from the main activities on the strip. It is about 2 miles from the center strip, that area that interested us the most with the big resorts like the Bellagio, TI, Caesars Palace, the Venetian, etc. The one bedroom suite we had, Tower 2, overlooked a desolate construction site and the Stratosphere and the Sahara were in view. it was still a very nice view at night from the 16th floor, despite the large nearly empty lot. The room was as others had described - be aware that not all one bedroom suites have jetted tubs or showers or DVD players, ours did not, but it did have all the other features mentioned and was very clean and well stocked with granite counter tops, plenty of towels, quality shampoo, Starbuck's coffee, etc. At first we could not get the phone to work (another guest had plugged it in wrong),, so a maintenance person came up right away and helped us out. For those who care about bedding, the bed was large and very comfortable, not too hard nor too soft.. Transportation was my biggest concern. I have trouble walking long distance on concrete, so I knew Vegas would be no picnic. There is really no FAST way to get to the center or south end of the strip except the monorail, ($5 a ride, one way) and it is quite a hike to get to it from the hotel. You have to cross a road that fortunately is not really very busy as there are no working pedestrian signals. You have to always go through a huge casino when you use the monorail, and up and down at least one set of escalators. The patter on the PA system of the monorail is hilarious - I guess they tried to make it funny and it is so corny, it is. .You end up making an even greater hike on the other end to get to the hotels. The Deuce -( the double decker city buses) - stops in front of the hotel about every 15 minutes and is new and clean , but can be very crowded to the point of having to wait for another one, and in traffic on Friday and Saturday it was amazingly slow - about 45 minutes from the top of the center strip to the hotel on one trip. It can be faster at times.... It is $2 EXACT CHANGE! Please don't ask the driver to change a $20!! And don't sit in the stairwell, or you will be shooed out. The shuttle to the Wynn- not well publicized at all, comes every half hour but ends quite early at night, about 8 PM, I would double check at the hotel - is free and is quite fast, about 10 minutes. The Wynn is at the very top of the center strip area. We did not try cabs, but we heard they are expensive and get caught in the same traffic. We contemplated walking from the Wynn to the hotel at night, but reconsidered when we saw blocks of very desolate areas we would have to walk by. All in all, we felt this non-smoky, non-gambling hotel was great, but if we went back to Vegas again, I think we would try to find an affordable place in the center of the strip. I did not compare prices, so maybe this is not entirely truthful!

Valet was typically quick and curious. There is an extra charge of $8 per day but with the Vegas August heat I was happy to pay this instead of schlepping to my car in self park. There isn't a casino on this property but there are MANY around and they are easy to get to via car, bus or taxi. Some people mention construction in their reviews - but right now there isn't any going on in the property. Word is that they are \"redesigning\" - possibly really just slowing down due to the recession. There was construction across the street - and in asking to face away from the HGVC construction (I didn't realize there wasn't any) we faced that construction. But couldn't hear it at all. I would suggest calling the property if you have concerns.

My husband and I are Diamond members and we received the proverbial eye roll when we asked about an upgrade. We were there during the week and the hotel seemed to be pretty quiet, so we just assumed it was the property's policy not to upgrade. I have to say, I too found the owner/renter distinction rather irksome. It felt like an us and them between Hilton and Hilton Grand Vacations Club. Hello guys- aren't you all supposed to be on the same team? If I get treated better at Hilton Hotels why would I ever buy into the Grand Vacations Club? It just seems counterintuitive to me. So it seems that this is a perfect place for owners, silver members, and those with no status with Hilton. The rates are very reasonable, the location was great, and, once again, the property is very nice. One more thing- the traveler who had the bad experience with the door not latching was right on. Luckily nothing was taken from our room, but you have to make an effort to make sure the door actually latches every time you leave the room.

When my flight was cancelled I called HGVC and apprised them of the situation, and told them I would be there hopefully by 10:30 am Wed. morning. When I arrived I was able to check in right away, and the manager even credited me for the previous night, which I didn't expect (but was much appreciated). This place is wonderful from the top down! I had booked directly on the Hilton website at $80 weeknight/$107 weekends for a guest room, and am a silver Hilton Honors member. Latanya was at the front desk and checked me in. I was upgraded to a 1-bedroom suite, which was wonderful! She put me in a suite away from construction (per my request). I faced Sahara Ave. and the Stratosphere and was on the 11th floor of Tower 2. I encountered no attitude from anyone because I was just a \"renter.\" The suite is just like the photos that have already been posted and was extremely quiet. We had no people partying in the hallways; everyone respected everyone else, even the families with kids. I had a rental car and parked in their new parking garage. Self-park starts on the fourth floor, but it really doesn't matter what floor you park on after that; just park as close as you can to the elevators, even if it's the 7th or 8th floor. It's a very short walk to the hotel (hint: once you get to the hotel, instead of walking up the steps, walk around to the left to the side entrance. Your card key will open the doors.) The elevators in both the hotel and the parking garage are extremely fast. There are 5 elevators for Tower 2 and 3 elevators in the parking garage. I was worried that it would be hard to get in and out of the hotel onto the strip, but it was extremely easy. If you're driving north on the strip you can make a left-hand turn onto the hotel property. Or you can drive I-15 or Industrial Rd. to Sahara, drive south on the strip and take a right into the property. I remember when traffic backed all the way to Sahara, but it certainly didn't do that even on Fri. & Sat. nights when I was there. If you want to get to Industrial Rd just take a right onto the Strip from the hotel, drive down to Circus Circus Blvd., hang a right and go down to the light...that's Industrial. Very easy to get to the parking lots behind the west-side Strip properties or to the Rio, Palms, or the Gold Coast. Very fast to get anywhere. I had a problem one night when the sound on my living room TV all of a sudden went out. I wasn't even close to the remote. The next morning it still didn't work, but the bedroom TV was fine. I called maintenance and he was there in no time. He said in Tower 2 the rooms are so close to each other that a remote in another unit can accidentally affect other TVs; I just had to turn the Bose sound system back on, so that was interesting. Everyone I encountered was always smiling and very friendly, from the front desk personnel to housekeeping to maintenance to the security personnel in the hotel and in the parking garage. No matter how late I was in my room (I had to work in the room a couple of days), when I left and returned a few hours later my room was always cleaned and ready for me. I give this property an A+++ and would love to stay here again!

We stayed here with another couple for 3 nights during Memorial Day weekend 2008. We requested that the rooms be adjoining or at the very least, be on the same floor across from each other. We got neither. Both rooms were on the 22nd floor of Tower 2, several doors apart. One room faced the north end of the Strip with a great view of the Stratosphere and the Sahara. The other room faced a construction site. Since we were rarely in our rooms and only stayed there at night, the lack of a view from one of the rooms wasn't important. We were allowed to check-in earlier than 4PM. The rooms were clean and smelled fresh. We didn't have daily housekeeping and didn't want to pay extra for it. Everything in the room worked well. We did have one phone call from the sales department inviting us to a welcome and update but it was very lowkey and low pressure. I said no thanks and they never bothered us again. We had a problem with our bathroom sink clogging up and the shower door had a gap that let water trickle out onto the floor. We asked for maintenance to fix it one morning and by 3PM, the repairs had been done. There's a nice Marketplace on the 1st floor that was always well-stocked - hot pizza, a nice selection of wine and beer, breakfast items including Starbucks coffee, daily soups and deli sandwiches. They also have several major newspapers. We also used the GrandVacationSpa on the 1st floor. Mr Flippitti and I got massages the first day there. They have a nice relaxation room and the massage therapists are experienced and personable. Our daughter and friend also had facials on Saturday and they claim it was a wonderful experience. You can also use their steam room, showers and sauna when you book a treatment. The prices are comparable to most hotel spas on the Strip. They add an 18% gratuity to the bill but you have the option to change that if you want. There's a CVS Pharmacy right next door that had everything that the Marketplace sells (except for fresh deli items) but at lower prices. It also had a bigger selection of frozen and microwaveable foods. This hotel doesn't have a casino so you don't have to walk through all the noise and smoke to get to the elevators. We never had to wait more than a couple minutes for the elevator. The business center has an ATM, movie rental machine, printer and fax rentals and a place for you to hook up your laptop. WIFI was free in our room but there's a charge to use the business center computers. In the 1st floor game room lounge, I was able to print out our boarding passes for free from one of their computers there. If that's all you need to use their computers for, go down there instead of the business center. The Deuce bus has stops right in front of the hotel. A day pass is $5 per person, one-way is $2 per person. You need exact change. There were a couple of times that we had to wait for the next bus when the first one was too crowded. We also took a couple of taxis and didn't have to wait too long at the taxi stand outside the hotel for them. Our group had two different experiences taking a taxi from the airport to the hotel. We paid $18 for our early Friday ride but our daughter and her friend ended up paying $27 for theirs when they arrived late Friday night. Apparently, in order to avoid Friday night traffic, their driver took them on a longer route to the hotel. We also hired a car service to drive us from the hotel to the airport early on Memorial Day for $63.

We stayed in tower one overlooking the pool and had a great night view of the major casino hotels on the strip to the south. They will be starting construction on the third tower sometime this month. We also stayed at the Hilton Grand Vacations Club at the Las Vegas Hilton (a few blocks away) last year.

The entire trip was great! We originally booked a week at the Rio All Suites. No sooner did we confirm the reservation, a Hilton rep called with an 'amazing' deal. Now, I was not very receptive to hearing committing to a time share presentation, etc., but for $99 ($107 with tax) for 5 days/4 nights in a one bedroom suite, I just couldn't pass it up. The accommodations were excellent. Rooms were clean, modern and tastefully appointed. I loved the garden tub! The pool was relaxing and yes, some areas do get shady as the sun moves, but no big deal...just move to a new lounger. We really liked Waves, the poolside bar/grille and although the selection is limited, the food/drinks/service were good. There's a nice little deli and store in the hotel and it serves its purpose for quick snacks. I had read some reviews that nothing is really within walking distance of this hotel and I would say that's not exactly accurate. The Sahara is one block north, the Riviera is one block south. There's a lot of construction going on nearby, but that's actually true for the entire mid-strip area. Besides, if you don't want to walk that much, pay $5 for a 24 hour pass on the Deuce, the bus line that runs up and down the strip. It is very convenient and they are constantly running. We did have to endure the 2.5 hour timeshare presentation but it was not that painful. We knew going into it that it was probably not something that we wished to make a long term investment in, but after a couple firm \"No's\" at the end of the sales presentation, we were on our way. Staff was very friendly. Maid service excellent. This is definitely a quiet establishment and there is not any entertainment within the hotel, no casino, etc. I actually found this to be a positive.

We were there on a Sunday & Monday nt which I think helped with the bargain price. However, the room was a basic Hilton hotel room with a wet bar which included a mini fridge, microwave, toaster and coffee maker. It was very nice but nothing of a 'Wow!' factor. **Try to book your time to listen to the spiel as early as possible so you don't lose the whole day for doing other things.** The sales pitch wasn't too pressured for us as we were pretty set from the beginning not to buy in - though aspects were tempting to think about for a future date. We gave as little information up front as we could when questioned which prevented them from using it later on to reinforce how great a deal the time share ownership would be for us. 1 helpful hint - you are screened ahead of time that you & your significant other at least have a combined income of $70, 000. HOWEVER, since you booked and attended the spiel, you can certainly have lost some of that income (i.e. \"job\") and your future is very unstable. ;-) Just be warned that it is a one-on-one pitch, you won't be with other possible buyers which of course makes it hard not to answer all the probing questions at the beginning. Also, the '2 hours' is an estimate as we found. It is that the actual presentation (all the facts & figures) will last between 90 & 120 minutes - IF however, you get off track with your salesperson and talk about other things it will last longer for sure!! Plus, they will always want to bring in their manager and the marketing person to talk to you too at the end to be sure the salesperson went over EVERYTHING with you. However, just stick to your guns if you aren't interested... hopefully you'll get out of there within 2 1/2 hrs as we did. Oh, there is a CVS just south of the Hotel so it is much cheaper to buy stuff there than at the in-house Market. Nothing made to order, but plenty of snack foods, drinks, etc...

The staff were really helpful - especially the car valets who became like friends during our stay and always went the extra mile - they even carried all my groceries to the room and helped unpack! When I needed 4 extra dining chairs for a dinner parity housekeeping delivered them quickly and without a problem. It has a great kitchen with everything you could need.

The oven didn't look as if it has been used - it certainly did when we left!! At this point I should say I love cooking and hate Vegas! I managed a couple of house off work to sit by the pool - some day sit was so hot that eh shade was very welcome. The music was really annoying but seems to be the norm in the USA. Yes the Market Place is expensive but it's convenient of you forget something. I had a hire car as I like to get out into the desert if I get any time off. They are really cheap - I paid about 25 pounds - 50 dollars a day which was cheaper than always taking a cab. There are Vons and Albertsons supermarkets close by with a great selection. I also found a fab Indian supermarket just up West Sahara where I got lots of spices (which probably didn't endear me to the other guests on my floor!). It was very reasonably priced at only $215 for a suite and I would definitely recommend it for a sane and safe place to stay in Sin City!

We were roped in by what many consider a high pressure sales pitch in Dec. while we were in Orlando. I'm not sorry that I bought in, but I am sorry that I didn't go to a reseller to buy, I could have gotten more points that way. This is our 1st trip to Las Vegas, so we didn't have any expectations of our experience. When we arrived from our flight, it was nighttime and we took the freeway by cab ($26 ride). It was easy to see that we were passing up all of the big casinos and coming in to the strip from the northern end where there was a lot less action going on. That upset me a lot on the night we arrived, because I thought \"on the Strip\" meant near the action! Very misleading if you ask me, and the Club reservationist I think purposely mislead me (that's a beef I'll have to take up with HGVC). If we had known, we would have stayed at the HGVC Flamingo b/c it was also available. I pressured my BF all day our 1st day to get a rental car. He kept saying we didn't need one, and he was right! We walked our 1st day to the Statosphere, a 10 min walk. It was a fun place, the tower was great, but we only did 1 ride, due to my BF's fear of heights! We met some nice people who gave us tickets to the hotel's \"high roller\" private party, and we had a nice meal and a lot of wine for free! Then we blew a lot of $$ at the slots, though... We went back to the hotel, sat in a very relaxing hot tub, and took a nap. Got up, got ready to go out by around 9pm. We had no problems at all catching and riding the bus down to central strip locations. $5 for a 24 hr pass. That late at night though, I wouldn't plan on taking a bus (or cab) further than the Belaggio. Traffic was completely clogged from that point on. We were going to Luxor, and we're pretty sure we would have been better off taking the monorail down to that end of the Strip. The monorail (looks like it starts at the Sahara which is very close, but the hotel says you can get on it at the Hilton property also nearby but a further walk) goes to the south end of the strip (MGM). It doesn't follow the strip, though, it goes behind the hotels to the east. We didn't try it though, maybe we will tonight. We walked a LONG way from the Bellagio to the Luxor, won't do that again. But we did love the Luxor, and its show, Fantasy!! When we were finished at the Luxor, about 4:30 AM (well 3:30 with time change), we walked to Tropicana, got breakfast at the 24 hr cafe there. We took a cab from Tropicana back to HGVC, and it was only $11.50. Not bad, but there was very little traffic at that time. So, to summarize this winded review (sorry), as long as you don't mind a bit of walking, you will NOT need a rental car to get around from this hotel, and the location is NOT a bust. It's actually been very quiet. My BF is still asleep at 12:30 PM while I'm writing this, and there weren't a bunch of crazy drunks hanging around when we got in this morning. We find that very relieving. We love drinking, but HATE stupid drunks!!

When I asked if I would have to sit through a timeshare presentation, they said \"no\". However, when I went through the second sales person to book the trip they said I needed to sit through a time share and I agreed. I also received $40 in cash at the Hilton Casino and $25 toward a dinner. I also booked to stay an extra few days. The hotel is located at the end of the strip very near the Stratosphere and across the street from the Sahara. The Sahara has monorail boarding and we used this frequently. The cost is $9 per day unlimited use. Due to the distance from the main part of the strip, we did a lot of walking. The check-in was easy and the woman was friendly. Our room was fantastic. We stayed in Tower 1 and it had a washer/dryer, kitchen area with dishes, etc., living room area, large bedroom, jacuzzi and large bathroom. There is no restaurant although there is a deli where you can also buy some groceries. There is also no bar or casino. We also rented a car and purchased \"Garmin\" GPS for $50 and it was well worth it. We went to Zion National Park in Utah for a day trip and it was beautiful. \"Garmin\" took us back and forth from the airport and elsewhere effortlessly. I'd highly recommend it. We also took a bus trip to the Grand Canyon. We asked the concierge what they had to offer and they gave us some recommendations but we ended up booking a trip with a place near MGM. We paid $99 and saved $50. People behind us spent $249 booking elsewhere. Expect a long bus ride to and from the canyon. We got on the bus at 6:10 a.m. and were back around 8:45 p.m. We did get to walk for 3 hours at the canyon. It included a box lunch and breakfast. We watched 3 movies. We also went to the same place and booked a 3 hour helicopter ride with a limo, champagne and food for $389 and saved $100. We looked elsewhere for the same kind of trip on the Internet and with the concierge and it was more expensive. This was well worth the money. I would take the helicopter trip over the bus ride any day. We went to the half price ticket sales center and bought Star Trek tickets for $25 which included both the Borg Invasion and Klingon encounter. The price on-line is $38 and they told me the price is $50 there. We also bought tickets to KA there for $96. The price on the ticket when we went to pick them up was $87 but the concierge at the Hilton had tickets from $115 to $139. I would recommend buying tickets from these type of places. There were a lot of people that tried to give us girlie show hand-outs on the strip and there were a few pan handlers near the Stratosphere but we didn't have a problem with pick pockets and never felt in danger when walking around after dark. We saved the time share presentation until near the end of the trip. We'd never been through one before and were not looking forward to it. We were surprised that the salesman was pleasant and friendly and assured us that it would not be a high pressure presentation and at first it wasn't but at the end when it came down to the money portion, it was high pressure. We spent 3 1/2 hours there. We refused the deal and we were sent a financial consultant who was there to answer questions and when we still refused we were finally sent to the sales manager who tried to give us a last chance deal where we could put $500 down and then get into a 15 month trial. The price range for the timeshare offers that we received were from $10,000 to $33,900. The thing is that we really liked the program and all it had to offer but we were not willing to sign a contract for that much money. We wanted time to research.

It is not close to anything; at least right now. There is a wave of high end development that is quickly spreading north along the Strip. Many adjacent lots are slated for expensive hotels and casinos, and THEN ad only then the HVGC will be right in the action. I strongly recommend those staying here get a car. We rented a mid-size from Dollar at a cheap $109, which is well worth the expense. As for the hotel itself, it presents itself a being strictly a timeshare destination. There are no restaurants or bars here. Forget about a casino or even a slot machine. You have to go elsewhere for these Vegas basics. The Marketplace is a quick spot to get a coffee in the morning or a bottle of water- nothing more. We found the valet staff very nice and friendly who hustled for their tips. The front desk made check-in and check out easy. We paid for and received a studio room. Despite other posts claiming free upgrades, one was not available when we asked check-in. I also called several times before arrival asking about an upgrade- Nothing. Our room was in the older tower 1. The room was small by typical Hilton or Marriott standards. We felt cramped here and would not recommend you stay unless a larger room is available prior to your arrival. The room was clean and housekeeping did a nice job keeping it neat during our stay. We understand HGVC is adding 2 more massive towers so construction may be an issue in the future for guests wanting to stay here. Both the pool and gym were nice. The gym has lots of new cardio and weight training equipment that guests can use at no cost. The pool was clean and well kept with a lifeguard on duty during opening hours. Although it was cool, we enjoyed a few hours in the sun on our final day. Overall, the HGVC is destined to be near real estate ground zero on the LV Strip in the next 1-3 years (trust me).

We were booked in a studio and upgraded at no charge to a 1bdrm suite. The suite was very nice and clean. Each time coming and going from our suite, we noticed a maintenance man always busy, which reflects a well managed operation. Housekeeping staff were keeping busy and always appeared hard at work and very friendly. Every time we left from or returned to the property, we were greeted by personnel with a smile. The accommodations were top notch. Now the downside. Location, location, location. Not good. To the north you have the run down Sahara, southeast you have the run down Riviera, directly south is Circus Circus trailer trash, and lots of riff-raff in between. This situation does the HGVC an enormous disservice to its potential. The new Trump International is under construction south of Circus Circus, across from another construction site and just northwest of Wynn. With the new construction, there is hope, but you still have the run down, older resorts and the class of people drawn to those resorts, which is not our preference. We frequent Vegas a couple times a year. We got to Vegas, as most people do, for the glitz and glam, poker rooms, Cirque productions and other comparable shows, nice dinners, and pampering. You will not find these things at HGVC. Aside from the accommodations, this resort lacks appeal to those who frequent Vegas for entertainment. For business travelers or families with children who do not plan to leave the resort, it's fine. You can cook your meals in your room and hang at the pool, which is great for some. I don't take my children to Vegas and I enjoy experiencing fine dining options. My idea of vacation with my husband away from our children is definitely not being confined to a resort with no amenities and no dining options other than pastries or a deli sandwich available at The Marketplace. I will say that prices in The Marketplace were very reasonable and comparable to grocery store prices. It's just not our thing to cook on vacation or do laundry in our room on vacation. We want immediate access to what we define as Vegas. Don't fear the time share presentation. Be upfront. If you are only going to get the perks, they are okay with that. Their time is literally wasted giving you the grand tour and presentation if you are going in with absolutely no intent to buy. Tell them you are there for the free stuff and they will deliver your incentives and send you on your way, so that they may get onto their next prospective buyer. Valet staff are incompetent. As we stand waiting for a taxi and notice others lingering with no attention from valet, a taxi arrives and everybody kind of looks around to see who gets the taxi. There was absolutely no organization or traffic direction whatsoever. Valet workers were absolutely clueless. I will say that we never waited for a taxi more than 5 minutes, although other reviews indicate otherwise, we did not have that problem at all. We were in charge though and that was bothersome. Valet needs to be re-trained and managed. I have little tolerance for ignorance. We will not return to HGVC in Las Vegas. We would definitely consider booking with HGVC in Orlando when taking the kids to Disney World, or in Hawaii on a family vacation, but this resort really just doesn't fit into the Vegas scene, especially in comparison to other options at newer, finer resorts with entertainment and dining on-site.

The gym in the basement is pretty good - 3 steppers, 5 treadmills, 5 bikes. Smith Machine, dumbbells, about 7 weight machines. It's not like one of the big resort fitness clubs, but, it is free. There is a small store/deli in the basement of the club. You are a captive audience here as there is nowhere else to shop. We wanted to buy breakfast food and some snacks... extremely expensive. The main complaint I have is the location. It is diagonally across the street from the Sahara which is a very remote casino. While the club is technically on the strip it is not near anything (this includes restaurants). Otherwise, there is really nothing else here - mostly dirt lots and there are some private condos next door. If you don't mind taking the bus, there is a bus stop for the shuttle right in front. However, we found that it was difficult to get on the bus (even at the north end of the strip) due to the bus being so crowded. With all the stops, it is about 15 minutes to get from this location down to Treasure Island. And, it is virtually impossible to get on the bus down at the real part of the strip in order to come back -- way too crowded. Didn't seem to matter what time we tried either (morning, night, late evening, all crowded). So we either were resolved to take a cab (about a 20 minute wait for the cab since this hotel is remote and there aren't a lot of cabs), or, walk the 25 minutes to get down to the popular areas (Venetian, etc.).

I booked through the Hilton website, and we would definitely stay here again. For those who might be afraid of heights, the taller tower is 39 stories (I couldn\u2019t find this info out before we went so I wanted to list it). Location/Outside Appearance: The hotel is located on the northern part of the strip, right next to the Sahara and Circus Circus casinos. There is easy access to the freeway and it is only a few miles south of the Fremont Street Experience. The outside of the hotel is spotless and well landscaped. Since it doesn\u2019t have a casino, the crowds and commotion are almost non existence here. Lobby/Check-In: The lobby and central hub of the two towers are very elegant and clean. The newness of the hotel is apparent. The workout room, game room, convenient store, and small caf\u00e9 are all located right next to each other in this hub. Check-in was super fast with no line (we checked in on a Thursday and had notice horrendous lines at the casinos we had visited earlier in the day). We were \u2018upgraded\u2019 to the penthouse level on the 37th floor. Our room was the one I reserved\u2026it was simply higher up. I guess you can call that an upgrade. Accommodations: We had a studio room with a king bed. Features included a flat screen TV, fridge, microwave, toaster, wet bar area, plates, and utensils. Also included were typical features like a coffee maker, iron/ironing board, hair dryer, etc. The room was spotless, I really can\u2019t complain about anything here. There was also free wireless internet access. The water pressure was excellent and we always had hot water. Also the water was obviously softened which was nice. Service: Housekeeping was great and the front desk staff was friendly. One thing to beware of when you stay here is that they will at some point try to get you to go through their timeshare presentation (If the name didn\u2019t tip you off, the HGVC is one of Hilton\u2019s timeshare properties; there is also one at the Flamingo hotel). For us, they called us at home a few weeks before we were supposed to arrive to schedule an appointment. When we got there we realized we wouldn\u2019t have time and just didn\u2019t want to deal with it. So when they called our room to remind us of our appointment I told them we couldn\u2019t make it and they didn\u2019t bug us anymore. Overall the HGVC on the strip was a nice place to stay. I\u2019m so glad we chose to stay someplace that didn\u2019t have a casino. The atmosphere at this hotel is like a breath of fresh air compared to the typical casino hotels (both figuratively and literally in that this hotel is non-smoking), the crowds are almost non-existent. We\u2019d definitely stay here again even with the timeshare salespeople, and I\u2019d recommend it to others.", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful accommodation, terrible location; noisy construction\u201d", "Author": "Gaviano", "ReviewID": "UR11219568", "Content": "Stayed at the HGV on the Strip on Nov 24-29.

Also, HGV is surrounded by all the scuzzy hotels like Circus Circus, and The Stratosphere, and you can't go for a stroll outside the hotel without meeting various dodgy-looking characters on the pavements (assorted hookers, drug-dealers, muggers etc...) Another drawback is the fact HGV doesn't have any kind of buffet or dining facilities. They've got a small deli on the premises, so you can get a coffee or a sandwich, but if you want a proper breakfast or dinner you have to head off up the Strip to one of the big hotels.

They had their own fridge, tv, bathroom etc. The swimming pool area is in the shade at certain times of the day but you soon figure out where to sit to get the sun, just move around.

There is no executive lounge, and WiFi was down for over 24 hours. There was a business center with 4 computers (to handle 60+ floors of guests in the two buildings), so you cannot expect to do any work there. There are no privileges for the HHonor benefits extended at the regular Hilton (about 3/4 mile away). I complained to the Guest Services/Welcome desk but was told that not giving complementary anything to HHonors people who are there more than 1 day was a new corporate decision. They wanted people to spend in the Marketplace store (breakfast of a biscuit sandwich, yogurt and coffee was about $10; a bottle of water was about $3). I was upgraded to a 1BR suite at check-in, which was nice. But having the doorbell ring at 8am by the cleaning staff (even on weekends) was not much fun.

The kitchen includes a dishwasher, washing machine, coffee maker, microwave and oven, which is everything you need to get by. We were on a high floor but the views are nothing special for Las Vegas. We could not see the Strip, just the mountains, which was beautiful at sunset though. Dining --------- The Hilton Grand Vacation Club is not really a hotel, but more of a luxury self-catering resort, or a home away from home. As such, there is only a small coffee shop and convenience store on the ground floor. However, they will still bring breakfast up for you. Overall --------- We enjoyed our stay and all the staff were very helpful. However, next time in Las Vegas we will stay at TI. We felt the Hilton was just a little too far away from the glitz and glamour of the Strip, which is what we went to Las Vegas for. We also missed having a proper restaurant and bar in the hotel.", "Date": "October 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cFirst Vacation in Vegas!\u201d", "Author": "meribor2", "ReviewID": "UR10054991", "Content": "This property is a combination timeshare/resort. We avoided the timeshare bit like an bad Elvis impersonator. The property itself is nice - a very art-deco sort of architecture and appointments, which we really liked. The valet area is a nightmare of inefficiency - I would counsel you to be prepared to just haul your bags in. The front desk staff were pleasant, but not overly friendly. The room was nice - we were in Tower One, and our 3rd floor room overlooked the front entrance, but I'm pleased to report that we didn't have any complaints with noise at all. We had a single king bed (as requested), and the room was nicely appointed. I did have an issue with housekeeping, as there was mildew on the shower curtain liner - definitely an unpleasant thing to encounter right after checking in! There was free wireless internet, but it was pretty sluggish during our stay. They have one computer downstairs in the \"Active Lounge\" where you can print boarding passes for free; otherwise, the computers require a credit card for access. The hotel is located on the north end of the strip, right off Sahara Blvd. If you're looking for quiet - this is the place to be, as the sidewalks aren't packed with hawkers, revelers, etc. The downside is that it definitely requires a car to access any of the places visitors commonly want to see while on the Strip. They don't have room service - which is okay, because based on the little cafe they have downstairs, it would be ridiculously expensive. We didn't go to the pool, as it was about 73 and very windy while we were there. It is possible that we didn't experience any construction noise while we were there because of the high winds keeping the workers off the high-rise portions, but I don't know that for a fact. All in all, I think we would be willing to stay here again on a future trip. The prices were reasonable (about $170 a night), I was able to actually sleep, and the refrigerator/freezer/microwave was handy for reheating leftovers from the night before.

The only other complaint I have was the staff -- they weren't very competent and didn't seem trained in how to fix their errors.

We both really liked the hotel, and would definitely stay here again. The hotel is clean and very quiet. There is no casino in this hotel, and therefore, you do not have to deal with the noise, etc. You almost forget you are in Vegas. The rooms are a bit larger than average. They come with a mini fridge, microwave, toaster and coffee maker. The room is even stocked with plates, silverware and glasses. We were able to go to a nearby grocery store and stock up on food for our time there. The bed is very comfortable, aside from the pillows. The pillows are the ones that flatten completely as soon as you lie down on them. However, the bed itself is comfortable, and the blankets are very plush. The room temperature only goes down to 65 degrees, and a few nights we had trouble sleeping because it was so warm. I think maybe the thick covers were a bit too much (despite how comfortable they were)! The hotel gym is very nice if you want to do cardio. There were about 8 to 10 treadmills, 3 elipticals, and 5 bikes. Even when the gym was crowded, you could find a piece of equipment to use. The gym had 5 or 6 plasma screens around the room which made the workout go a bit faster. The weight equipment looked great, but after one day of lifting, I decided to do only cardio while I was there. The machines were hard to adjust to different body sizes, and for instance, the cable cross machine had weights that were almost impossible to move - something wrong with the pulley. However, they do have dumbbells and weighted bars. The staff was great. We had questions every night, and always loved the recommendations. I had some things to fax for work, and the fax machine in the business center was not working. Without hesitation, a staff member faxed my material for me behind the front desk - no charge. The only possible downside is that this hotel is at the complete opposite end of the strip from all of the \"action.\" I thought this was a good thing though, but for those of you who want to be able to walk out each night and visit different hotels, etc. - you'll have to take a cab or bus. The big mall near the convention center was exactly one mile from this hotel. There really isn't much going on around this hotel, so be prepared for that. Overall, excellent experience.

At least not full price. My mother owns a timeshare and let us use a week of her time in exchange for paying the service charge of $200. And $200 for a week at this resort was an obscene bargain. Secondly, don't pay any attention to people who complain about things that should have been patently obvious to anyone who did five minutes of research before they came. Yes, it's a little far from the action. No, it doesn't have a casino or sit-down restaurant. So what? Las Vegas has hundreds of restaurants and casinos just a short drive away. If those things were all that important to you, why did you pick this hotel in the first place? Speaking of driving, it's also true you'll need a car to get anywhere. But the fact is, Vegas is so spread out you'd need a car to fully appreciate it no matter where you stayed. The room itself was wonderful. It was clean when we arrived and clean again after housekeeping arrived in mid-week. I would have preferred it be cleaned every day but, again, I knew the drill when I made my reservations. I especially loved the jet tub in our room and spent hours reclining in it -- sometimes alone and sometimes not. I found the staff to be more than responsive to my every question or concern. Then again, being the sort who'd rather roll his luggage a few feet to the elevator or walk out the back door to the parking lot for his own car rather than always slipping someone $5 to do it for me, I didn't ask for much. I did ask the concierge for information several times, though, and found them almost disturbingly efficient. The pool was clean and attractive. It may have been crowded in the afternoons, but we always went in the evening, just before going to bed, and pretty much had the whole place to ourselves -- even over Labor Day weekend. In sum, if you're looking for an all-inclusive resort that has everything you could ever want under one roof -- including gambling, five-star restaurants and glitzy shows -- this isn't the place for you.

We were very impressed with the HGVC on the Strip because it was very clean, modern, had no casino, had a pool, and a place to get breakfast in the morning. I wasn't interested in having a casino in the hotel because we don't gamble but mainly because the hotels that do have casinos force you to walk through them, which stinks up your clothes because smoking is allowed in most. It was a pretty good deal at an average of $200/night, especially for a suite. Our one bedroom suite was really nicely sized, with an open kitchen. I appreciated the washer/dryer and dishwasher in the kitchen. The bedroom had a jacuzzi tub (all suites in Tower 1 do, said our bellman) which I thought was a little weird but nice to have (though I didn't take advantage of it). The 24 hour market is very overpriced on grocery items- a box of cereal was close to $7, a tube of hand cream was almost $4. However, the coffee bar was decently priced- $2.50 for a large Starbucks coffee. There was limited room service but no restaurant. Even a diner would have been appreciated. As I mentioned, I was attending a tradeshow at the Convention Center which is about a mile away so I took a cab each morning- with tip, it worked out to about $9 each way. The monorail is NOT convenient to the HGVC. We thought it was weird we couldn't call the valet desk for our car and we didn't care for having to wait in the 100 degree weather for our car. Customer service was very good. The first room they brought us to smelled of smoke, even though it was supposed to be non-smoking (not uncommon because not even smokers seem to like a smoking room!). We asked them to move us to a non-smelly room and they did immediately. We had packages waiting for us at the belldesk but there was some confusion about what they looked like. They found them within 20 minutes and brought them up to our room. We had a few problems operating our tv and each time I called for help, the engineer showed up immediately. Same with Housekeeping when I called to ask them to clean up a broken glass. Because of its very north Strip location and distance from the action, we could have been staying off the strip because we always had to use our car and the monorail wasn't really an option. I wish there were things to do within walking distance and in the future, I might consider staying off the strip if the hotel was as nice and less expensive. For a family friendly place, I would have expected more stuff for kids.

We stayed here as part of a time share preview with the Hilton. I struggled with what rating to give this hotel/resort and went back and forth between a 3 and 4 rating. Please read the details to see if the negative items matter as much to you. Keep in mind, this is a timeshare property and they are still building on the grounds (though this did not interfere with our stay). LOCATION: The Hilton Grand Vacation Club is located \u201con the strip\u201d which basically means it is on Las Vegas Blvd. It is at the north end of the strip. As far as a prime strip location, this is not located in what is considered the best spot (depending on what you are looking for). You will not be able to walk to anything, unless you want a long walk. Strip hotels do tend to be set back from the street; however you are generally able to walk around to other hotels or attractions. Some hotels even have access to the monorail, but the Hilton is not connected to this. At the Hilton, you will need a rental car to go anywhere. There is a double decker bus that some reviewers have talked about riding. Every time we saw the bus is was packed wall to wall with people. Thankfully we drove in from Los Angeles and had our own car so we did not have to experience this first hand. AMMENITIES: This is a new resort, so everything is new. They had a nice looking large pool area. There was a bar that sells overpriced grill food, though this appears to be an afterthought since there were no signs and we had to go to the bar and ask for a menu. If I was going to spend the day lounging at the pool I probably would have eaten here without grumbling about the price. We decided to go elsewhere. There is a workout room that looks state of the art. There is also a convenience store that sells a variety of items, however they appeared a bit overpriced (more than I would expect). They were open late which was nice considering there is nowhere to eat at the hotel after the pool bar closes in the afternoon. Their lobby is not really a lobby. It is more of a small pathway around an area that opens to a lower floor. The check in desk is squeezed in on one side and the concierge desk on the other. There is no casino or slot machines on the grounds. This may be an issue for some people. I did enjoy not having to trudge through a casino to get to my room. There is no room service here, which is a negative for me. It does appear that all rooms have at least a kitchenette (we had a full kitchen) so you will have the capability to make your own meal if you did not want to go out. SERVICE/STAFF: My frustrations began upon arrival. We pulled up to a major traffic jam at the entrance. After sitting in the car for 20 minutes I got out in search of a valet, manager or anyone with the hotel. I could see cars just sitting there without people in them. Other people around me appeared equally frustrated. I finally tracked down a bell person. He told me it would be 10 minutes or so before someone could help me with my bags or car. While I thought this was a one-time occurrence, it was not. It seemed day or night the valet was slow or backed up. Even late at night when traffic was light, we pulled in to find no one staffing the valet desk and hotel guests looking around with a confused look trying to find someone. Making matters worse, we could not call the valet to bring our car up. This had to be done in person meaning a wait each time. They plan to add two more towers, doubling the size of this resort. They have to address this problem or it will get even worse. Parking is limited and the one time we tried to park on our own we found the lot was completely full. They are in the process of building a new parking structure. We had limited interaction with anyone else at the hotel. The front desk staff seemed polite but not too overfriendly. We went to use the concierge desk once and found there was a significant wait and decided to skip seeking their advice. The timeshare salespeople were of course over the top nice, but they are salespeople so of course they would be. One thing that was annoying, they called the room at 9:30am to \u201cremind\u201d us that we had a timeshare presentation scheduled for 1:30pm that day. This woke all of us up. Vegas is a place you stay up late and sleep late so I am surprised they called this early. You may want to have the hotel desk put your phone on do not disturb if you are staying here. ROOM: We had a one bedroom suite with a kitchen. We were put in a handicapped room (not our request) which was odd. While I can deal with wider doorways and grab bars there were other things that were annoying. The countertops were all lower, at 6\u20192\u201d it is too short for me. The doors had giant extension handles on them that stuck out about 10\u201d from the door on each side (they hurt if/when you bump into them). These handles also disable locking the bathroom doors. Instead of a standard doorbell, the room had an ear piercing alarm that thoroughly scared my kids when I tried it. The room had not been cleaned too well. There were smudge marks all over the fridge and the stove needed a good cleaning as well. Besides this, the appliances all looked new but I would hate to see what they look like in another year. The d\u00e9cor was odd. I think whoever decorated this was colorblind. There were browns, reds, blues and greens. Nothing really matched though everything looked new and did not look cheap. The kitchen was great in that it had everything we needed to cook a full meal. Everything was full size. The pullout sofa was very poor quality; thankfully my kids (5 and 7) are not too heavy that it made a difference to them. For an adult, it may be a problem. The bathroom lacked any sort of counter space. For a room that was intended for 4 people, this is a problem. The master bedroom was fine; the bed was more than comfortable with down-like pillows. I also found that the price of in-room phone calls was seriously overpriced. Local calls cost $1 a minute and state to state were even higher. This is higher than most hotels; then again other items at the hotel seemed to be priced higher than average. If I was one of the \u201cowners\u201d of a timeshare here, I would have serious problems with the prices they are charging. There is wired and wireless internet access available. I used the wireless. The signal was strong and the speeds were always good. At over 2mbps, they were higher than I generally find at hotels. NOISE: This is my biggest complaint and deserves its own heading. We were on the front side of the resort in tower 2 facing northbound with a view of the strip. We were on the 21st floor. From our room we could hear the construction noise from the parking structure they are building. There are also plans to build two more towers on this resort and another company has plans for a large resort on all sides of the Hilton. So, construction noise may be an issue for years to come. We were awakened one morning by a wonderful symphony of our neighbors having \u201crelations.\u201d My wife and I cheered them on and then applauded at the fantastic finish. Really, the nightstands in our room were shaking. It is interesting because I saw other reviewers mention this happening to them here. Funny, I travel a lot and only experienced this is at the cheaper motels. Noise from the hallway was an issue. We could hear people coming and going even in the master bedroom with our door closed. Again, having stayed in many hotels, this is not something I am used to. Let me just say, I expect noise, however the noise level here was surprising. I seriously question how much thought was put in to soundproofing. OVERALL: For a first time visitor to Las Vegas, I would not recommend staying here. You should stay at a hotel in the middle of the strip, more close to the action. If you have been to Vegas, and know what it is all about, this may be a good option if you wanted something more out of the way. Personally, I would rather stay at the Embassy Suites off the strip than stay here again. It is cheaper, just as spacious and aside from the kitchen it has everything the Hilton had and more. TIMESHARE: I have had people ask about the timeshare aspect of this hotel. If you are staying here as part of a timeshare preview, this will pertain to you. Being that this is the Hilton, you will not find the salespeople obnoxious by any means. We had to take the tour as part of this package and we held up our end of the bargain, spending about 2 hours hearing their sales presentation. These are professional salespeople, they know how to read people and are prepared to overcome any obstacle you have to buying a timeshare. After seeing we may be a little interested, our salesman brought over his boss \u201cjust for a second\u201d because he had the pricing. His boss ended up taking over the presentation while the salesman kept our kids entertained at another table. We decided that it was not a great value so the presentation ended, but not before the Sales Director came over to take a survey about how the salesman was (i.e. was he professional, etc.). All this ended up being was another chance for them to loop us in, we were offered a chance to buy a preview of their Orlando or Hawaii resort without committing to buying the actual timeshare. I checked out this offer, but it had a lot of fine print and did not seem like a good value at all. So we declined and left. Was the hassle of sitting through this worth the deal I got to stay at the hotel? For us it was well worth it, though we had to drive to the original Hilton resort off the strip to get our $40 in chips and use the $25 dining certificate (which we used at Benihana\u2019s).

I always love sharing my thoughts on Trip Advisor but I also realize that this is kind of more of a hotel sight than a \"resort\" or \"timeshare\" review sight ... but in travel these days .. they cross over .. so I'm sharing this review as a review of a hotel but recognize that I stayed there in a \"resort/timeshare context,\" This is a great place to stay. The room was beautiful. It was beautifully appointed ... sort of odd really, nothing matched and yet everything went together. The bed was so comfortable. It was just a great place for a weekend. I don't really know how this place is marketed as far as a hotel ... it really is a timeshare resort. Honestly, I don't think I would buy there .. but this site is more directed toward hotel stays so that's what i'm going to review it as. As far as a place to stay for a couple days it is absolutely wonderful. The room is beautiful, comfortable and there is almost everything you need for a few days. There is a great Marketplace which pretty much has everything you need - coffee, food, dinner, etc. albeit at a high price but if you are there for a couple days .. who cares and if you stay for a week you will probably go to the market. The pool ... Hmmmm. Nice, but it depends on what you are looking for. If you are a sun chaser like me you will have to either just have some patience or move your lounger around. There are too many palm trees so if you want sun all day you will have to keep moving. If you don't care about that then the pool is great. When I was there a child had an unfortunate incident in the pool with diarreha so the whole thing had to be shut down ... not too nice. Again, this is not really a hotel as much as a time share but I know it is available as a hotel and I would not detract from it in that regard. The rooms are beautiful and if you want a place that has almost everything it is great. The Marketplace offers everything from fruit to pizza to Starbucks to beer and you can really stay there for days without need. Some people discern because there is no casino -- but I believe this issue is not well placed. Vegas is changing. The Strip has gone from wild to family to -- now \"resort.\" This resort does not have a casino and it's not in the center of the Strip, but it is very close to Sahara - which has a Monorail connection and that can get you to wherever you need to go including gambling and restaraunts. It will cost you but this resort can provide whatever you need. Honestly, my only complaint is that there is not a lounge. Granted there is beer and wine etc. in the Marketplace and you can prepare whatever you want in your room ... but if you come in late at night and just would like to have a drink without having to buy stuff for your room ,,, there is really no option. I think they should open a little piano bar lounge where late nighter's could get a night cap.", "Date": "August 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, Virginia", "Title": "\u201ca very nice property - location is a bit remote\u201d", "Author": "jmhmomma", "ReviewID": "UR8517556", "Content": "We own a timeshare in this property and always enjoy staying there.

The facility is fairly new and has been well kept. The bell service was terrific. They were always making sure we were taken care of, and even provided bottled water if we had to wait for a cab or shuttle. I was actually glad this Hilton did not have a casino. The lobby was nice and neat and without cigarette smoke! They do not yet have a restaurant, but we had a full kitchen in our unit and since Hilton offers free wireless internet, we were able to easily order groceries from Albertson's online and they delivered to our door. The Hilton has a small store that is open 24 hours. It is a nice convenience, however, the prices are quite high. The pool atmosphere was also enjoyable. There was plenty of seating and some of the chairs were arranged in areas away from the pool, which was much more relaxing than being right next to the pool. The pool bar offered quality food and drink and friendly service. I liked that the housekeeping service was optional. We could have our room cleaned for a fee or we could just request towels and shampoo. Housekeeping checked with us once during the week to make sure we had what we needed. The location of this Hilton is ideal, as it is about halfway between the old section (Fremont St), and the newer section, yet it is on the new strip. The shuttle from the airport was cheap - $5.95 pp, and we took the double decker bus up and down the strip for $5 per day. The hotel concierge was helpful in connecting us with a rental car through Budget. It was about $45 for the day and we drove to Hoover Dam. The only issue we had involved a garbage can that did not get emptied promptly on our floor outside of the elevators. We called two days in a row because the smell of rotten garbage was so bad.

The kitchen and everything was clean, very happy. You must ask for the pool view in tower one. Tower 2 only has 2 views the strip, how many times can you look at neon lights over 5 days? The second view was of ongoing construction of new parking and hotels. The pool was excellent and friendly service. It's a real family atmosphere. Nice slow and easy. No wild girls like the other fast pace gambling hotels. You must rent a car period. If not, It will be like you are in the walkathon. It may be 2 or 3 blocks to get some other foods or see hotels , but these are long hot July Vegas blocks. The Double Duce bus was always packed and it looked very hot. Not a pleasant sight in July. The freedom of jumping in your rental was great. I was able to run up to any other hotel anytime I wanted to see the other sights and restaurants. The massages like everyhing were expensive, I picked the free work out room and pool. No real restaurant on site. They have a place called the market \" very clean and nice\". Since you have a refirerator and micorwave,stove etc.. You can buy milk,cereal, sandwiches and other fun foods. Think of a high class 7-11 store with the food precooked under a light. If you really need hot cooked food go outside to the pool hostess. They have a short order cook for fast items such as hot dogs,hamburgers. Try the eggs and bacon in the a.m. with the fruit. Again a very limited menu and only if you are at the pool area. My special tip for anyone, you must get a rental car. We drove down to the Hoover Dam only 50 minutes. The hotel desk will give you the directions. We drove out to Red Rock park to see the wonderful mountain view you will see from you hotel room in tower one \"\" pool side '''. 45 minutes. After spending a lot of money on the strip for subway and other common names. It was much cheaper off the strip to feed your family.

Rooms at the big hotels were over $400 per night since it was the weekend and last minute. We decided to go with the King Studio for $149 at the Hilton Grand. Since reviews were great, decided to give it a try. Well, I guess I'm writing this from the point of view of the King Studio. The other reviews seem to be on the suites or condos. Our room had typical Hilton amenities but nothing above and beyond for Vegas. When we got to the hotel, it was about 1 am and we had rented a car from Hertz (hint... to avoid long lines, sign up for express membership). Pulling up, the valet saw us but never came to service us. I went inside to check in and 10 minutes later, my husband finally came in after getting someone to park the car. The gentleman at the front desk was friendly enough. We had called ahead to have a crib set up in our room and when we checked in, he confirmed the crib was in the room. We got our King Studio room and when we opened the door, no crib and no washcloths. Our room view was supposed to be of the strip but all I saw was construction across the street (room 11009). The TV was an older 27\" but the mini-kitchenette was a nice addition. The floors and counters were nice and modern in the bathroom, typical Hilton touch. But everything else was basic for Vegas. For the room, we were just satisfied. Nothing stood out or had a \"wow\" factor. The disappointing part of the Hilton Grand was the valet service. After our initial experience upon arrival, we should've knew to just self park. The next day when we got up, we tried to call ahead to have our car ready. It was extremely hot and it would have been nice to have the car on with the AC going. Nobody ever answered the phone. We get downstairs and it takes over 20 minutes to get our car. That is the longest I've ever had to wait and there wasn't a huge crowd to blame it on. While we were waiting we talked to one of the guys and found out they're not supposed to accept call aheads but they sometimes do. I guess if they answer the phone... Anyway, the next day was even worse. We happened to get our car around check-out time. Wow. Talk about a back-up. It took almost an HOUR to get our car!! People were standing outside all over the place. I even heard one of the bellboys complain about it taking over an hour to get someone's car whose bags he'd been holding. They really need to learn how to prepare for busy times like that. It would've been much quicker and simpler to self-park. At MGM, parking gets hectic due to the large crowds but they have an organized system and staff that works it all out. The Hilton was highly disappointing.

Reception was very friendly and efficient and got me into my room minutes after I had arrived after a long transatlantic flight, even though the official check-in time was two hours later. I had booked a one-bedroom suite and was very pleasantly surprised, especially by the kitchen which was better equipped than mine at home! It included a stove, oven, coffee-maker with complimentary Starbucks coffee, fridge, micro-wave, dishwasher, washing-machine and dryer and all the plates, cutlery and utensils you could ever need. Although we never cooked, it was very pleasant to be able to use the plates and glasses for snacks, brew a cup of coffee in the morning and have a huge refrigerator to store our drinks. The rest of the apartment was equally well equipped, with a huge LCD TV in the living room, DVD player, iron and board, in-room-safe, second TV in the bed-room, free and fast WLAN, large king-sized bed and a huge jacuzzi tub. The interior wasn't really of cutting edge design or extremely luxurious but pleasant enough. Also very practical is that the hotel maintains a 24h mini-market on the first floor where you can purchase cold drinks, snacks, ice-cream, Starbucks coffee, freshly made sandwiches and pizza etc. The Hilton is located at the very beginning of the strip and it's quite a walk to the fancier casinos but for my needs, the location was perfect. There's a 7-Eleven and Wal Mart in walking distance and also a Denny's restaurant which may not be a big deal for Americans but is an absolute treat for us Europeans. For a quick bout of gambling, there are three casinos very close by and frankly, to me they all look more or less the same from the inside and you'll lose your money just as quickly in any of them. But of course, the spectacular casinos located in the middle and the end of the strip must be visited as well, a cab ride costs about $10 + tip from the Hilton or one can take a bus which stops close to the hotel entrance. We usually walked in the evenings when it was a bit cooler and took the cab during the day. I've been to Las Vegas quite a few times and until now always stayed in mid-priced casino hotels like the Monaco or Aladin. For a similar price, the rooms at the Hilton are vastly more pleasant than a typical medium-range casino hotel.

The strip is shut down to traffic and there's partying on the street all night long. But it was absolutely fabulous staying at the Hilton Grand because, at the end of the day, you come back to a nice quiet place to lay your head down. It's not your typical Vegas-style over-the-top hotel...There's no \"theme\" and, more importantly, there's no enormous, noisy, smokey casino to walk through to get to your room. We stayed at the MGM Grand before and it was so annoying to have to snake through the casino for 20 minutes before getting to your room. Don't get me wrong...we like to party, have fun and do a little gambling like everyone else, but we like wandering around to different places to check out the scene, so the fact that the hotel we were staying in didn't have a casino didn't bother us at all, in fact, we viewed it as a plus. It was easy to get in and out and parking was never an issue. Oh and yes, this hotel is at the north end of the strip (between Stratosphere and Circus Circus) and it'll take you forever to walk anywhere, but I think the same is true anywhere you stay! All the hotels are so enormous that, even if they're \"side-by-side\", it'll still take you 1/2 hour to walk from one to another. Let's face it, Vegas is not a walking kind of town. Everyone rents a car, that's why they're building the largest airport car rental terminal in the world there. So don't worry about how far away you are from the center of the strip, just rent a car, enjoy, and cruise the strip! As for the hotel rooms themselves... awesome! We had our 1 year old baby with us and it was great having a separate bedroom to ourselves where we could soak in the hot tub, watch tv etc. while she slept in the other room. The kitchen was handy to have and all the amenities were top notch. It really felt like we were staying in a nice condo rather than a hotel.

The rooms, pool and lobby all look just like the website photos and the photos posted here. So no surprises. The pluses for me: Quiet hotel, I wanted to sleep, rest, and visit with family. So no casino noise, and no drunken neighbors next door. I wasn't even aware that the rooms on either side were occupied. Traffic at that end of the strip was lite, so easy in and out. Large comfortable suite, at a lower price than most regular hotels. The concierge and the bell desk were very helpful with dinner reservations, show tickets, and airport transportation. Even at 3 am when I had to leave for my return flight. I am a female traveling alone, and was looking for somewhere safe and quiet. The minuses: The bathroom didn't have an exhaust fan, so steams up quickly. Also the shower was very hot, and if you turn the water down to cool off, then no pressure. The small grocery/cafe shop has very limited selections, the prepared food items were not great, and I thought all the items from chips to drinks and sandwiches were pricey. $7.95 for a ham and cheese sandwich from the prepared counter. But, I had stopped at the grocery store on my way to check in, so I was well supplied. All in all I had a great stay.

I stayed here overnight in 2005 and loved it...so I booked for the second time during a recent visit and had a terrible visit. Okay...the nitty gritty. I guess the first thing I noticed both times is that staying here doesn't feel like you are in Las Vegas. This is a good and bad and really depends on what you want. It's great because you don't have the casino (since the lobby doesn't have the slot machines or any games) feel but then, it feels like any other average city. And if you're going to Vegas, you want to feel like you're there! Also, even though it is on the strip, it's at the far end of the strip so though you can walk to the actual center of town, it's a bit of a trek to. Both times, this was a bit of a hassle.... If you are staying at the HGVC, it's important to stay in the suite. This means, you spend a little but you have more room to relax in. Also, the suite has a jacuzzi, kitchen & sitting area (or a spare room for more guests) whereas the regular room is just a sleeping area and is connected to the other side of the suite with a single door. In our most recent visit, my fiance booked the room without realizing that there were two types of room. They were completely booked so we stayed in the single room. What we noticed about the single room was that it was drastically louder. We heard the people to our left coming home from partying and continuing the party and to our right (if you can believe it!), we heard the couple having sex! Let's just say, when we wanted to sleep, we couldn't. Also, as a \"special deal\", we had to go to a Hilton timeshare presentation. Don't get roped into this....it isn't THAT much of a saving and we wasted over 3 hours listening to a very, very persistant salesman.

But we rented a car for the week, and had NO problems nor regrets. In fact we were happy that we didn't have to walk everywhere in the heat & the crowds, nor wait for cabs or buses or monorail. We watched the masses being herded around from our car window as we zipped around town. Every resort in Vegas has free parking. Just avoid driving on Las Vegas Blvd during busy hours. Stick to Paradise Rd. or Industrial Rd. It takes 5-10 minutes to get to any resort property on the Strip (15 min to the airport).

From our room, we could see the MGM, the Wynn, Palms, Rio, and others. At the moment the rooms facing the strip have a limited view of Las Vegas Blvd because of a high-rise condo tower next door. The 2 planned towers to be built will be higher than the existing towers. The higher floors of these new towers might have a better view.

Appliances at your disposal (including a disposal) make you feel right at home. Hot water is instantly VERY HOT! Water pressure is great. Had only 1 problem where the Bose system would turn itself on at random times. Engineering service arrived within 7 minutes. They knew of this issue particular to Bose Lifestyle 5.1 systems. Other Bose units can interfere if their radio signals overlap. They reprogrammed the remote and base system to use a different radio frequency, and the problem was resolved. The pool area seemed smaller than other HGVC properties we've stayed at. I'm only guessing if Hilton will build a second pool when the 2 new towers are built. Fitness center was very usable, and had good hours 6am-10pm. On-site convenience store was comfortably stocked, and had good prepared deli foods. But we went to Costco even before arriving at the hotel, since suites at all HGVC properties have full kitchens & laundry. Line for Starbucks coffee at the deli can get long in the mornings. Don't know why because they give you the same Starbucks packets in the room for the coffee maker! The ladies didn't reserve any time at the day Spa, but it had a nice decor, and listed all services you'd expect. They were offering a free chair massage in the lobby on one day, to promote the Spa. Lunch by the pool was very good, and reasonably priced. Standard fare, apps, sandwiches, burgers, salads, mixed drinks, etc. I would not consider the Vegas Strip is a high crime area at all. We didn't feel threatened by any means at any of the resorts we visited. With that said, Security is very noticeable and pleasant at this hotel; it was very comforting. The concierge service was not exactly on par with Concierge services in the swanky NY Hotels. But they are quite capable of helping you book a tour or show. They did provide us with some excellent restaurant tips. (Firefly is a great tappas style restaurant) They had a special Japanese-speaking desk for Japanese travelers. We didn't use the owner's lounge - pool tables and such. Looked very nice. Seemed to us it was mostly used by kids. Free 802.11b WIFI in this hotel. But watch out for internet and printing fees in the business center. READ the fees & instructions carefully! They are still selling timeshares at this hotel. They have 2 offices onsite, one for existing owners, and one for potential buyers. Nobody ever approached, nor asked our guests (non-owners) about attending a timeshare presentation. But the tv does change itself to the 'Hilton Channel' every time you turn it on. In my opinion, this is the nicest Hilton property in Vegas.", "Date": "April 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, TN", "Title": "\u201cVery nice!\u201d", "Author": "Kitikata", "ReviewID": "UR7279152", "Content": "We stayed under a 2 night special deal in exchange for one of our party to sit through the time-share presentation. I took the Executive Shuttle ($6 one way) and it was important to tell the driver we were staying at the Hilton Grand Vacation Club on Las Vegas Blvd next to Circus Circus. There are at least 2 other Hilton Grand Vacation Clubs (Hilton and Flamingo) and it is important to be dropped off at the right place. The others in my group got dropped off at the Hilton Grand Vacation Club Hotel which is on Paradise Ave. They ended up walking the mile to the correct location, after the front desk at the other Hilton figured out they were at the wrong property. We stayed in Tower 2 in a one bedroom. There was a full kitchen with Cuisineart cookware, coffee maker with Starbucks coffee, and a full fridge. There is a full dining table. There was a laundry machine and one person in my group did laundry. The big TV was hard to figure out the remote control. The bathroom had a nice large shower. The bed was really comfortable. This place was as big as my last apartment in Philadelphia. The staff provided good service. The deli/convenience store downstairs had some basic pantry items, a dessert and sandwich counter, a salad and fruit case, a pizza counter, and a Starbucks. I got milk and cereal for the mornings, and a bunch of microwave popcorn for snacks. There are 2 small pools, of which one was closed while I was there. There is a nice workout room. There is a business center with a computer and fax machine. There is free wireless internet in the room. There is also a spa on-site with all the typical spa treatments you get at any full service spa. All of these amenities were like being at home, and the room and building was quite comfortable for us. There were kids in the building, but the sound proofing was so good, I never heard them. This property is not convenient to transportation except taxi. The trolley people were talking about in other posts was not running when I was there. I waited for the bus, at a bus stop down the driveway, for quite a while, and it never came. I walked over to the Sahara by crossing a fairly busy main road, and took the monorail to the Strip for $5 per ride, or $15 all day (runs 19 hrs per day). The taxis seem to cost about $10.50 to get down to the mid-strip, and to Freemont St downtown. Doing the math, if you have 2 - 3 people to transport, it is just as cheap to take a taxi than the monorail, and you can be dropped off at the door you want to go to. When I wanted fun and glitz, I went down to the big casinos, and when it was time to sleep, I went back to the hotel. I personally liked the feeling of a retreat from the bing-bing and the bling-bling of the gaming floors. It was a very relaxing and quiet stay.", "Date": "April 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, MD", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "TAmember10", "ReviewID": "UR7268077", "Content": "We stayed for a week March 20-27, 2007.

The rates were VERY reasonable. $129 for Friday & Saturday, then &99 Sunday & Monday. Considering that Bally's was charging $270 - that was a deal. The property is gorgeous. It is a time share - I've stayed at other time shares and been hassled to death. Buying a timeshare was never mentioned at this property at all. The front desk staff was helpful & friendly. My room was simply beautiful. And the view of the strip was breathtaking. The property is pretty new. They say they are building a parking garage and there is construction accross the street - which might be it - but I didn't hear any construction. The bus & trolley stop about every 9 minutes right outside so getting up & down the strip is pretty effortless. This is actually a place that I might consider buying. And I travel a lot for buisness & pleasure - this is one of the nicest properties I've ever stayed at. Beware of the cab drivers. This place is close to the airport - the drivers work on commisson. I was talking to the cabdriver that took me to the airport (it was his first day) he only charged $15. My friend who left of Friday was charged $35. They are notorious for ripping off tourists. You can take a shuttle from the airport for around $5. And buy a roundtrip ticket for $10. You buy them when you arrive at the airport. It's easy. The Duece, is a bus that runs up & down the strip (and to freemont st.) 24 hours a day. You can get a 24hr. pass for $5. Walking the strip is impossible. On the map it looks close together - but it's not at all. The bus is the best way. It comes every 9 minutes and a great deal. Much better then walking & far cheaper then taking taxi's anywhere. There are three Hiltons in vegas. Make sure that you are clear to everyone that you are going to Grand Vacations. The other two Hilton's are not as nice (and the customer service is AWFUL - I stopped by both of them.) The only small complaint that I have about Grand Vacations is that when I checked out, the front desk clerk was not very nice and didn't say thank you. That was dissapointing because they had done perfectly up to that moment. I assume it was her - because overall the staff was excellent. They have a laundry facility there, but many of their rooms have washer/dryers in the until. There is a store that is a little expensive but really not too bad if you need some staples. All rooms have refridgerators which I could see would come in handy with small children. There is also a huge workout room & rec room with a pool table. Then there are all the great pools.

What a wonderful and comfortable place. We are time share owners at another property and exchanged one of our weeks for our stay here. I must say that after reading some of the previoius positive reviews, I certainly am in agreement. We stayed in Tower 2 (newer...less than a year old) and couldn't have asked for more. We had a 1BR unit which was large and quite comfortable. The unit was beautifully decorated with all the amenities one could ask for. Again having read previous reviews, I was led to believe that the small food market at this property was extremely expensive. Absolutely not so from my standpoint. Grant it, items were a bit more than your average grocery store, but that is to be expected. It was ideal for small breakfast items and even tasty sandwiches. The only drawback (and I'm not certain this is one), is that you have to walk to the closest casinos, those being the Riviera and the Sahara. (I'm not counting Circus Circus which is really the closest one). There's a bus called The Deuce which goes up and down the strip from downtown all the way to The Luxor on the north end. It's $2.00 each way or $5.00 for a 24 hr pass. It stops just a bit away from the front entrance of the Hilton. We received a morning USA Today each day and were never pushed about attending their 2-3 hr time share presentation. We were asked but politely declined. My only complaint would be that the Hilton could at least have a complimentary shuttle that runs between the Grand Vacation site and the Hilton Hotel & Casino. One could walk it, but we didn't. I would think that the Hilton family would want to keep that money with one of their casinos, versus having their guests take their money elsewhere.

It is at the North end of the strip between the seedy Stratosphere and seedier Circus Circus, but once this end of the strip catches up with the rest it will be in a good area right in the middle of the action.

So I booked this room through Hilton'w website well in advance. With a AAA discount a 1 bedroom King Suite was just $101/night. There is no casino, it was non-smoking and there was so much room that it was perfect for me and the two children to hang out in while Dad worked. It is located on the North end of the Strip nearly across from the Sahara. Far enough away from the glitter and debauchery of Vegas that I was comfortable there with my two small children. Just north a few miles is a great children's museum and a natural history museum (as homeschoolers, we were in heaven) Valet parking is $6 so we self-parked behind the building. It's tricky as they have valet roped off. Tip: Pull into the Hilton then immediately bear right. Follow the drive and turn at your first opportunity to go left. If you can park in the first few rows in that area the handicap entrance (you need your key card) is right in front of you. The Marketplace, gameroom, gym and elevators and spa are all on this ground level. We arrived around noon and check-in was pleasant. We were in Tower 2 on the 4th floor. It was quiet during the week, but by the weekend the elevators which we were near got a bit noisier with use. Still not a big problem--and at night we slept with a white-noise machine so it didn't matter much. The area is laid out in a square divided into fourths. One fourth is the kitchen. One fourth is the living room. One fourth is the master bedroom and one fourth is the bathroom. The place was huge. You enter the suite into a full kitchen with full size appliances, with an excellent assortment of dishes and utensils and a washer/dryer combo. This was great with the kids and after a previous 5 day tour of AZ & NV. There is a work desk with high speed internet hook-up, but you must check out a cable if you don't have one. Dial up ISP is charged $1 as a room call unless you dial out a 1-800 number. There is seating for 4 at the dining table and the livingroom has a pullout sofabed, upholstered chair, flatscreen tv, DVD player and a chest of drawers, endtables and lamps. The sofabed was VERY difficult to set up. It pulled out in an akward way and then I really strained my back pulling it out fully. It was rather hard too. My 7 year old wanted to know why it wasn't as soft as the one we had had the night before at an Embassy Suite in Flagstaff, AZ. But for two little children who don't weigh much it was fine. It might be uncomfortable for an adult over several nights. But it was plenty big enough to sleep two adults or teens also. I comfortabley fit between a 7 and 4 year old with room to spare. The tv took some time to figure out. You have to turn it on manually first, then push the \"TV\" button on the remote before you can switch channels. The kitchen was great with kids. We saved a ton of money by going to a grocery store a few minutes away and cooking our own dinner. The flat-top stove heated to just the right temperature, the frig was full size and could hold milk and sodas, etc. The sink was huge but didn't drain, the disposal was clogged so it had to be repaired. The king bed was so comfortable I hated to leave. The pillows were fluffy and the drapes were unbelievable. I don't think I've ever seen drapes so dark. It was great to have the children sleep until 9 or 10 am because it was so gosh darn dark in the room. When you opened them it was really a surprise to see daylight. They were great. In the bedroom was a large chest of drawers, a tv (not flatscreen), two end tables, a chair and a huge garden tub. At first we did not have a drain plug so they had to bring us one. Then later that night when we went to take a bath, the cold water handle seemed stripped and we could not turn off the water. We managed to turn it off at the main valve behind the tub in the wall until maintence could fix it the next day. The bathroom had a huge walk in tiled shower, long vanity and Crab Tree & Evelyn toiletries and a hairdryer. My only complaint is that there were not enough towel racks. Most of the new ones were rolled up in cubbie holes under the beautiful sink, but it was tough to find a place to hang up towels from four people each night. We draped them over the tub and shower. Over the toilet was one small rack as well as on the shower door. That was it. The water also took a bit to heat up, but, boy, when it did, it was scalding hot. The cleaning staff was pleasant. Even though the policy book stated that the room would only get cleaned every third or fourth day, we came home to fresh towels, made beds and washed dishes each day. There was even a little pizza stain on the bed sheet I had covered up to hide, but the next day I noticed it was gone. Evidently they had stripped the bed. My husband's work kept him longer than expected and we tried to get an additional night added to our stay. We had already booked 3 nights and needed a fourth. At first we were told there were no rooms available. Then we spoke to one manager who could only give us a room for $189--the going rate--when online I could have checked out and re-checked back in for around $132. A second night manager (Thanks Bob) agreed that since we were already a guest and had booked several days, he gave us a rate of $139 for the extra night. At check-out my husband produced our two work orders for the tub and the disposal expecting to get a little taken off our bill. Instead we got 4 coupons worth $4.95 each in the Marketplace. If my husband had not been in a hurry to get to the airport I would have gone back to complain. With a 2 liter of Coke costing $3.09, a coupon for $4.95 at the market was not my idea of a discount for my tub and sink not working for the first 24 hours. We ended up getting 3 breakfast sandwiches and a bag of Chips A-Hoy cookies with those coupons. I wanted a \"real world\" discount, not coupons for outrageously overpriced food. $20 off my bill would have made me happy. I felt gipped, but we were on a tight schedule and had little time to discuss the matter. Over all that is my biggest gripe. Everything else was superb. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone with children, anyone wanting to relax away from the glitter of the Strip or anyone wanting a true non-smoking hotel without a casino. But if you don't want to pay $189/night and up, book early and join AAA. The $50+ you pay for that will more than make up for the savings on a room here for more than a few nights.", "Date": "October 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis", "Title": "\u201crough checkin but worth it\u201d", "Author": "3katmama", "ReviewID": "UR5900321", "Content": "My sister and I stayed here Sept. 16-20, 2006. I am an owner with HGVC and my home resort is HGCV @ the Flamingo. This was a last minute trip and sadly there was no availability at the Flamingo location. I had wanted to give this property a try since it opened and since this was a short trip vs. our usual week long trip I decided to give it a go. My only complaint is that we had to move rooms once and nearly twice before getting what I had reserved. We had asked for a smoking room and the room they sent us to was clearly marked non-smoking. I called the front desk and they sent a bellman up with keys and directions to the next room. We went down 2 floors and this room also was marked non-smoking. I called the front desk again and after being put on hold it was explained to me that this floor had recently been re-designated a smoking floor and they hadn't taken the signs down yet. I was left wondering if that was the case with the original floor we had been assigned. This was really only a minor inconvenience and caused no ill will. Wow!! What a beautiful room. We had the one bedroom plus unit on the 31st floor in the new tower 2 facing Las Vegas Blvd. I'm still not clear on what made this unit a \"plus\" unit but nevertheless it was amazing. It contained a full kitchen with appliances, dishes, pots and pans, utensils and the works. There was also a stack washer/dryer in a pantry cabinet. The living room contained a fold out sofa that was very comfortable to sit on, an easy chair, plasma tv (52\"?), and Bose theatre surround sound. The dining area which is between the open living area and kitchen area was very nice. The bedroom had a king size bed with a very comfortable mattress, full dresser, large TV and an easy chair. Just off to the side of the bedroom was a large jacuzzi tub and full closet with a safe. The bathroom was very pretty with great lighting. The shower had multiple shower heads, good pressure and instant hot water. There was a large vanity top and drawers and nooks to store your bathroom items. Because we rented this unit on a nightly basis and are members of HGVC we did not receive housekeeping services which was not unexpected. This is only done during full week stays where you receive housekeeping service in the middle of the stay. It wasn't a problem as we were barely in the room anyway and didn't cook or make any messes to be cleaned up. So I have no comment about the housekeeping other than to say that the room was spotless when we checked in. The front desk staff was very polite when checking in and checking out. We used one of the hot tubs on the first evening we were there and it was very nice. We never used the pool. Possibly my only complaint which is only a minor complaint also is that the line for the deli/convenience store in the mornings was ridiculous. We learned to pick up a muffin for breakfast the evening before to avoid the morning rush. They may need more help there in the mornings. The other times of the days that we were there it was no problem. Given a choice, I would still prefer to stay at the Flamingo HGVC because of the location but this property is really beautiful.", "Date": "October 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LA", "Title": "\u201cGreat for families\u201d", "Author": "AHM", "ReviewID": "UR5832492", "Content": "We were two families and stayed there for two nights. pro: Very clean and well kept.

This particular Hilton Vacations Club (there are three in Vegas) is located on the strip, but not within walking distance of the well-known hotels.

There was also a game room with pool tables (I didn't go).

My other complaint is the rooms were pretty noisy between the thin walls and the fact that there was a lot of construction going on.

If you are looking to visit the high-end casino's and the better entertainment, you are going to have to travel a bit. The casino's in the area of this HGVC hotel are the older run-down operations like Circus-Circus, Riviera, Sahara, StarDust & Slots-of-Fun. I like the ability to gamble if I can't sleep at 2am, and I was kind of stuck when that desire hit me one night since there isn't a decent casino close by. Anyway, the positives here far outweigh the negatives. In addition to great rooms the pool is superb and they have a great health/fitness room for those who like to work out.

The room had a microwave and small refrigerator. The only complaint with the room I had was it never seemed like it was thoroughly cleaned . Maybe it was the fact I wasn't leaving a tip, but that shouldn't matter. For parking you can either use the valet and pay $6 per day or use the free self park which is on the back side of the hotel. There is also a very nice deli/grocery store and gym in the lower level of the hotel. I didn't use the pool because the weather was cold, but it looked beautiful. My advice to everyone is to not take the information session about ownership. It's a high pressured sales tour which explains the benefits of time share. As incentive you get $75 in casino chips valid at the Las Vegas Hilton. It's an hour and half of a pushy salesman, who gets nasty when you say \"no\" at the end.

The Las Vegas condo was adequate in looks. Great kitchen set up. Our 30 yr old son nearly broke his back on the pull out sofa sleeper (no better than Motel 6) and our master bed was a close second. Every master bedroom has the jacuzzi bathtub sitting right there, which was unnerving and the only way I used it was to stand in it to look at the mirror to put on my makeup. It was the closest to a mirror I could get. Ridiculous. It does have a safe which was good. The bathroom (we requested) had an enclosed shower and I learned wherever you go to a Hilton, you must request that.
