Self-service kiosks made check-in a breeze. Our room was a king room located on the 17th floor. The elevators could be a long wait sometimes, but it wasn't too bad. The room was nicely appointed with a low sitting bed, a modern chair (not comfy), and a flat screen TV. We were happy with the size of the room (considering this is NYC). The bathroom was small, and the sink was awkwardly placed with a tiny, tiny bowl. You would get very wet trying to wash your face! But all in all, a great room and a good value.

Being on 42nd Street and right next to Grand Central Station makes it excellent for sightseers and other visitors to New York. The issues with the hotel are minor, but numerous, so they cumulative affect was notable. The lobby area was, between 8am and 11pm, swamped with large parties of visitors either waiting to be picked up or generally chatting. This made moving down the one set of escalators to street level a constant battle (the stairs were closed for repairs). And having to break through the packs of smokers standing outside of the main door was a real issue. It ended up as a daily battle. It became even worse when factoring in the number of guests arriving with suitcases. The large groups of smokers also resulted in the lobby and bar area smelling like an ash tray as second hand smoke wafted in. Another issue was having to queue for over 40 minutes to leave luggage on the day of checkout. The lack of space in the lobby and lack of porters meant that the queue snaked around the lobby area. And then we were confronted with having to pay $2 before the porters would accept a piece of 'left' luggage. I suspect that they charge for 'left' luggage because the service is so bad that they can't rely on tips. The 'market place' area was also limited. After paying for a cup of tea we were then told they they were out of tea. It seems incredible that the central food outlet in a hotel this big was so poorly managed and stocked. The final issue was with the room. Whilst the king size bed was good, the bathroom was incredibly small - I'm not sure larger people could squeeze into the gap in which the toilet was located and I had difficulty reaching the toilet paper that was located behind the toilet. The final issue with the room was the interconnecting door.

At midnight when we returned, we had a single rollaway and when we called for another we were told we were only allowed one per room. After arguing with them we were told we would get one right away. At 1am we called again and finally got one. No pillow, one sheet, no blanket, and no blanket for the other rollaway. We asked for blankets and after another epic wait, we were told they had no more. We were exhausted and tired of arguing with them. The next day we left a note hoping for some blankets but they never came by to clean the room so obviously did not get the note. When we called again they sent us a few sheets (after another epic wait).

Having said that, my last stay there was probably my least pleasant one, and there were some glitches. First, upon arriving at about 9:00 pm on a Tuesday night, I was informed that class of the room I had booked well in advance--one with a king bed--was not available, and that I would have to take one with two double beds instead. Because double beds tend to be 6' long and I'm 6'4\", it isn't comfortable for me to sleep in a bed in which my feet hang over the edge--which is why I reserved a king--so I objected to this. The desk clerk did accomodate me, and moved some other unlucky guest's reservation from a king to double beds, and gave me their reservation instead. Upon arriving at my room (on one of the lowest guest room floors--the 14th, if I recall correctly), I was disappointed to see that it was much smaller than the rooms I had been given in the past (though still pretty spacious by typical Manhattan hotel standards), and that dit had only one tiny window facing the center of the hotel that was always in shadows, so even at high noon there was no natural lighting and the room was extremely dark without all the lights turned on. But worse, there was a distinct cigarette smell, despite the room being on a non-smoking floor. I went down to the front desk to notify them of this--not so much to complain as to let them know that the smell was there when I arrived so that nobody accused ME of the being the one to smoke in the room, and the desk clerk apologized and said that he could probably move me to another room the next day, but not that night. He also gave me a $60 food credit to the hotel restaurant for the inconvenience, which was nice, so I enjoyed a nice dinner. The next morning, the smoke smell seemed to be gone, so I didn't ask to be moved. But when I arrived back at the room that night, the smell was back--and that was the pattern the next couple of days of my stay, too. I assume that there is a smoking floor/room directly above or below that one, and the smell seeps in at night when there's been enough smoking on that floor throughout the day, and dissipates overnight when people are sleeping and not smoking. Otherwise, the room was as comfortable and quiet and I have come to expect from this hotel, and as always, you can't beat the location and nearby amenities. Though this wasn't the best stay I've had here, I think this was an abberration, and I won't hesitate to stay here again.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "boca raton, florida", "Title": "\u201cAt The Crossroads of the World\u201d", "Author": "LSK09", "ReviewID": "UR126738197", "Content": "The newly renovated Grand Hyatt above Grand Central Station in New York City is a very exciting place to stay.

The Hyatt is adjacent to Grand Central Station on E.42nd Street at Park Ave. Grand Central has a beautiful marketplace, shopping, and easy acess to trains and subways. And unlike the 24/7 chaos of the Theatre District streets, the Grand Central area stradles Murray Hill and the Upper East Side. And the 42nd St crosstown bus to the Broadway theatres is right outside the hotel's door. As for the hotel itself, check-in was a breeze, and everyone we encountered, from Reception to Club Room Concierge and Housekeepers we passed in the hallway, was very pleasant and helpful. Appearance-wise, lobby has been nicely renovated, as has the Club Room. My folks stayed on the Club Floor, so I can't speak to the other rooms, but their room was spacious byYC standards (king bed, L-shaped sofa, walk-in closet). The bathroom was small, with a decent shower (no tub). There were no views to speak of, due to the height of surrounding buildings. I imagine there might be better views on uppermost floors, but I chose proximity to the Club Room, which is on 16. Hallway and room decor was a little dated, but passable. My folks loved the Club's breakfast. Unlike other Hyatts I've stayed at in the past, this Hyatt's Club went a little light on the afternoon and evening Club offerings. However, when I brought this to the attention of the Front Desk, they immediately asked what they could do to makethings right - and they did.

I was so looking forward to my stay, I had not stayed at this location yet. The lobby is very nice, it is modern looking and attractive though it seemed a little busy. Registration was prompt. However, as a high ranking member of their Gold Passport Program, I was used to asking and receiving upgrades when a better room was available. In this case, I was told that an upgrade was available but for a surcharge. I stood my ground and was then offered the upgrade. Is that policy--to try and get the surcharge? Nevertheless, the upgrade option was rather disappointing, it was 2 rooms but had no desk or work area nor did have a \"comfy chair\". Instead it had what looked like a kitchenette table with a cushioned bench seat and extra TV. So i switched back to my original room. Again it has a modern decor. Room size was pretty good for NYC and bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was also modern. It was a little small compared to the room itself but still functional and fine. My gripes: 1) Why boast to have flat screen HD TV's when all of the TV channels are in regular analog? The picture is actually worse when you try to use an HD TV without HD channels 2) The set up could have used a little more practical design. The desk area has a single outlet and one of the receptacles was taken up by the lamp. The night table also had one outlet and one of the receptacles was taken up by the Ihome clock radio plug which unfortunately obscured the other receptacle. This was not very conducive to the current times where everyone has electronics and is need of places for charging. 3) Personally, I believe the decor is too modern.

Check in was a breeze and we were given a Grand King room on the 26th floor, away from the elevators, and at the end of the hallway. Our room was a nice size (we've paid more for much less space ... it is New York after all), with a sitting area featuring a sofa, table and chair perfect for a spreading out some work papers and a laptop. We had a roomy closet, and a very comfortable bed, the kind you love sinking into after a day out in the city. Nice touch having room lighting and temperature controls built into the headboard, along with individual reading lights. Two windows looked out onto other buildings, but that wasn't a problem. (We only looked out to check sky for weather anyway.) The bathroom was clean, and yes as others will say, a bit on the smallish side. The sink is a little hard to get to, with the shelf directly above it. Shower was good size, with adjustable/sliding showerhead. Shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, hairdryer and toothpaste were provided. Would we have liked a coffee maker in our room? Yes, but coffee was available (as well as many other food items) in the downstairs 24/7 \"market\". We really appreciated the market, when we got caught in rain walking back from a show and grabbed some steaming hot chocolate and some sweets before heading to our room. Our original plan was to stay for only one night, see a show and go. We asked the front desk what it would cost to stay an additional night and it was only $20 more than our rate, and we could stay in the same room. Still a bargain! The Hyatt was running a limited time sale on rooms, and we were able to take advantage of that. (Not bad at all, considering the Orbitz rate was no longer available ... in fact, it jumped back up another $100.) The staff were very friendly and helpful. We went online ourselves and purchased tickets for another show, after consulting with the concierge for suggestions. Hotel brokers can be a bit pricey, so we didn't go that route. The location of the Grand Hyatt is great, right next to Grand Central Station. The Oyster Bar is in the station, just a few turns down a hallway and that alone can be the one single reason to stay here ... proximity to this wonderful place. We walked to the two different theaters with no problem, and in less time than we expected. This was a theater weekend, so sightseeing or shopping weren't our focus but given that, if we wanted to see sights, the Hyatt's location is very convenient. We'll definitely stay here again!

We were a party of 9 all travelling together. The hotel was perfectly situated right on 42nd Ave, yards from Grand Central Station. On arrival the hotel was ok, not as grand as I'd expected but ok. At checkin it emerged that we had been put on different floors despite my request that we all be close to each other. Eventually this was resolved and they managed to find us a floor where we could all be together. The first thing I noticed was that there were no tea and coffee making facilities in any of the rooms, the second was the smell of damp in all 3 rooms, The rooms were ok, not as clean as I would have hoped for and thankfully there was no sign of bed bugs - we did look, the bed was really comfy though. The staff in the hotel Market Place food area weren't very friendly and didn't seem too keen to heat up the baby's food when we asked. I certainly wouldn't reccommend eating there or stopping for a coffee, their chicken nuggets were $2 each (gasp) and when we asked for 2 for the baby, we were told that ther minimum we could buy was 5, $10 for 5 chicken nuggetts! Prior to arrival I called the Hotel restaurant to book our Christmas meal and was told (quite abruptly) that they were too busy to take my booking there and then but that it would be ok to book when we arrived. The day after we arrived we went down to the restaurant to book, only to be told that they were fully booked, but if we went back on Christmas Eve they would find us a table, we did this only to be told that they were full and couldn't sit us for dinner, at this point I was really peed off and in no uncertain terms, made my feelings known. Low and behold they managed to conjour up a table for 9. To be honest come Christmas day I wished we hadn't bothered, the lunch was the worst meal I've ever had in a hotel/restaurant. Not a sprout in site, no parsnips and believe it or not, no roast potatoes. On our plate we had a piece of goose on top of some stuffing with a portion of braised red cabbage to the side and gravy, no colour to the meal apart from brown. Pudding was sticky toffee pudding and ice cream. 2 of our party were vegetarians and there wasn't even a veggie option available, we had to ask for pasta with tomato sauce so they had something to eat. Twice the maid service entered our room in the morning before 8am waking us up to clean the room. I couldn't believe, it before 8 am? We also had an incident where someone entered my son's room while we were out, put his case on ythe bed and rumaged through it, nothing was stolen and the hotel couldn't find a record of an entry to their room. The corridors are quite dirty and food trays are left outside rooms for days, the carpets need hoovering more often as well. Finally, the hotel actually charges $2 per case, if you want to store your baggage there after checkout, they didn't charge in Dubai.

A few things niggled: I was not notified of mail deliveries; I phoned to ask a written message to be delivered to my wife and it did not happen; internet access is around 16USD per day and is not free in the lobby; the room service menu is average (macaroni cheese, that famous comfort food, was not good) and there was a 20 minute queue for breakfast.

For things beyond - well its attached via an enclosed walkway to the shops of Grand Central Station - so hopping a subway, cab or train is easy and quick. I actually loved that GCS is like its own little city -- or really an indoor mall (it reminded me of the underground in Crystal City, VA except GCS is above ground). It has shops (had to scoop up some shoes at Camuto), restaurants, food court, news stands, gourmet market, etc. Everything you might need w/o having to put a coat on in winter, including a ride to wherever else in NY you want to go via subway or train. Restaurants are good, drinks at the Campbell Apt. v. romantic. I never thought a place I would feel most comfortable in NYC running about would be Grand Central Station! I was a little incredulous that you could be right next to GCS w/o noise as other reviews said, but it is true. We stayed on the club level (I think it was 16th fl) and we never heard a sound from GCS, the street, or other rooms. Very quiet so good night's sleep here. Nothing but good things to say. There was a slight mixup with the room on checking in -- we were told on the phone that our Grand Deluxe King was the room with the wood floors on the website, but were informed that this was not true on check in. They did do some checking and after a bit of hassle put us in the large king with the wood floors afterall. We were very happy about that.

After reading reviews I was slightly concerned but I cannot fault the hotel at all. Its in a fantastic location within walking distance of major attractions and direct access to Grand Central station which is an attraction itself. We checked in using the automated service and were very disappointed with our room due to its gloomy location. We asked for another room and the receptionist was very helpful and although we were 3 hours early for usual check in time she found us a lovely large room with a wonderful view on the 28th floor so it was very quiet. It was light and modern with two double beds. Nothing was too much trouble from any of the staff. They were all extremely helpful and friendly. The concierge gave out good information, very helpful. No coffee machine but when I asked they brought one up straight away no charge. Theres a fridge and safe again no charge like some hotels do. Great shower always hot water. Plenty of toiletries so I dont know how people can complain about that. Who needs them anyway? Good gym although we were too exhausted to use it! Nice cafe around the corner for breakfast and drugstore nearby if you want to fill the fridge with beer, wine,water.The only negatives were the price for internet access although it was free to use for airline check in. Also you have to pay $2 per bag to store your bags if you have a later flight but they are locked away safely. I wouldnt hesitate in recommending this hotel to anyone and cant understand anyone who could find fault. We had an amazing holiday and picked up lots of tips from the guides on the hop on hop off bus tours. Not only are they extremely informative about NY they give great tips how to save money and places to visit. Must things to do are visiting Jersey Gardens which is an outlet with loads of designer shops. About 40 minutes bus ride costing about $11 return. Hollister and Abercrombie and Fitch were almost giving stuff away. We bought over 30 items for around \u00a3130. We were told of a rooftop bar near the empire state building. It was just amazing with fantastic views opposite the empire. There are heaters and red hooded cloaks to wear. I had a manhatten cocktail, pricey but well worth it because of the whole experience. A great eating place is Ellens Stardust diner. The food was good and the atmosphere fun and unique. All the waiters and waitresses are wannabe performers who all take turn to sing great songs as they dance around the room and entertain you. We had dinner and breakfast there and loved it. Half price tickets for shows are best purchased down at the south shore harbour office as there are no queues like Times Square. Phantom was amazing. Tonys Italian restaurant had the most delicious food we ever tasted and very reasonably priced. They serve platters and they will halve them for two people. Planet Hollywoods were also good for breakfast and dinner. We visited Ground Zero. We booked online first, no charge and saved us having to wait around as you go at a set time. It is very moving and emotional though. The tranquil setting makes it very difficult to imagine the carnage that went on there.

We flew in from Heathrow to JFK and decided to transfer in an iconic yellow cab! This was a flat rate $45 plus tolls and it took about an hour. We pulled up right outside the hotel but the name is on the side walls and can only be seen from further down the road so the cab driver had to direct us! Our first impressions were great, open, airy and smart looking. Thank fully we were not dived on by porters hoping for a tip and we got to take our own bags in which was fine as we had little luggage and didn't want to be tipping already - tight I know but we were on a budget. They have a lots of staff milling around but we did find that they don't offer help you have to ask for it. Self service check in desks which were great but very impersonal and rooms are easy to find. They have several lifts up and we never had a problem with them. We were the 17th floor and overlooking the rear roof so nothing spectacular but it was quiet. Our room. This was our first disappointment. It had a nice tiled area immediately as you walk in with a double wardrobe and full length mirror. Going into the room we had two double beds and a bathroom with a half height bath with shower, toilet and basin. This was great until you started to use things.....the toilet was cracked, there were several large chips out of the bath, there was toothpaste dribbling down the shelf, we had to ask for more towels despite the booking being for four, no tea and coffee making facilities, no bottled water or mini bar, ripped bed linen, dirty decorative cushions, only two pillows per bed, the reading light from one of the beds was missing and the hole had been gaffer taped! The rooms also had touch lights and the night light function didn't work. We booked through lastminute.com and wondered if this was one of their allocated rooms and so you get a bit of a raw deal?! It was a shame as in comparison to a four star in the UK and the Hyatt name we were gutted. Arguably we could have complained and perhaps been allocated a new room but we'd checked in at 2.30pm, dropped our bags in the room and went straight out to explore. All of this was discovered on return at 9pm when we were to tired to think about doing anything. The room was clean and liveable so we just got on with it. The location is fabulous. There are doors from the lobby straight into the passage for grand central station and it's within easy walking distance of Fifth Avenue, Rockefeller Center and Times square. Once you start walking there is so much to see it's hard to stop but this place is huge and if you're a keen walker then navigating and distance is so simple once you get the hang of the streets and avenues. However, the subway is also easy and very cheap; they only sell ten trips, weekly or monthly tickets on the subway. The weekly was $29. We didn't eat in the hotel as breakfast was not included in our tariff but McDonalds was just up the road and Pershing Square was almost opposite and although a little on the expensive side it was nice! The hotel had a mini market in the lobby where you could pick up fruit, water, soda, beer, wine, sandwiches, salads, hot drinks etc at a premium but it's convenient. The hotel charge a $2 fee per bag to hold at the hotel for the day. We travelled back to the airport via a shuttle bus that operates just across the road from the hotel. We paid $46 and it goes every 15 minutes. We bought the tickets directly from the bus company but they can be purchased from the hotel lobby.

We liked the idea that you could store your baggage in the lobby (for a fee) until check-in time so you don't have to carry it around NYC with you until you check in. The lines for checking your luggage in the lobby can get overwhelming at times though! We also loved the Market in the lobby, where you can grab a bite to eat or drink. The elevators can be a little confusing since one set only goes up to the 23rd floor. Another set goes beyond, so you need to be aware of which elevator you are boarding. We also liked the fact that it's located right next to Grand Central Terminal, which has many shops and eateries to check out. Also, not far from Times Square!

I think they were going for \"looks nice but doesn't encourage anyone to linger,\" in which case, mission accomplished. I've noticed lots of reviews complaining about the speed of the elevators, however we had no problems. There was almost always an elevator waiting for us whenever we hit the button. We were on the 25th floor and had no issues with street noise. Our room was fine, small, but that's to be expected. The facilities staff was very accommodating and agreed to move a small couch for us so that we could fit in a roll away bed. The man who helped us was very nice and eager to please, he even refused to accept a tip. This was a big difference from the guy who checked us in who was clearly annoyed that we didnt use the electronic consoles. He wasn't exactly rude but he certainly wasn't welcoming. He asked why we were here (exact words..) and when I said \"it's my birthday\" he just handed me the keys. My friend found several suspicious hairs and a few stains on her bed sheets which freaked her out... but she didnt want to complain about them so the hotel never had a chance to fix that issue... does make you wonder how they wash everything though. I'm a platinum member of their rewards club and have spent something like 50 nights at hyatts this year, that plus the fact that this trip was scheduled on my birthday, I sort of expected a little more service.

The hotel was cleaned everyday and we were given new toiletries & towels every day, the room was very spacious with a closet to store cases, iron and ironing board & also a combination safe which you can set yourself. There was temperature control in the room which we didn't actually need as the room was warm enough. We had a view of the street and grand central from our room and the window could open. There is a place to store your luggage upon check out if needed for $2 per bag - although I've never had to pay for this service any where else before I would rather pay $2 than carry my suitcase around all day! There were also some plug sockets in and around the lobby waiting area to charge phone etc which came in handy for us. If you go out the hotel doors to the right and go in the first doors to grand central station take the escalator down to the right - this will take you to the 'shuttle' which is a subway train (there are 4) that only run directly between Times Square and Grand Central which was amazing! We paid $29 for a 7 day unlimited subway pass from which we got our monies worth! This is my 2nd time in NY and I did not use the subway system on my 1st trip as I'm claustrophobic, however the trams are quite big and run so frequently they are rarely too packed to get on, you can get practically anywhere in manhattan in 15 min - journies which would take over an hour by any other means.

We were on 14th floor and were not affected by street noise 4. Air Conditioners were noisy 5. Bathroom was very small and difficult to manouvre in. We are small people and found it difficult. 6. Shower was not very hot and sometimes would take a good minute to warm up. It seemed as though the hot water system was underrated. 7. Basin difficult to use due to shelf above it 8. No tea/coffee making facilities in room 9. Charge for internet usage - hotels need to wake up to what the modern world requires - should be free 10. Didn't eat in the hotel once - the restaurant was too expensive for breakfast. Ate at Pershing Square (100 feet up the road) which was a good meal at a reasonable price. 11.

Well, the room was very small and worse, the sliding doors for the closet were off the track and my husband could not move them back on. He called the desk and they did put us into another room, that was considerably bigger then the first. We were surprised to learn that happy hour didn't include free drinks--infact a glass of cheap wine was $9! On the plus, both the breakfast and appetizers were very nice. We learned on the 2nd day of the trip that the Club was closing the next day. Wish that had been mentioned at the time we checked in!! Needless to say we did not pay for the days when the Club was not available. Although the hotel has recently undergone a massive renovation, it is clear that the \"workmanship\" is very inadequate. We already found wallpaper coming off in the cornors, paint peeling off the door frame. Service is ok, but not anything special. The location is great, right next to Grand Central Terminal and an easy walk to the Theatre District.

The room was however at low floor that receives no sun light, I wonder how many Hyatt Goldpassport VIP was staying that had higher rank than me? The water pressure was extremely low at shower, took twice or trice extra time to wash off soap and shampoo. The location was good but given the fact any hotel located next to a subway station in New York would in fact share similar convinence, so can't really give that much credit. Charging for 1-800 numbers and while asked for an explanation what should such be charged when Hyatt is not being charged, my phone was forwarded to front duck which did not pick up and put through to a voice messsage.

They took the old Trump Hyatt Gold gaudy glitz and buried it.In its place is a world class dramatic lobby of today and tomorrow that clearly is in keeping with more of the Grand Hyatt architecture and design tradition more so of Hyatt International standards. Check in Reception Excellent and highly hospitable with can do anything attitude The new and inspired club lounge inside and out is simply sensational looking. It ranks up there with the slickest looking executive lounges I have seen anywhere in the world. In nice weather they even have an outdoor deck to enjoy the offerings outdoors. Brilliant! The silly dead butterflies on display seem odd to me inside the lounge and I'll assume some decorator\u2019s weird idea of what would go well in the new lounge. The club is now located on the 16th floor (previously the 31rst floor) and only there did they do really do a hard renovation to the hallways and immediate areas entering the club. It\u2019s a welcome refresh. It would have been cool to follow through on every floor.....Relocating the lounge on the 31rst floor was a good idea as the elevators are poor and take a considerably long time to get up to that floor. Especially when the hotel has high occupancy. The hotels elevators are looking worse for wear and they are the same small cramped elevators. One would hope they are slated for replacement or refurbishment. The club lounge closes for breakfast at 9:30 AM in the morning For those of us coming from other time zones especially International guests this seems uncaring and insensitive. The breakfast is satisfactory however the hotel should pay more attention to baking quality and variety of offerings as the previously did in the past. Evening offerings are now very minimal also compared to years past. The beverage selection is outstanding Accommodations\u2019 The folks at check in couldn\u2019t have been more hospitable and welcoming They upgraded me to a nice jr suite as a Hyatt Diamond long time guest Unfortunately it was very noisy on a mid level floor facing 42nd street. I liked my room otherwise. The caring good folks here yet upgraded me further to a quieter larger suite where I had a wonderful one night stay overall after moving. I really appreciated the small refrigerator that they now have in every room! The unexpected upside here to the new rooms is though the bed is a platform (not a fan of such beds typically) it appears Hyatt has indeed found a mattress that can disguise how firm the platform bed really is. One gets a satisfactory enough night\u2019s sleep. Housekeeping overall needs a little more attention to detail. It seems that they are rushed to finish their duties leaving some small unattended concerns. Mind you it\u2019s still in the acceptable range The Grand Hyatt New York Executive Club lounge was in years past the Gold standard of club lounge offerings they do need to step up their game less on presentation which is excellent and more on substance. It would bring me back more frequently. Let\u2019s hope for more continued improvement certainly the hotel has been made more desirable.My thanks to the hotel for recognizing Gold Passport members. This is where the hotel still shines Guest Program recognition. The Hyatt may not be the best choice in town but it still remains on my very possible list every time I come into town depending on rate which frequently can be wildly overpriced. The Grand Hyatt is dependable overall and the location can\u2019t be beat. Experiences will widely vary due to size of property and a very different array of room types. While it\u2019s far from a great renovation it\u2019s an adequate one and a hotel after many years is now looking better. The hotels management has changed a number of times over the course of the years. What's great about the hotel is Hyatt finds some remarkable individuals that always seem to care about the customer with or without issues that can arise. Even though challenges remain at this hotel at times I continue to return thanks to the caring team that helps you to forget this is a large convention hotel with 31 floors and over 1000 plus rooms. Just think how hard it must be to manage all guest expectations. They do reasonably well despite the service bumps along the road. Thank You Grand Hyatt for many years of caring service at the end of the day and taking good care of me! Kudos too for being interactive with your customers/customer service online and off!

Just one thing that I didn't care for: The new lobby - I'm sorry Hyatt, I love you but the new lobby is pretty non-functional. The Jetsons chairs look great but have you noticed that all of the guests have to practically fold in half to get in and out of them, and everyone looks hunched over? I normally love to grab a cup of coffee and a muffin at the Marketplace and sit in the lobby to check my email/messages and get ready for the day - it's something I look forward to usually.

The Gym was great and easy to access. I didn't eat in the hotel as i was so eager to explore the area but the restaurant looked great.

For those who prefer a taxi, you can catch a cab right outside the door. Most importantly for us, the shuttle bus that goes to/from LaGuardia and JFK was literally across the street. It was a simple and cheap way to get to/from the airport. Being connected to Grand Central had a lot of perks, including having several coffee shops and restaurants as well as a food market in the same building. There was a Rite Aid pharmacy and even a MAC Cosmetics in the Grand Central shops as well. The area directly around the hotel had a lot of shopping and a few restaurants and bars. There are more \"nightlife\" type spots a few blocks north and south of the hotel (not exactly walking distance in the winter, but maybe in the warmer months). The hotel itself was very nice. I booked a Queen room, but when we checked in I asked if we could get upgraded in some way and we quickly received a room with a king size bed and a \"view.\" The view wasn't phenomenal, we could see the reflection of the Chrysler building and I think it was the best we could get in that area. The room was definitely big enough for 2 people. (I was worried after reading how small NYC hotel rooms can be.) The room had a closet, ironing board/iron, small couch and table, iPod docking station/alarm clock, hair dryer, toiletries and toothpaste. The best part was the shower. The shower head was a large square with amazing water pressure and felt like being in a rain shower. Honestly, it was probably the best shower I've used in a hotel in recent memory. The only negative comment I have about this hotel is that on the last night we were there, the front desk accidentally booked someone else in our room and issued him room keys. We were watching TV when he literally walked right in. I called the front desk right away and they were very apologetic and offered to move us to a new room immediately. We declined to move since it was our last night and we didn't want to move all of our stuff, but they did make us new keys and the front desk manager was extremely helpful. Aside from that, we had a great stay. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others.

The hotel was cleaned everyday and we were given new toiletries & towels every day, the room was very spacious with a closet to store cases, iron and ironing board & also a combination safe which you can set yourself.

New York has some of, if not the toughest bylaws on smoking in the country. I do not understand why the Grand Hyatt has smoking rooms available for an additional charge. We were told our floor was non smoking. When checking out I mentioned the cigarette smoke in our room again and I was told the guests who were smoking would be charged an additional $250 service charge. Unfortunately, this does not help me. My husband is allergic to cigarette smoke and we experienced four restless and sleepless nights because of the smoke odor in our room. It is not difficult to determine if a guest is smoking in a room and I think management should have been more proactive about speaking to the guests rather than simply dismissing it with a service charge at the end of their stay. Consideration has to be given to the remaining guests on the same floor. I love the Grand Hyatt but I have to say that serious consideration will have to be given for our next visit because cigarette smoke is not acceptable when you are booking what you believe is a non smoking room.

We booked room only so I can't comment on meals etc. Staff are polite, helpful and courteous. The concierge service is open from 7am and they are helpful and can arrange reservations etc - they will also advise if you can get a cheaper service elsewhere eg we wanted to do bus tour and concierge told us that on-street sales-people offer best service and value! We were able to leave our bags after check-out for $2 per bag. My only (very small criticism is the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room.

On a short trip to NYC we found the hotel to be very conveniently located above/beside Central Station and within walking of alot of major sites. Subway located within the building for sites further afield, and the bus to JFK airport for our return trip was located directly across the road which was of great convenience. Our room was on the 20th floor and i can only assume from reading other reviews that our room, which although comfortable and quiet was rather compact as was the bathroom. The main problem encountered was concerning information provided by the concierge for a restuarant relatively nearby (or should have been) that we had made a reservation for. We gave him the restuarant name and the area it was in so that he could google and provide us with an exact address. I appreciate that i should have taken the address or number with me but even with this oversight i didnt think it was too much to expect to be provided with accurate information after he had checked on his computer. The end result was we found ourselves a block and several streets away from where we were due to be and with my wife in high heels on a cold freezing night giving me a hard time was aggravation i didnt need!, Eventually after having to seek directions from numerous passers by on several streets, we ended up almost 45 minutes late but luckily we reached our destination and enjoyed our meal. We did not sample food in the hotel but did have a drink one night (a hot whiskey and a beer) which came to about $24 which i thought was a bit OTT, so didnt return. Overall Our stay went well and these gripes are minor compared to what many other people have to deal with regarding hotels. One final tip would be that there is a great cafe nearby on Lexington Ave.(Scotties) that serves up a mean breakfast at very reasonable prices... So good in fact that we ate there each morning, which set us up well for the day ahead(:.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent service, nice room\u201d", "Author": "Walt61588", "ReviewID": "UR122246893", "Content": "We stayed for two nights in December amd it was very nice.

The reason we chose this hotel was because of the regency club rooms and the lounge. We've noticed over the years the regency club expand, but not the facilities, so we were delighted when we heard of the renovations. Unfortunately, while the lounge has expanded slightly, the number of people with access seems to have expanded exponentially. This is the first year we were unable to stay on the floor of the club lounge(although we are on the old club floor 31) - it used to be that only people on the club floor had access to the lounge - those were good days! In my opinion the club experience has become pedestrian. I may as well go to time square to get my coffee - I'm sure there will be less people. Other things - door man asked if we needed help with luggage, I said yes, and then he helped the taxi driver get the bags out of the taxi, and left them on the sidewalk for us. The room while nice and roomy does not have a desk. There is a fridge in the cabinet, with nothing in it. The new safe has room for my computer, which is nice. The bathroom is the smallest one of any hotel in which I've stayed. The new closets are nice and roomy. The bed is comfortable and the convenience of having ac and lighting controls next to the bed is a plus. The new geneva sound system does not work. The 42 inch tv is lcd but since there are no digital channels, only analog, all of the channels have a light fuzz. It seems that this will end our New Years eve ritual of staying at the Grand Hyatt.

This one was a disappointment like nothing I had faced before. This is the reason why this hotel deserved my lowest rating ever: 1. Horribly rude staff. I remember my husband and I wanted to share the tea we took from the little coffee shop downstairs. The tea was complementary for us but we did not want to take another cup hoping to not waste anything. The guy behind the counter replied in a curt manner 'Sir, in this part of the world, nothing comes free of cost. Fork out the money for an additional cup'. I was ok with him not wanting to give us an additional cup, but that kind of remark was unsavory. While my husband brushed it aside as a typical New York sarcasm, I found it offensive. 2. The rooms are stuffy. They should have a better ventilating system in the rooms. I developed a severe allergy due to tiny particles in the air which would often make it difficult to breathe. I complained about it to the management who got the room inspected and casually added 'It happens some times. We will make sure the room is properly cleaned and fumigated'. I dont know what they did but the discomfort continued for the 2 weeks we were in the room. 3. Bad service - I am a vegetarian. Usually wherever I stay, I ask for customized dishes to be made for me. This usually involves replacing the meat in a dish with veggies. I did not expect to be rudely turned down specially in a place which charges you a bomb! I told them 'I am starving and it is snowing outside, so can you send over some plain rice. I will manage with it.' to which I got 'Sorry mam, we do not serve like that. You will have to order something off the menu' I can go on and on about what a horrible experience it was... They pretty much tried their best to ruin my 2-week trip to NYC, a place I had been wanting to visit ever since I got hooked onto to FRIENDS.. Before I conclude, let us not forget the few pluses: 1. The location is great!!! It is convenient to go everywhere in NYC from this location. This was the only reason why we chose this place and I deeply regret that decision!

Toilet roll holder is on the wall next to the toilet but its behind you so you have to reach round for it - which in the middle of the night can become a bit frustrating!

The rooms are smaller than most in the US, but that is how NYC is in general. We stayed on the club floor with the lounge that provides free food and drinks througout the day. The lounge is opened most of the day and was very nice since it was really cold in the mornings and we didn't have to go scout a place for breakfast. The staff is friendly, in fact one of the front desk clerks even gave me advice of where to move in NYC (since I was moving to NYC for the summer). The person in charge of helping guests find places to visit or eat did take forever and I ended up going to the front desk and asking on getting directions to a museum. The only problem I had was that the TV was fuzzy, the manager of the hotel came in and looked at it but could not fix it. We were given a $75 credit for the issue and we applied the credit to use the internet since that was not free, like most properties like it. The location is great since its literally right above grand central. We had to go to White Plains one day and we were easily able to get to the Metro North (took only like 10 min to actually get on the train from the lobby). The subway is also really easy to get to as well. However, if you are visiting for the first time, be warned that in the morning and at rush hour it is hectic in this area but that is to be expected. Also, you can walk directly west on 42nd to times square, or take the shuttle from grand central to the times square station.

The hotel is very cold (colors and attitude, not temp). With automated check in we were here three nights before ever having a hotel employee acknowledge us (at check out... and barely... and after a 15 minute queue.) I understand it is a large convention type hotel, but not exactly any hospitality. Better hotels are able to bridge this gap. Hotel recently remodeled, and rooms were nicely decorated, but we had two basic problems. One, tv picture was very fuzzy. Two, one day copious amounts of smoke came in through the bathroom fan (nasty neighbors I guess.) Ick. Ick. Ick. (On n/s floor). What really ticks me off is the 12.95 per day for internet. This is unacceptable and a blatant rip off. For the rate charged for the room, inclusion of this now basic service is expected. I hate getting nickel and dimed. Also a charge for storing bags... again, usually a basic service I am more than happy to tip for but don't expect having to pay up front. Yes, I know this is NYC but that isn't an excuse. Location is pretty good. Hotel is adjacent to Grand Central Terminal and there is a back passageway so can get to the trains and several subway lines. Also there is a market in GCT. This was very nice. We did lots of exploring by foot and didn't see a lot of hotels with significantly better location. Happy with this. Breakfast at hotel was 60 for two. Yeah, we found better for much better value the other days. My bad, but still rip off for rip off's sake. (Don't get me wrong, I am not cheap, but I can tell when I am being ripped.) Beds very comfy. No complaints there. All in all, this is the first time Hyatt has let me me down. It just... should have been better in a couple of basic ways. You know, any of these little things I could probably overlook if I felt they appreciated my business at least a little.

I can start by saying that they gave us a room facing a wall f other rooms windows, which made privacy an issue. The room has a good size and new nice decor, but the light and A/C system is a mess and the housekeeping is very poor for a four star, leaving things dusty, forgetting things out of place and leaving behind dirty pieces of linen on the room floor! The hotel forces you to call the room operator just to tell we want our towels to be changed daily: isnt enough to place the towels in the floor like in other hotels? I hate to be forced to save the planet, speciallly when I have payed a lot to spend little time in a hotel! Check in and check out were quick, but the stiff cold concierge has came up with a ridiculous price for a transfer to JFK, totally incredible in comparison with many other times we have used that kind of service in New York. And last but not least, the location in the East side is not so good to move around in Manhattan as it is in the west side of midtown, since the Lexington subway lines are a perpetual crowd in comparison to other subway lines.

We have been to New York many times before and stayed in many other 4 star midtown hotels, however we had picked the Hyatt this year because of its great location. We were a little concerned before we arrived about the renovations, as had seen a few negative reviews on here, but on arrival we were definitely not disappointed! We were met in the lobby and ushered through to check in quickly and easily. The lady who checked us in was much friendlier than anyone who has ever checked us in before in NYC. We were celebrating my mum's 60th birthday and I had let the hotel know, so they immediately wished her happy birthday and had champagne and strwaberries dipped in chocolate sent up to the room! The room itself was beautiful. A standard room, but large, newly refurbished, bright, spacious, with comfy beds and an amazing view of the Chrysler building. Throughout the stay the room was quiet and the hotel was a true haven of peace in the middle of a lot of hustle and bustle! Just what you want in NYC. The location is second to none, much better than Times Sq (in our opinion) as you are nearer to downtown and also out of the bright lights and mayhem of Times Sq, but still only a 5 minute walk away. Grand Central food hall and restaurant complex is downstairs (you don't even have to walk outside to get to it) and there are some great options for food, snacks or coffee in there. So now onto the small detail that let them down. On checkout we queued for at least 35 minutes and didn't move. The queues were astounding. Yes, it was a busy day, but there were empty workdesks where we could have been checked in if there were staff there and the staff who were checking in were chatting away to the people (for 20 + minutes) they were checking in, paying no heed to the growing queue. We nearly missed our bus to the airport because of this! Finally, when I got to the front of the queue, the operative informed me that I had nothing to pay (I knew we hadn't had any extras but always like to hear that on check out). 4 days later on checking my card bill, I had been billed $900 by the hotel. The room had already been paid for in full, so I have spent the past few days liaising with British Airways, who I booked the hotel with. I also called (at my cost) and emailed the hotel and granted they were helpful and said the money would be returned to me as it was their error. But who has $900 spare before Christmas? And it took over 5 days to be retuned...and I am now \u00a310 short due to exchange rates so I am now having to scan in my statement and send over to BA. What a waste of time!

Next to the Grand Central Terminal, a 10 minute walk to Times Square, 15 minute walk to the Empire State Building... close to everything! CONS: *Charging for wireless Internet access in the room. It seems like these days free Internet access should be a given. If Comfort Inn can do it, why can't the higher end hotels? *No coffee machine in the bedrooms. It would have been nice to have a coffee in bed instead of having to get dressed and get coffee at the store in the lobby. *Housekeeping: -The room wasn't as clean as it could have been. It wasn't horrible, but there was hair in the tub and soap remains in the shower. It seemed like the cleaning staff were in a bit of a rush. We would have expected more from a Hyatt Hotel. -The least enjoyable aspect of our stay was being woken up at 8:30AM on a Saturday morning by the VERY LOUD cleaning staff while they were working.

When we arrived there was still work going on in the lower lobby area. The lobby itself is vast - more like a airport than a hotel - very sleek and minimal with museum like rows of seats. We were quickly checked in and received excellent and friendly service - just what was needed after a hideous long flight. Our rooms (25th Floor) were spacious with 2 queen size beds in each, a small seating area and a small bathroom. The one thing lacking were drawers for storage - there is a decent sized closet with plenty of hanging space but no drawers apart from 2 in the central bedside table, As a consequence I had to keep things in my suitcase on the couch. The shower was great when we got it to work but it was an art trying to work out how to use it and how to get the right temperature. In the UK we're used to having tea and coffee making facilities in hotel rooms and I missed this in the morning - I didn't appreciate having to get up an dressed and go down to the Market to get my first cup of the day. We didn't have breakfast included in our rate so it would be nice to have a coffee / tea maker. We didn't venture to the restaurant / shops during our stay as they're a bit hidden away behind the lobby - we found the shop on the last day and it looked good value compared to others we;d found in the city. We had a drink in the bar - a bit pricy compared to other bars but was fine and service was good, quick and efficient. We got a good rate for the hotel through Expedia (\u00a3225 per night) which compared to other hotels was pretty reasonable,. Overall would I stay again? Probably at this price, not if it's more expensive.

The room itself was pretty large, with modern brown colours. The bed was very comfortable and a good size flat screen TV. We had to move rooms because our shower was broken, so when we left for the day we packed our belongings and the hotel said they would have it all taken to the new room when we got back.

They eventually found a room, but did not have a bath as was requested. So went downstairs and again no record of any request. We eventually found a room (without a bath) And said that was fine - service at breakfast was extremely poor, the people were blunt and rude, we requested a spoon for the oatmeal, it never arrived.

Let me run through the different ways in which the staff DIDN'T make our stay memorable: 1) We arrived at 11pm. Upon checking in, we were told that there was no water available in the rooms for showering as the hotel was connected to Grand Central Station and necessary water works were being carried out there overnight. Why this was happening the night before a long weekend didn't make any sense to me but fine I can understand that this was out of their control. Why then did they not notify me earlier about this? They had all my contact details - surely a mass email would have been better service so customers can make other arrangements IF it was a true inconvenience to them. 2) The person at check-in also mentioned that tap and toilet would be working. We went upstairs and they didn't work. So no ability to wash our face or use the bathroom. Not ideal for someone who has just traveled into town. We called, the lady assured us that we could get another room without too much trouble so I went back down to sort that out. 3) There was a long queue but 1 staff member was standing by himself. I told him the problem and he went to a backoffice for about 5 mins, came back out and told me couldn't help me and that I would have to queue up. He clearly didn't understand that at midnight, after traveling for 5 hours, a customer may be a little tired and cranky at having to change their room. 4) After queuing for 20 mins, I finally reached a front desk agent who immediately apologized and then told me that there were no rooms available. I told him that it was unacceptable to not even have working toilets in our room so he said he'd look again. Lo and behold, he found a room (after 15 mins of tapping on his computer and going to the backoffice to consult with his manager). The impression I got is that the only rooms with water were the more expensive rooms - rooms they were unwilling to give other customers. 5) The next day, after doing a round of shopping, I asked the concierge to have my bags delivered to my room while my wife and I went out for dinner. He gave me a flat \"no, it's not the hotel's policy\". No apology, no attempt at finding another solution. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again.

This was a Dream Come True for me. I had imagined the hotel to be awe-inspiring, luscious, modern, yet with a tip o' the hat to the Grand Central Station roots. I don't know WHY I expected I expected what I did...but I did not expect what I got. Backing up, our night at the Grand Hyatt New York was the second of the two free nights we received for getting a Hyatt Visa card. Our two-night trip was a combination Mini-Moon (we got married @ Hyatt Regency Boston...Love them. XOXO) and 40th birthday trip for my wife. We wanted to stay 2 nights a the Grand Hyatt, but it was out of rooms of the class we were eligible for, so we had to \"settle\" for the Andaz 5th Ave. See my other review. So...I had interacted via social media with the Grand Hyatt folks and learned we could check bags if our room wasn't ready. What social media did NOT mention was the fee ($5 or less) per bag for the bell stand to check a bag. (As an aside, this hotel has the Most Awesomely Responsive social media folks. The social media was, I think, the BEST part of the hotel. But I digress.) We got in line to check in...and there was a line. The lobby, under construction, was PACKED with people.There were two front desk staff, keeping their calm despite the lines of people wanting their attention. Two concierge staff joked with each other and answered questions, sending people either to the bell stand or to the line for the front desk folks. A Diamond Gold Passport Member was ahead of us in line. I know he was a Diamond because he said it a couple of times, frustrated that the desk staff didn't ignore the long line of Not-Diamond people to help him. Fortunately we could get into a room, so, with great anticipation, we entered our slightly upgraded room. Small and dark. That sums it up. Small and dark. We came from Bright, Cheery Andza, where we were treated to snacks and beverages. We were faced with the single bottle of water with that tag that says something like \"Drink me!!! We will add $8 to your bill!!). To be more objective, the room was much like those pictured on the website...but darker. There is a little fridge hidden in the lovely new built-in furnishings. The rooms were all just upgraded, so they are spiffy, for small and dark rooms. It felt like a cruise ship cabin, the kind with a balcony, only there was no balcony or ocean. We had been given coupons to get a couple of beverages from the handy 24 hour market. We got water & coffee. Ok, I got coffee. I love good coffee.The coffee was pretty good. Before going to the Grand Hyatt, I had fantasies of exploring every nook and cranny. Once I made it through the crowded lobby, I did not want to see the rest of the hotel. WAY too many people in a smallish space for my liking. The Good News: My yearning to go to the Grandest of Hyatts, the Grand Hyatt in New York, has been satisfied. The Bad News: I expected more. After the trip, the nice social media people tweeted me, wishing us a safe trip home.

The room itself ( \"premium\"???) is sparse. no work desk; no bathrope, no slipper. No ammenities like nail file or cotton buds. No stocked minibar or complimentary drinking water... But... they charge over $30 for internet access. Per device! per day! Having 3 mobile devices this alone would be a \"deal killer\" for my next NYC stay. Loud in the room, noise form the hallway is like the doors are made from paper. remote for the radio next to the bed? didn't work .. (so I took the battery out in the morning and put the remote (and battery) on the nightstand for the maid to fix. Found it at the same place in the evening... still not working. The two glasses provided in the room? Not even looking clean... But getting better... tonight (at 10 pm) they turned of the water supply for \"urgent repairs\". No offer to change rooms... some some bottled water to brush teeth was offered. What to do after the workout .... ? get to bed without a shower...? And not be able to flush the toilett until the morning...? come on... you can't rent such a room (and sure not on these rates).

In fact, looking at the layout of this un-grand hotel, more than half of their rooms are each facing inside against each other with no view at all. Problem starts very shortly with the lousy house keeping...found out there is no shampoo and bath products even we checked into the room. Had to call the house keeping 3 times before they send the correct items to my room (and had to tip them for their mistakes as well). I kinda suspect that the previous person that check out didn't leave tip, so the house keeping don't bother to top up the tolietries. I did an experiment over the next 2 days... on 2nd day, I purposely didn't leave a tip (since they didn't do a good job when I check in anyway), the housekeeping did a very terrible job and didn't replcae any tolietries. On the 3rd day onwards, I left tips of a few dollars and they will then top up the tolietries, but the standard of cleaning is still very poor as I can still broken pieces of wood from their furniture left there for a few days. They say that a heary breakfast is a good way to start your day - but the breakfast there seems to spoil the rest of my day. First, very long queue for breakfast. They probably have less than 80 seats available for a hotel that 'boost' of more than one thousand rooms. Then the waiting staffs have bad attitude and still expect 15% tip for bring 2 plates of food and drinks that cost around 60 USD for breakfast!. To make it worse, they even charge us extra for items we didn't consume THRICE!!! The first 2 times I spot it and raised it the staff and front office to resolve. the 3rd charge , i only discover after I went back home and check my crdit card statment to see that they have charge me a second time for my prepaid breakfast. Just ridiculous that they overcharge me 3 times in 7 days! Coincidence that it is so careless so frequent ? Or just plain dishonesty? You decide... Also, there is rennovation noises throughout the day at the moment so please feel free to dine at their 'fantastic' resturant if you prefer drilling noise ...and also a likely chance to be overcharged by the bad attitude staffs there. And the rooms have this 'intelligent' lighting and cooling system that is actually soooo stupid. Not user friendly at all...and it beeps frequent in the middle of the night to ensure your sleep is disturbed further, as if spoling your day thorugh poor breakfast service and dirty rooms / horrible housekeeping isn't bad enough, To be fair, this hotel has a very good location and a few of the front office staff were quite nice. So I reallt think the management should seriously look into the house keeping slackers and the waiting staff for breakfast. Considering they are a 4 star hotel, the standards here is definately not up to expectations at all.

Results are mixed. As customary at Hyatt, the staff are wonderful. The beds are extraordinarily comfortable, the rooms quiet, the air system responsive and effective, the shower/tub design and materials accessible and secure, the elevators accessible and fast. This has the basic ingredients of a fine Hyatt hotel. Unfortunately, the excellence of this hotel is undermined by user unfriendly aspects of renovation design. Drawer space for clothes is insufficient, as are shelves and hooks in the bathroom. The toilet is dangerously close to other accoutrements. The hot water tap in the bathroom sink dribbled at best. The futuristic clock radio, while white, was an unusable black box. The light switches should come with a manual. The mattress foundation sticks out below the wonderful mattress and barks shins with its hard, pointed corners. The aesthetics of the renovation are dramatic and often interesting, but the predominance of white in rugs all over the hotel ends up displaying dirt as much as design. Although the hotel clearly offers alternatives to traditional check-in and check-out desks, the lineups for both were still enormous some times of day. The hotel solicited our use of internet check-in, which was then refused when we tried to use it. On manual check-in the room type confirmed was not available, leading to the need for housekeeping to provide alternative furnishings for the room allocated. The hotel location next to Grand Central Station on 42nd Street and across the street from airport buses on Park Avenue is superb, but the interface of the hotel itself with cars and taxis is both confusing and nightmarish. Lots of good food in the hotel and its surroundings.... For these positive and less than positive attributes, the Grand Hyatt charges the high level of room rates typical of upscale Manhattan hotels. Hyatt is typically generous in its senior citizen discounts, but the base rate is rising quickly in the Grand Hyatt, as elsewhere. The question is whether the attributes of fine hotels are being delivered more fully elsewhere by the competition.

The lounge was of very high standard with white leather sofas, wooden floors, large TV and an extra bathroom, however the movie channels could not be accessed from this TV (problem with the set-up I think). The next day the maid came in to my room twice even though I had the privacy button on and my note about the Movie channels not working was ignored. It also cost me $25.00 for 2 days internet access, breakfast (which is limited to a drink and ONE of the following; toast, cereal or croissants) was supposed to be included in my room, it wasn't, I ordered breakfast in my room and for $25.00 I got a pot of coffee and two of the smallest croissants I have ever seen, when I queried the inclusion of breakfast at reception I was told it was not detailed on my booking, after showing them my confirmation slip that showed I had booked the 'awaken package' they told me they would credit my bill with $15.00 towards the hotels market place food store (incidently the Awaken Package was not registered on my booking a couple of years ago when I stayed at a Hyatt in Dubai either, on that occassion the waitress chased me through a very busy reception area when she thought I had not paid and it was highly embarassing) the following day I received my check-out invoice and there was no $15.00 credit for breakfast I queued at reception for 15 minutes to go through the story again and get the credit, I then waited around 15 minutes to use the ONE PC in the reception area that you can print boarding passes at and then a further 15 minutes in the long queue to be seated for breakfast before deciding to give up and go to the shop and buy myself a coffee and croissant. Already feeling slightly annoyed by this point, I returned to my room to find that the maid had again ignored the privacy button and was stripping the bed even though I clearly had 1.5Hrs before check-out and my belongings were visibly still in the room, I asked her to leave and come back later which she did. When checking out I used the self-service portal because the reception area was chaotic, there are very few seats for guests waiting for taxi's etc...and if you want to store your bags while you wait it is $2.00 per bag which I feel is innapropriate when considering the cost of rooms at this hotel.

No one helped me out of my cab with our luggage (2 bags and a stroller with a 8 month old). The room was small and very dirty duvet was stained by droll and had been turned inside out to cover it. The bathroom shower had tile that was poorly done so the water stood at your feel instead of draining. Our sink's drain was backed up (not good when you need to clean your baby's bottle.)

After a hour and a half I gave up and ordered blindly from room service. Three hours after I ate someone brought a menu up waking up my sleeping kid. We went to the concierge to rent a private car because getting a cab at that hotel was impossible. He wanted $111 an hour! They were under contract to rip us off, I guess. With the Ritz hotel I never paid more then $80 an hour. I went to the bell men who helped me get another car. The hotel elevator is a death trap and lawsuit waiting to happen. We tried to get in one and it started to close. My husband put his hand in, it failed to stop, so put his leg in... it clamped down hurting him.

The Hyatt has always been our first choice as we had lovely times in Sharm and Hawaii with this hotel brand. The Grand Hyatt in NYC did not disappoint for a city hotel. 1/ Location: next to Grand central terminal so it was convenient for the metro and easy to find. It is only 10 mins walk away from Broadway/ Time Square. 20mins to Bloomingdales/ 5th avenue/ Penn station/ Macy's. 2/ Comfort: we expected a little room with miminal space but this was not the case. Our room was relatively spacious with a couch and a king size bed, plus plenty of room for suitcases and shopping bags :). Our room did not have a view but that didn't bother us as we were only there to rest and recharge our battery for the next day. Our room was recently refurbished so all was clean and fresh. The only downside for the ladies is that there is only one mirror in the bathoom. Lucky my striagtener cable was long enough for me to do my hair in front of it. 3/ Hotel service: Majority of the staff were very nice and friendly, thank you to Veronica who upgraded us for free of charge. There was one or two individual less helpful (friendly) at the concierge desk but all in all was very good. 4/ General: It was nice of Hyatt to give us 2 vouchers pp to exchange for tea/ coffee/ water at their store, this was a nice touch from them expecially after a long day of travelling, made us felt very welcome. There were 2 downsides: firstly; wifi. It is hard to believe a hotel like Hyatt does not provide free wifi when even Bloomingdales and Au bon pain (nice breakfast) do! The cost of wifi is $9.99 per day but for a couple like us, we didn't need an all day service, we just need to look up a few things on the iphone before we set off for the day. Secondly, luggage storage. The Grand Hyatt was the first hotel I have been that charges you. We checked out at 9am and our flight wasn't till much later so we left the luggage with them while we have our last day out in NYC. The cost is $2 per bag, we had a hand luggage and a suitcase each so $8 in total. The cost is not expensive but we were surprised at it as we've never been charged for luggage storage before. Overall, I'd recommend this hotel, we had a lovely time staying there. The cost to stay there was not cheap but well worth it.

Once you hit the street, it's busy busy busy with lots of cabs and doormen blowing whistles and people rushing back and forth to work.

Space is, of course, at a premium in NYC, and a number of hotels I have seen or stayed in call a glorified 150 square foot closet their deluxe room. Not so, the Hyatt. The room was long and narrow, as hotel rooms often are, but it was normal-sized by any other city's standards, and giant by New York's. It's possible that you get more space in the standard room with 2 queens rather than one king, so request that if you are concerned with space. The bathroom truly is the size of a postage stamp, but the shower's nice, and you don't spend that much time in there anyway. The decor is sleek and modern, with dark wood. The wood was a little scratched and beat up, despite the recent renovation, but I didn't care, because there's a window that actually OPENS!! I asked to be on a high floor on the front of the building for the view, and even though I was 33 stories above the street, it's a busy -- noisy -- street.

Claudine made a few phone calls and said our room would be ready shortly.

The lighting controls are smooth soft-touch plates with markings on them (and various places to touch for \"all on / all off\" or \"entry lighting\"). These have all sorts of problems built in, including it being nearly impossible to set reasonable lighting for certain purposes (like turning off all the lights except a reading light and a light in the bathroom). Added to this seems to be a timer that turns everything off after a while (whether you're still there or not). They also put in a sophisticated clock/radio/ipod dock that was so hard to deal with that it wasn't set to the right time when I arrived (if you could even tell it was a clock) and at the same time had two sets of instructions in the room. Clearly this place is trying to look high tech, hip (very much like a W hotel), and cool, but in the process it has make it less warm, comfortable, and usable. The second part of my bad experience was related to having business meetings here (on the mezzanine level). Not only wasn't there a bathroom on the level, but hotel security wouldn't let several of us use the men's room on the next level (the ballroom level) because they were limiting access to badged attendees of another event (this was enforced at best sporadically, since others from our group weren't stopped), and I feel it is simply unacceptable to have no nearby rest room and then close access to the closest one (without notice).", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, invisible staff\u201d", "Author": "Platinum2709", "ReviewID": "UR118338281", "Content": "I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for ten days.

My advice, if you need to travel alot on subways, trains.buses, BUY a one WEEK ticket at a cost of US29.00 It is worth every penny cost a single trip would cost you $2.25 you can buy multiple journey trips in one card and also for as many person as you like. You will need ot buy it from a clerk who man the booth near the subway entrance. They usually accept cash only. also, NO newspaper for hotel guest. Will I stay again? Yes if it is a good deal.

With my status with Hyatt, I was upgraded to a corner king, mini-suite. I really appreciated the extra space. Here were some of my challenges with the hotel: 1. Shower door didn't close properly. Therefore, water was being sprayed out to my tiny 48 square foot bathroom. 2. Light next to the TV in my bedroom doesn't turn off, not yet programmed into the room auto lighting system. Couldn't find the plug so had to wear an eyeshade all night. Thank goodness I had one. 3. The phone next to my bed was not properly installed so I had to go to the phone in the living room to answer the phone. No more wake up calls. 4. Service in the restaurant was SOOOO slow. Our server was almost non-existent. We were helped mainly by a different server. Hope he got the tip instead. 5. Charged for everything. What was worst was that each attendant quotes a different price... what is up with that? 6. Meeting space was outdated and had a funny smell to it.

We usually request this location for the room in order to have some view. Although sitting over a busy street the noise does not bother us because the insulation is very good. More importantly the bed in a renovated room is super comfortable. It is more comfortable than their mid-town competition - whoever selected this kind of bed should be promoted!! I appreciate hotel's relatively new internet provider - no more numerous logins as before - just once would do and the speeds are close to 3Mbs. Another feature I love is the Geneva ipod dock and radio in the room. The sound is truly fantastic. If you like it too, one can get it from a MOMA store!! Apart from the new furnishings, renovated rooms also have touch-sensor lighting. I found it cool, to be in control of it from the bed. While the bathroom remained small, it feels much brighter and only has a shower rather than a tub. The only negative of the new design is a wooden shelf running above the sink and below the mirror. You need to remember of it if you need to wash your face with your eyes closed and need to lean over the sink not to end up bumping your head into it. Another negative is their TV system. While a flat panel TV is of a good size, their channel guide is hidden behind numerous screens, and some channels far from being hi-def have snowy view. Much prefer Starwood's TV system over Hyatt's: I don't need to browse for half an hour just so as to locate a channel a need. I understand that Grand Hyatt is not \"luxurious\" enough to provide printed channel guide in it's rooms, but I would be surprised if one of their focus groups have not specified to them about the importance of this. Personally I will stick to iphone steaming over the Geneva.... During our stay Club Lounge usually accessible for extra fee or to Hyatt elite guests was closed for renovations with the new lounge on 16th floor slated to open in September. Hyatt offered complimentary breakfast to Platinums in their renewed restaurant sitting above 42nd street. The restaurant decor is very nice, modern, airy and comfortable. Breakfast food, only available a la carte, was good, nicely presented and flavorful. Ordered crab omelet one morning, and was hard pressed to find any crab in it; a far cry from their old restaurant /menu which offered generous servings of crab in a crepe...

The bathroom lightswitch, while touch sensitive, wasn't properly attached to the wall, the woode surround to door frames etc wasn't finished neatly, use of wooded soap dishes in the bathroom that already had a very used feel to them, etc. I was also pre-charged $100 for incidental expenses despite the fact that the only thing I purchased was a 24 hour wifi access. This led to an almost embarrasing situation the day I checked out as I had no idea this bogus charge (I'm told to be credit sometime in the next week) had been applied to my account.

I was pretty disappointed with this one. It was clean and had the great little coffee shop downstairs and was in a good central location, but there were some serious service glitches and the bathroom was so small it was ludicrous for a room that is in the high three hundred range. I used points, but it took alot of them and in the past I have been treated much better in using my points. First, I was charged as a no show when there was a note in my reservation that said I was coming in on the red eye AND I had phoned the evening before to be sure all was in order with the late check in - I tried to check in via internet but for some reason that service was unavailable so I double checked by calling and spoke with a human who assured me it would be fine to show up the next morning and that everything was in the file. The first front desk person to check me in greeted me with a \"you were supposed to be here yesterday.\" I pointed out there was a note in the reservation, and she gave us the room but I guess she did not correct the no show notation and it was not until I was checking my bill the last night that I caught the $163. charge. Luckily the woman at the desk that night had originally taken my reservation and she corrected it. But why should it take three tries to get something that simple right? Then, when I was shown to my room it was miniscule and recently renovated a horrible dark grey/brown. Really, it was back to the seventies and not in a good way. I went down and got a slightly better room but as someone else commented, the bathroom is the size of a tiny closet with no room to put toiletries of any amount - not enough for a couple for sure. No BATH. Just a shower. Really. Hideous mural behind the bed. The lights are some weird touch pad. My husband is a techie and I am not impressed by gadgets that don't work well. The lights were literally all on or all off, no in between which is difficult if one is sharing a room. The TV on demand channels did not work at all. The housekeeping staff were great. The concierge (male) was unhelpful. The doorman tried to strongarm me into taking a limousine when I had specifically requested a yellow cab and one was sitting right there - seriously, if I had not dug my heels in I would have paid twenty dollars more for the same ride with someone whose \"marketing\" was dubious at best. I felt that was a violation of the hotel's duty to provide a range of options that I was being steered so hard into a choice I had no intention of making. I had a friend come in from out of town and just told her to stay elsewhere. I even went down and asked to pay for a better room, but there were none to be had. No regency club rooms, no suites, nada. I think Hyatt should rethink this - I was just online thinking to book a room (at full price) at the Hyatt in Waikiki and there are no suites and the pool is closed due to renovation. I get that renovations need to be done, but save a few good rooms for your loyal customers, please! I am going somewhere else, kissing those points for the dollars spent goodby. It was that bad. I just don't want to repeat that. I should say I stayed at the Disneyland Hyatt when it was under renovations - they gave me a fantastic room and treated me beautifully, so it is not just that I am a prima donna who can't walk through a construction zone. Really, the management at this hotel needs to figure the staffing out for those behind the desks that we look to for help - the housekeepers, room service, etc. couldn't have been nicer but the chill on some of the the desk staff was difficult to shrug off.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWouldn't stay here EVER AGAIN!!\u201d", "Author": "redneckromeo", "ReviewID": "UR114973606", "Content": "The hotel is under renovation's.

You could also control the lighting settings aorund the room there as well...VERY cool. Nice LCD TV, couch, desk. The decorating was very contemporary. The standup shower was a really nice size...the sink space was a little smaller but probably normal NYC size. Maid service was very prompt and thorough.

The smoke detector was falling on the wall, the electronic panel at the back of the TV was out of the place. The room was increditily small with a dusty air vent behind the bed side lamp which is hardly to find the switch of it.

At the main entrance, I realized that I didn't have match for my cigarrette. So I asked the doorman for it, interesting thing is the doorman asked me for a spare cigarrete as a give back.

The bedroom was simple, but very clean, with very good quality bedding.

There was a newly opened 24 hour cafe in the lobby, which did the best coffee (well it should, being New York!) and the staff there were very friendly.

I was apparently lucky enough to have a refurbished king bedroom, but I thought it was the older model because the wallpaper was already peeling off and the ipod dock was broken. There was no coffee or complimentary bottles of water in the room. Another reviewer wrote not to forget to ask for complimentary coffee and water from the cafe in the lobby...but I never knew to ask in the first place, so I paid for mine. The main issue we experienced was that there were hundreds of teenagers staying at the hotel for the duration of our 4 nights in NYC. They were running up and down the halls, yelling to each other, and slamming the doors from 10 pm - 4 am. The last night of our stay, patience gone, we called guest services to explain the situation and asked for someone to address the other guests. A manager came up to speak with the teens, but never followed up to make sure that they stayed quiet (they did NOT), nor did anyone follow up with us to check on the status of the issue or appologize. If I were managing the hotel, I would have made sure to monitor the noise level at night on each floor. I mean, there were hundreds of teens staying at the hotel, sharing rooms! It would have only taken quick walk-throughs every so often to make sure things weren't out of control while the teens were in lodging. Instead, I paid over $1200 to stay at a hotel between business meetings...and felt like I was staying in a dorm room or hostile. The food at the hotel was also ridiculously expensive. If anyone has ever been to Seoul, I can only equate their food prices to there...which is the most expensive city (food-wise) that I've been to. If you eat at the hotel, you'll pay at least 2x, if not 3x what you'll pay on average in Manhattan. TIme for the positives! The bed was soft and comfortable. I was able to turn the lights off from bed...but only one of the 3 buttons worked. The shower head was large and the water pressure was good. The absolute best part was the location.

Reception was efficient, and we were offered on of the newly renovated rooms with a king. It was adequately spacious and the bed was very comfortable. I had stayed for a few nights two months previously and found the same comfort level with the bed. Room lights are controlled by several touch switched and these worked rather will. It is nice to be able to kill the lights from the bed. We did have trouble with the bathroom light on our third day - we could not get it to go on no matter which switch combination was chosen. The shower head is a large (about 8 inches by 8 inches) with a lot of holes and it send you a nice blanket of water streams. Elevators are fast and there are two banks that overlap on the 24th floor. We never waited longer than a couple of minutes. We used two meeting rooms and found them to have very good climate control, good comfortable chairs and nice lighting. What they do not have is WiFi (apparently this can be had for an absurd fee), and the cell service (at least in the room we had) is marginal at best. Hotels will likely add free WiFi in the future as more and more people demand it and are unwilling to pay a lot extra for it. The food we had ordered for breakfasts and lunches was quite good, actually unusually good for a hotel. There is a restaurant adjacent to the lobby for breakfast and two days I ate there. The service is not fast, but adequate. The prices here are over the top and many folks no doubt hit the street and find something a lot cheaper. We had two eggs, with toast and a small side, juice and coffee and the price was something like $46. Welcome to New York. But, that said, an extra glass of juice (very good) was offered, and the coffee kept coming. And, instead of what is effectively hash browns, I was allowed to substitute. I substituted roasted mushrooms, which were plentiful and simply superb. A very fine and wonderful strawberry jam (no seeds) is served for the toast. The same area is open for drinks and the wines by the glass that we had before heading out to dinner represent a good selection.

The decor was fresh and vibrant with some attractive modern furniture and a very large comfortable bed. We had no complaints about the size of the room whatsoever, infact we found it to be quite spacious overall. The room offered some nice faciltiies such as a fridge and a good quality iPod/iPhone dock. We had no problems with the functioning or performance of the air conditioning and the room had an opening window. We had no issues with noise either outside or inside the hotel. With the window closed, other than the occasional siren, noise levels were completely acceptable given this hotel is in the middle of New York city and throughout our 8 nights, we slept soundly! We did encounter one or two dusty surfaces (shelves above the suitcase storage area) and my wife would have liked an additional mirror somewhere in the room where it's easier to use the hairdryer and apply make-up. We loved the Marketplace shop in the foyer, this was so useful and quite well priced. We used it a few times to grab a quick breakfast before heading out sightseeing.

We ate breakfast in the restaurant on our first morning where we had great service and wonderful eggs benedict! We also frequented the bar one or two times which was very nice with great views along 42nd Street.

First time was in year 2000. I was too young and to naive to complain about anything. Since I'm neither now, it's time to review. Likes: - Location location location: right next to Grand central Station. Very convenient. - While I normally am not a fan of Hotel bar, we ended up checking out the Hotel bar here after a flight from hell we encountered earlier. Amazing desserts!!!! Pricey, but what hotel is not charging you premium prices? - We got the newly redesigned room on the upper floor. The room, while tiny (typical NYC hotel size) is pretty. Normally not a huge fan of red walls, but it works quite nicely here. - A nice \"welcome\" drinks and fruits delivered to our room was a nice touch. Not sure if they do this for everyone, but I'm a Hyatt member, so perhaps that had something to do with it. - Comfy beds! Had a hard time dragging cousin out of bed in the morning. - Walk-in closet. Seriously! Not huge, but still, a walk-in closet in a tiny hotel room in NYC. Dislikes: - Construction construction construction. We didn't know about this when we made RSVP. Funny, we called in our RSVP. You would think they would inform us about this fact. They start so early and they end so late (or did they even end at all since I heard them in the middle of the night too?). Our room is on Floor 23, and we could hear the drilling. Is that even possible? Not to mention the dust.. gross! dust everywhere... - Our room was really really dusty. We were there for 5 nights and it got worse everyday. They came and cleaned our room but why didn't they dust it? Gross.. - This one is weird, but I absolutely detested the toilet. It's one of those toilets that you normally see in public restroom. There's no way to flush the darn thing without closing the top off. They spent all the money redesigning the room and bathroom, which is nice and all, they skimped on the toilet? For reals? - I guess this really isn't the hotel's fault, but I'm going to mention this incident and probably add thin walls under my cons list too. We were the lucky people who ended up with a neighbor from hell. For the last 3 nights, we ended up having to share the floor and the walls obviously with some weird dude. First night, around 1 AM, we were awoken by screaming match between him and some girl. The second night, at 3 AM, we were awaken by a drunken outburst; from the peephole, we saw him being escorted to his room by security people. Seriously, how much did you have to drink to have to be escorted back to your room? It's not Vegas, people! Third night, it was raining, so we stayed in our room instead of roaming round the NY street. We heard noises right in front of our door. We peeped and guess what we saw, our wonderful neighbor was leaving his food tray in front of our door. Seriously dude? Why can't you just leave it in front of YOUR door? It's your trash. Okay, maybe I was just PMSing but I was really annoyed and waited till he went back to his room and pushed it back to his door. Cousin and the Mr. were worried I was going to get caught and start a major fight, but I can move like a ninja, so he didn't hear me :) - no free WiFi. Seriously, Hyatt, when are you going to stop being stingy and give us the free WiFi already? You're supposed to be a business hotel. It'd be nice to be able to do business while staying in your hotel without having to be penalized for it (aka having to pay for WiFi). Thank God for the Mr's Adroid phone, he is a Hot Spot lol.. we were able to use the internet without having to pay for it. Overall, it was an OK stay, but for the price, you could probably find a better hotel with a better service and hopefully better neighbors.

NY followed crazy 4 days in Vegas so we were looking for a little R&R and a chance to catch up with some friends in our fave city. Booked through Asda travel, around \u00a3150 per night in total which we thought was pretty reasonable for 3 people midweek. We were allocated a room on the 25th floor. First with the positives: - Room very clean - Considering this was a standard double, I actually thought the main room was not a bad size for NYC (remember we had 3 adult women sharing). We had enough space for three large suitcases on the floor without killing ourselves walking about the room. Bathroom small but perfectly formed. - Hotel in middle of refurb and we were on a brand new floor. I thought it looked great and lots of nice decorations in the hallway. This did lead to our only complaint though (see below). - The one complaint we did make (see below regarding the refurb noise), was dealt with superbly - immediate unqualified apology and $100 comp'd to our room to spend on dinner. Nice touch and although the issue we had was very annoying - it was enough to help us forget about it and get on with the holiday. - Hotel is in a really great location. 10min walk to Times Square, right next door to Grand Central, and fab delhis on Lex. Really couldn't hear much noise from outside. - 5 Mins tops to check in and out and only a short wait to leave our luggage with the bell desk on our last day ($2 per bag charge) - Liked the buzzy feel in the very grand lobby - makes you feel like you're really in the thick of it which I think people look for in NYC. - Fab service in the restuarant at dinner - very attentive red head who was charming and provided fautless service - Nice view from 25th floor Now with the not so good: - Only one restaurant in the hotel and the food was VERY rich (a little too much for our pallette). I'm sure when I stayed here before there was more choice and a cocktail bar ? - Mattresses were so soft that two of us had bad backs in the morning. Our other friend who is the only one to sleep on her side had no problem. Guess bed firmness a very personal preference and dependent on the way you sleep! - Refurb work was being done on the 26th floor immediately above us. We were woken up on our first day at 7am and honestly thought someone was about to come through the floor. Sounded like very loud dragging sound and very noisy banging. It was continuous so we couldn't go back to sleep after 7am :-( Exactly the same on morning 2 and we'd had enough. I phoned the front desk and as I mentioned above - they offered what I considered fair compensation and if we insisted I think they would also have moved us. We said don't worry as we had to get up early on the last day anyway and were more than happy with the way they handled it. I really thought the service in the Grand Hyatt was great - I think that says so much more about a hotel than the official star rating.

Make sure you have your own corkscrew or bottle opener as there was none in the room and roomservice wanted $9 to deliver one for you to borrow. If you need anything else then the Grand Central food market is good and very close. Renovated rooms were quite nice, baisc rooms are decent but on the small side, also very small bathrooms. As the renovations are recent they seem to have forgot a few things, such as plugging the mini-bar fridge in and stocking it with booze etc. Slightly odd!! Generally all the staff were very polite and professional, with one exception. The doormen are idiots, they could not care about getting you a taxi!! They are more interested in getting their kickbacks from the towncar drivers who circle like vultures looking for an airport fare.

I called the front desk and they again nicely asked me if I wanted another room. I suggested, perhaps getting someone up to this room to clean the room. How many times was I going to have to go down to the front desk before they gave me a clean room? A housekeeping manager and housekeeper came to the room. After the housekeeping manager directed the housekeeper to clean everything I pointed out, she left. I tipped the housekeeper in the hopes that she might do a thorough job cleaning the room. When I returned to the room there were still some crumbs and the hair was still in the shower. To add insult to injury I awoke the next morning to not a drop of hot water at 5:30. I was hopeful when the water turned lukewarm, but then want back to cold a minute later.

Due to all the recent crazy snowfall we were so happy to be going as we really did doubt it! after a great flight with virgin atlantic we arrived at jfk, customs took about 30mins so that was good. The 20 minute trip from JFK to midtown Manhattan took 3 hours because the roads were so bad in Queens, NYC state, which we had to drive through to get to Manhattan. On arrival to our hotel we were greeted with a luxurious, well kept, enormous lobby. the decor was beautiful, huge vases of flowers everywhere and a cascading waterfall at the front rotating doors. The colour everywhere is gold. We were welcomed quickly by a friendly female receptionist, we told her we were on our honeymoon and she upgraded our room free of charge to a larger newly refurbished room on the 24th floor. The hotel is undergoing renovation at the moment and Virgin let us know this about 6 months ago, but during our whole week there we did not see one work man or hear any noise at all, you would never know it was there. The main hotel restaurant was closed for refurbishing and there was a temporary one there instead, to be honest i didnt even notice as it was done so nicely. We did not have breakfast in the hotel as we chose to eat out but there is a very convienient 24hour store called Market in the lobby which sells wine, beer, soft drinks, hot meals, breakfast, chocolate, crisps, cookies, icecream whatever you want and it didnt cost any more than the news agent in Grand cenral terminal nexct door Hudson News. Rooms gorgeous modern and new, nice shower and bathroom, king size bed awesome heaven to sleep in. large LG tv in room with about 50 channels, nice desk and walled in closet. Lifts were fast and well kept. Overall I would 100% go back to this hotel or any other Hyatt hotel.The hotel is sandwiched between grand central terminal and the chrysler building, it takes 10mins to walk to Times Square, 5 mins to walk to New York Public Library, 10 mins to Empire State. The subway is quick and easy to use and is good when going downtown to ground zero, statue of liberty and to the brooklyn bridge. Grand central terminal is awesome for food and breakfast in particular. There is a large cafe opposite the hotel called Pershing Square breakfast here is awesome, quite expensive but worth it. Overall NYC is expensive at this time due to the economic climate but it is still more reasonable than UK, as you get a lot more for your money. Going off the beaten track is defo the way for cheaper meals. PIzza by the slice in NYC is awesome, better than Italy dare I say it!! Ate once in TGI Fridays as we left it till 10.30pm to eat as decided to go to Rockafeller center top of the rockl after the xmas show at Radio City, it was probably the most expensive meal we had as chains in the USA are as overpriced as they are in the UK but my NY steak was awesome, cooked perfectly. If you want to see a Broadway show be prepared to wait a few days before you will get in and be prepared to pay a lot. We saw Wicked which was amazing, tickets cost us $114 each which is about \u00a380 each so quite similar to west end prices, maybe even a little more.

We'd stayed with a Hyatt before in Maui so having had a good experience last time, and seeing a competitive price, we went for it this time. Upon arrival, we checked in instantaneously and were told that because we were staying for a while, they would upgrade us for free, from a Double to what I'm guessing was a Deluxe King - a huge bed, very spacious, sofa, desk, etc. And to top it off, right outside our window was the Chrysler building - couldn't have asked for better. As with the other Hyatt we stayed in, the room was nicely decorated, helpfully had some iPod speakers next to the bed and was generally very comfortable. And after a long day of sightseeing / shopping, it was just perfect to return to it. The only noise we heard, apart from the traffic which wasn't a problem, was a noisy neighbour. Down at reception, some renovation work was underway but disruption was kept to a minimum and it didn't distract from the attractive lobby, filled with Xmas trees. Location wise, you can't go too wrong with here. You have the Grand Central Station subway virtually below the hotel, that can take you anywhere you need and back again. On foot, you are 10-15 minutes south of the Rockefeller Center, 10-15 minutes north of the Empire State and 10-15 minutes east of Times Square.

Summary - location great, however, can't figure out how this is a 4 star hotel. Even some 2 star hotels are better equipped to accomodate travellers. Read later on that the renovated rooms are great - however, when a traveller is making reservation in a 4 star hotel, every room should be fantastic, renovated or not.

This year, we stayed in two rooms on the newly renovated 24th floor from 12/15 - 12/19. I was very impressed with nearly every aspect of the Hotel and the renovated rooms. Upon check-in, we were greeted by the very pleasant and helpful Amanda who granted our request for two rooms next to each other, both with two double beds. The upgrade to the renovated floor was a nice surprise, and Amanda even gave our three girls their own Hyatt teddy bears. What a great welcome! As others have stated, the lobby is very large and beautiful. There is always a lot of activity there, and music booming in the bar area gives it the feel of a trendy NYC club. But the noise disappears when you step into the elevators--and there are a ton of elevators. We never waited more than 15 seconds for an elevator, and they move very quickly. Not even time to enjoy the television inside the elevator before arriving at our floor. The corridors and rooms on the 24th floor have a very chic, modern feel. The color scheme is sophisticated yet comforting. Rooms are very roomy by NYC standards. A few touches I enjoyed in the room included the iPod docking station/radio/alarm, flat-screen TV, the safe lighted from the inside with room for my laptop, the big \"rainfall\" shower head, chaise sofa, modern light fixtures and light switches, and nice size walk-in closet. Beds were plush, the room temperature always comfortable, and the bathroom amenities were upscale. Our window looked out over Grand Central Station, and we never heard any street noise. Hot water was plentiful--never an issue. Plenty of towels for the entire family. And no evidence of any bedbugs in either room after four nights. The tub was missing a stopper. We stuffed a wash cloth in the drain to hold water for baths. Housekeeping did a nice job cleaning the room but was inconsistent in leaving clean wash cloths and drinking glasses. And, as others have pointed out, a coffee maker would have been nice. My only other concern is the security of this hotel. There is nothing to prevent someone from coming in off the street and going up the elevators to the guest floors. I would recommend adding room card access to the elevators. Hotel personnel were usually standing by the elevator bank, but I never saw them question anyone. We had no problems, but I did see one person who didn't appear to be a guest go up and then quickly back down one day. I couldn't help but sense he was making some sort of delivery (hopefully a legal one). I could be wrong about him, but there is nothing to prevent this. The Grand Hyatt is a straight shot across 42nd street to Times Square--a 10-12 minute walk. Rockefeller Center and St. Patrick's Cathedral area is an easy 12-15 minute walk up Fifth Avenue. The New York Public Library and Bryant Park--where we love to ice skate, is a very short walk, and the Empire State Building is not far from there. Not to mention everything is easily accessible from Grand Central Station, where we also enjoyed cheesecake from Junior's every night. Tip: the iPhone GPS makes using the subway SUPER easy. It will tell you which train to get on and how many minutes until departure and arrival. Overall, I give the Grand Hyatt very high marks for location, comfort, and value. The staff was very friendly, though not intrusively so. My wife and I agree that we would stay at the Grand Hyatt again on our next visit to New York City.", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Espoo, Finland", "Title": "\u201cBook double!\u201d", "Author": "HraPormestari", "ReviewID": "UR90728766", "Content": "We stayed a few nights in the Grand Hyatt with our friends in December. On arriving to the hotel our friends were given a double room and we got a king room. After taking our luggage to the room we went to see our friends' room - and were astonished. Their room was almost twice as big as ours, and they had a nice view to the city compared to our view, which was the opposite wall! We went immediately to the reception to ask for a double room, and were lucky enough to get one. Especially if you pay the full price (which isn't advisable, by the way - use Priceline instead), don't be satisfied with a king room, when you could get a much bigger one for the same amount of money. In addition, the king rooms don't have a bath, only a shower. Due to a high floor, our room didn't have any kind of problem with the noise from the streets. The downsides of staying in a high floor are the elevators. There aren't enough of them for a hotel this size. Almost every time we had to wait for one, and on the way down they kept just stopping and stopping until they were crammed. Besides, our room was facing the elevators, and the noise woke us several times during the night. The hotel lobby is very grandiose, but otherwise the hotel and the rooms are more low-keyed and stylish. There is a indoor connection to Grand Central Terminal, which is very convenient: you get to the subway station in a couple of minutes. Naturally the location of the hotel is very good, but since there are so many interesting places to see in New York, you won't manage without a Metrocard - at least we didn't. Grand Hyatt is a relatively good hotel, but there are a few deficiencies, which a hotel of this standard shouldn't have. Firstly, there aren't coffee makers in the rooms. That might sound like a small failing, but we believe, that it's the small things that make the stay enjoyable. Secondly, Grand Hyatt charges extra for everything. In hotel lobbies the wireless internet connection should be free, but not in Grand Hyatt. Also the luggage storage sets you down a couple of dollars. Again, those are small amounts of money, but we think that these kind of things show, how much the hotel values their guests. Especially if the hotel is as expensive as Grand Hyatt, there should be some extra perks to cheer guests up. Thirdly, the young concierge clearly wasn't equal to his duties. He gave us inaccurate information of the airport transportation. He didn't know that the hotel had its own cars for the journey, and besides, he gave us a truly flawed estimate of the price of the cab ride. The hotel's transportation costs about $80, and is a good option, especially if you are travelling in a group and have lots of luggage.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carlisle, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location Great Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ShirleyRuth43", "ReviewID": "UR90249085", "Content": "My Sister and I stayed at this Hotel for her 40th Birthday, We e/mailed ahead to check if they had our booking and when we arrived thay had put 50 dollers on our room to spend in the hotel Ruth also got a birthday card and some Chocolatesdelivered to our room on the first night.

We visited The Market several times each day - very nice addition since our last stay. We didn't use room service. We did't miss a coffee maker or mini-bar in our room. There were some renovations taking place, but nothing to disturb our stay. It has to be the perfect location within the city - central location next to Grand Central provides easy access to everything! The staff - front desk, concierge, management, and houskeeping - was top notch. Honestly, everyone we dealt with had a smile and a kind wordl! It's expensive, but a real value by NYC standards. We'll be back...", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cOK For One Night, But Disappointing Considering the Cost\u201d", "Author": "sherful2008", "ReviewID": "UR87339033", "Content": "I have to agree with the recent negative reviews on this hotel. First off, I want to make clear that it's not that the hotel's quality is terrible, it's more so that the PRICE and star rating considering the quality is terribly deceptive and way off. This is considered (I guess) a four star, and runs over $400/night, and I would say it is really only worth $150/night. Secondly, the staff was really helpful in dealing with my problems. That said, if you really need and value a genuinely clean and modern establishment, these rooms might not be for you. Then again, it's a huge hotel with over 30 floors and I can't let my experience speak for all the rooms. The lobby looks like a palace, but the rooms were another story. When I checked in, the concierge was very polite and I happily went up to my room, only to wonder why the toilet seat was closed (they are typically open in a cleaned hotel room). I open it to find a huge amount of fecal matter and dark urine. I even decide I'll flush it and stay, but when I do that, it doesn't all go down and at this point I'd need tools to clean the toilet. So, I went downstairs and the next staff person quickly provided me with a new room. This second room was also not clean. The toilet seat was down, but I was in no mood for anymore surprises, so I left that alone, but noticed that the linens were out of wack, soap had been opened with the wrapper left on the sink, and the cabinet door underneath the tv was open. A pillow was misplaced on the other bed (it looked like someone was laying on it, not like the cleaning crew accidentally placed it on the other bed) and the vertical throws at the bottom of the bed was missing from one double bed and placed messily on the other. I could tell this had not been fully tended to and went downstairs for a second time. The woman I got was really apologetic and put me in my third room. She apologized and gave me a coupon for free breakfast and beverages from the hotel's Market. I checked in the third room which seemed OK (it was cleaned by staff). I went to the gym and when I returned, there were complimentary (and yummy) chocolate chip cookies, a bottle of champagne, and a card with a lollipop that apologized again for my situation. I really appreciated the attention and it helped make a frustrating night better. As for the room, I was surprised at how aged it looked (I know it's a historic building, but judging from the lobby and prices and reputation of the chain, I'd expected pretty on-point renovations). The carpet is sort of dusty looking and you can tell it's pretty old and kinda lumpy looking in spots, the bathroom is super small, and the doors (bathroom and closet) are old fashioned with a few small chunks of wood missing and paint chipped. I've stayed in much better non-chain, cheaper hotels that have been beautiful, overseas and domestically. There was no fridge, so I had to throw my leftover Chipotle away. There was no coffee machine either. I called the front desk to see if there was a fridge in the building for occupants' use, and was told that I could \"rent\" one for $20.00. No thanks. In the trash the burrito goes. I didn't take a shower because the shower floor looked a little dirty (not terribly, but I didn't feel good about going in there) and the drain was rusted. There was a piece of trash on the floor under one of the beds, so the floor hadn't been thoroughly vacuumed. My total was over $450 and this was under a reduced conference rate. I slept with the lights (and in turn, tossed and turned every other hour) on because I would bet bed bugs are in there and they tend to really come out in the dark. I expected free wifi, but the wifi browser was prompting me to pay. I could deal with it for one night on a business trip, but if I'd have booked this hotel for a week for vacation with friends, I would have been highly pissed and frustrated. This hotel should make more investment in the infrastructure of the rooms. I was on the 17th, 24th, and 29th floor and can only base this on my 3 experiences. Location and views are great, and if you are easy-going hotel wise and aren't going to spend much time in the room, it's probably fine for you. But, I'm sure there's better for less out there, nearby.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing hotel but good location.\u201d", "Author": "Expat_wife", "ReviewID": "UR86774837", "Content": "Since we were only going to be NYC for a few days, we chose the Hyatt because of its central location and because the Hyatt is a reliable brand. We have stayed at beautiful Grand Hyatts around the world and were sure this would be the same. However, we had a unexpectedly mixed experience at this property. On our last day, our maid told us that the entire hotel was undergoing renovation and that our floor would be next. She said that we should come back next year to see a brand-new beautiful hotel. I wondered why it took a maid to communicate this bit of advice, why wasn't this information on the hotel website or elsewhere??? The positives: 1) Great location. Attached to Grand Central Station -- transportation around the city couldn't be easier. Plus being in mid-town means you can walk almost anywhere. 2) Good fitness room on the top floor. 3) We got good rates for our rooms. Now, the negatives: 1. The rooms (we had 2 rooms) were as ordinary as could be. The bedrooms are small and plain, the bathrooms were plain 3-star hotel style with a shower/tub combo, shower curtain and tiny sink. One sink was partially blocked and did not drain well. The door is not sound-proofed so we could hear anyone talking in the hallway. The amenities in the bathroom were not replenished after the first day. We had to call for more shampoo. There is a sign that you can request turn-down service, which defeats the luxury of coming back to your room and finding it all prepared for evening. 2. There was no refrigerator in the room. Not having a minibar probably saved us a lot of money, but I was hoping to store some snacks in a refrigerator. 3. The breakfast buffet costs $30 a person and we were required to pay BEFORE being allowed into the room to see the buffet. It was quite odd and the hostesses (there were 3) acted like they were blocking the door. Once we went inside, we could see why. It was a disappointing display of stale pancakes, a few half-empy bowls of fruit, some yogurt and pre-cooked eggs that were slightly grey on the edges. Again, we've eaten like kings at some Hyatt buffets but not this time. It was very disappointing. Luckily, there is a market in the lobby that sells fruit, yogurt, baked goods and granola that we took up to our rooms on the following days for a much better breakfast. 4) The water to both bathrooms was turned off when we woke up on Sunday morning. That was a shocker. Luckily the water came back on fairly soon, but with a nasty brown blast. The water wasn't clear until a few hours later. No apologies or explanations from the front desk. Early sightseeing was out as we couldn't take our showers as early as we would have liked. 5) In all of our dealings with the front desk, service was brusque. A couple of times, no one picked up the phone when I called from the room. I know this is New York, but really? The Hyatt needs to do some customer service training sessions. Overall, I was shocked that Hyatt is running a property so out-of-line with the rest of the brand. I am glad to hear it is undergoing a physical revamp, but it needs a lot of work in many areas before it is up to standards. If I didn't know it, I would have guessed this was a 3-star hotel. I think I would stay here again, if I heard that things were better. The location makes it a great place, and I recommend it because of that.", "Date": "November 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newark, Delaware", "Title": "\u201cGood stay, bad ending (Financially).\u201d", "Author": "ddash302", "ReviewID": "UR86767356", "Content": "Stayed at the Grand Central Hyatt on a guys weekend trip.

The room was a good size and very clean (and we had NO bites as one person mentions in earlier reviews there is nothing at this hotel as far as we are aware). The beds are very comfortable and good pillows too. The coffee shop was clean and really useful in the mornings for a coffee and breakfast croissant. We enjoyed drinks in the bar in the evenings even though they are undergoing refurbishment and there was only a limited selection available. All the staff we spoke to were helpful, polite and had good local knowledge. There are plenty of restaurants closeby and of course you can also get a cab outside if you wish. The hotel is on 42nd street, you can walk to anywhere from there, but it was also great to go next door to Grand Central station and hop on the Metro.

That said, the Grand Club had very skimpy offerings, service was slow (both check in and bell service), mis-information was given (2 different employees said both yes and no that the bar/lounge was open), and the rooms were tired.

It seemed as if my room was either HUMID and hot, or freezing! 2-the check in agents were taking customers out of the \"regular\" line (2 agents working that line) while Diamond members sat and waited in a line that was 4 deep (1 agent working Diamond line) for about 12 minutes.

On the negative side the bathroom was very small but it was well furnished. The other minor problem, but one that I often find with American hotels, is that there was no jug to make a hot drink and no fridge.

We(my and my 5yr. old son) met my husband who was in New York for work. PROS- Great location of Hotel, close to all Our room; we were upgraded (used a suite upgrade coupon) which was a very large room with sitting room. This was great so our son could sleep in a bit and we had 2 closets to store suitcases, etc.... The room was on the 18th floor, which is a bit misleading and is actually the 8th floor. ( I think they just want you to think you are on a higher floor than you actually are so they've added 10 floors to each level) Since we were on the 8th, our view was a large wall of the Grand Central Station and an office bldg. On the the 8th floor we were unlucky to hear the garbage truck come by a few times starting at 7am or so. (I've included a photo) Keep in mind, I'd rather have the larger room and deal with the not so great view and noise from the trash trucks, it is a city after all. The Doormen were very helpful, esp. the man who gave my son a huge lollypop everyday! It was always easy enough to get a cab with their help. BEST part of the hotel was the concierge (Chris) on the Club Floor. He went out of his way to make our trip the best it possibly could, he got us the most amazing tix to the Lion King, dinner reservations that were right on and he just had the best personality and I am sure represents everything Hyatt wants to represent in regards customer service. He even helped out with last minute passport problem we had! (same day passport was achieved) OK, the not so grand.... Design of the bathroom was in need of help. The sink was almost as small as a pedistal sink, there was no where to put any items. (though they did have a little shelf across the bathroom) I think they are updating/remodeling, if so I'm sure the bathrooms will be updated. We had a few problems with the room within the first few days: 1. the room was dark, (due to the view of a wall) and one of the large stand-up lamps was broken. I called to have an engineer come and fix, 4 hours later no one showed up. I had to call again and they lamp was broken, they did replace it. 2. 1/2 way though the trip the airconditioner went out (or would not turn on) in our main room with the bed. I also put a call in for that and never heard back. I didn't want to wait around for someone to fix it so I just let it go, it was not very hot anyway. 3. Our last night my son and I went to dinner (about 6pm) and asked the doorman for an umbrella (tons of rain), he said I need to go back up in the hotel registration and get one from the front desk for a deposit of $100. OK, that's fine..... I'm not going to steal the 4 foot bright orange Hyatt umbrella, but OK. Long story short no umbrellas! None, zip, nothing. Come on you should have more umbrelllas than you have rooms, it was not fun trying to walk down a city street with a toddler in the rain. The young man at the front desk (I'll withhold his name) was extremely rude....nice no umbrellas.

Breakfast was extra, and unusually expensive. The bed was, however, comfortable and clean - after a 16 hour direct flight that came as a real relief. Another unusual experience was that the hotel charged me $2 to hold baggage after check-out, which was politely explained by reception as a \"union issue\" (which the hotel ought to absorb, period) and the staff at the hotel gate seemed to expect a tip for merely hailing me a cab to the airport (not the most pleasant of goodbyes) !

We werent disappointed by the friendly reception staff who processed our reservation in seconds. We got a room on the 26th floor to the rear of the hotel. No view but you are compensated by some piece and quiet when you want it. The next building opposite is just as big but mainly offices so all quiet on weekends. The room was again beyond expectations. We where told NY rooms are small but this was a good size and more than adequate and certainly larger than some travellodge and more high end hotels Ive stayed in in London in my time. Bathroom/shower was the best ive seen, clean with no mould, wear, broken tiles etc etc. 42\" Flat screen TV, Queen size bed, Internet keyboard, Iron/board,hairdryer, radio, ipod connection all standard. We didnt eat at the restaurants as there are plenty cheap eateries in the vicinity. For a quality breakfast i recommend the cafe/restaurant below the overpass outside the hotel directly opposite Grand Central Station. 'Pershing Central ' I recall was the name. Bit pricey at $48 for two cooked breakfast, coffee and juice but you got to do it once. back to the hotel concierge very friendly and helpful. Use them to find the best deals. It has a PC and printer in the foyer to do your check in boarding pass for flying out which was easy to use and quick. Staff will ehlp if you cant use it. The 'Market' shop in the foyer sells quick snacks, coffee, drinks porradge, cereals etc to take away or eat in. We used it for a coffee,hot chocolate in evenings and breakfast on last day. Quality food !. Check out was 11.00am but they have a bell service desk allowing you to drop off your luggage for the day as our flight was at 10.00pm so we didnt want to carry it around all day. $2 charge per item but thats OK.

The hotel is by FAR the best value for the same standard around the city and the location (attached to Grand Central, five minute walk from Times Square and 5th Ave) is unbeatable. Rooms are lovely, modern, clean, big and comfy. The first time we stayed in December 2008, we got an upgrade to the second level. When we went thesecond time we just had a standard room and to be honest the money isn't really worth it. The room is probably 50% bigger which is a good amount but is not really needed, the standard room is PLENTY big enough. The bathrooms are bigger to but again, not necessary, plus our view from the upgrade was of the roof of the building next door. The view from the standard room was of 42nd Street (Quite an inspiring view). The hotel has a new cafe that was opened in between our two stays and this provides croissants, fruit, cakes, cereal, crisps, chocolate and all hot and cold drinks you could want. It isn't 'cheap' but it is handy and great value. Alternatively the Grand Central Food Court (In the basement from the main Concourse of GC) has loads of cafes and is really cheap and very nice. And of course there is a Starbucks on every corner if you like a name. The lobby of the hotel is very nice as well which is always nice. The hotel is very cheap no matter how you book. The first time we booked flights and hotel seperately and it was around \u00a3750 for seven days, however we didn't take into account the taxes so it ended up costing around \u00a3800-\u00a3850. The second time we booked through Thomas Cook and for five days it was \u00a3750 so just shop around at the time you are booking. Location wise, the Tube is fantastic. Even better than London's to us because Manhattan is one narrow island. The Green Line goes North to South and can take you between museums on the Upper East down to Wall Street and Brooklyn Bridge. and connections on the tube can get you anywhere and everywhere. In the City itself, you must go to Soho as it is so nice. The atmosphere is really alive (Although don't go early as everywhere is shut... 12pm onwards is when shops open) and at night it comes alive. Really recommend Lombardi's Pizza, you will NEVER eat a tastier pizza. It's near Soho, corner of Spring & Mott Street (Get the Number Six Tube to Spring Street and go east two blocks) Anyway, on the whole New York is the most amazing city we have ever been to, and the Grand Hyatt New York is the ideal place to explore the city from.

The inside of the hotel is very dark, but grand feeling and constantly bustling. Whilst I probably would consider staying here again as the rooms aren't hideously expensive, I was let down by a few things. Firstly the service; I thought America prided itself on great customer service, it really wasn't apparent at this hotel with most staff not conducting themselves in an overly helpful manner (the customer IS king, remember!) and actually I wouldn't say they were understaffed, especially in the bar. Some of the staff at breakfast were very miserable looking it has to be said! Secondly, the expense of everything else. The rooms are a reasonable price, but $70 for breakfast for 2, you have to be kidding! $16 for a small glass of wine of average quality? $4 to \"store\" your bags whilst waiting for a taxi back to the airport!? Needless to say we didn't eat or drink at the hotel apart from breakfast and next time, I'm sure within a short walk we could find breakfast for less. Thirdly, the worst part of our stay, interconnecting doors between rooms and the general corridor noise. This is NOT a quiet hotel at all, which is probably to be expected for one of this size, but the interconnecting doors were a nightmare. Our \"neighbours\" seemed to enjoyed some slapping and rough sex at some ridiculous hours of the night/morning and was very tiresome. Due to the poor customer service, I couldn't be bothered to go down and argue my point as to why I would like another room as I have a feeling it would have been met with the usual \"we can't do that\", which seemed to be a common theme from reception staff to bar staff.

I had a very positive experience at check in, with a clerk who actually took the time to care about my stay, gave me a few extra little perks and was generally helpful. Also, the people in the \"market\" store/cafe were very friendly and nice. Made an impression. The location is central--next to Grand Central. I had a deluxe king room, which was fairly roomy for NYC. The layout was a bit odd---sort of an L shape, with the tv as an artificial barrier between the entry and bed area--but it worked. Nice workspace. The negatives--the room was not very \"fresh.\" Yes, it had a 37 inch LCD TV, and the decor was fine. But the carpet needs to go. It smelled sort of like a wet dog. It was purely a product of it being too old. Otherwise, the room was fine. The bathroom was very small--that didn't bother me much. The lobby was an happening place--for better or for worse. Its starting to look a little dated, also, I think--there's this waterfall type of thing which is fine, but its kind of got that glitzy Vegas in the 80s feel to it. The bed was nothing special. Not especially comfortable. For a NY room, though, it was quiet. Street noise was minimal, and interior nice was nonexistant which was a very pleasant surprise. I know this has been a problem at this hotel. At my request, I was given a room without a connecting door and I think that makes a difference. I'm picky but I didn't hear a thing. Overall, if the price is right, and you are looking for a \"nice\" hotel in New York--go for it.

Right next to Grand Central Terminal, and within walking distance of pretty much anything you might want to see. Of course, if you need to take the Subway, then it's right next door.

The kids were fussing at one point, in the check-in line, and the desk staff gave them chocolate Turtles. My only two complaints were - First: that there was not a coffee pot in the room and there was a charge for coffee in the lobby cafe. We did receive two free coffee vouchers upon check-in, but of course, you need them daily, if you are a coffee drinker. Second: the bathroom was so small that you can actually hit your elbow on the sink countertop, which is also very small, no counter space, while trying to unroll the toilet paper.

First off, I think what you are really paying for is location, which is great--right next to Grand Central and within walking distance of a lot of NYC attractions. Also good was the lovely lobby, which has a little shop that sells yummy sandwhiches, drinks etc. However, there were a few negatives as well. There was a mix-up with our reservations-we had a number of rooms which we booked online to be on the same floor, so the whole family could be in the same part of the hotel. Ahead of time we were told this would be no problem. When we arrived we found this was not the case. This to me wasn't that big a deal, but what was a real hassle was the front desk staff, who tried to switch things, then couldn't, then said they could, then gave away some of our rooms by mistake, then tried to fix that, all while giving us the run around. It took much longer than necessary to sort out (hours), and I could tell the staff really didn't care one way or the other about fixing things. So if you are looking for great service don't come here. Also the many reviewers who said the rooms need updating are correct. I was surprised, after seeing how lovely the lobby was, that the rooms were really just average, outdated, and a bit on the small side (bathroom was tiny). However, we didn't spend that much time in the room anyway, so if you are looking for a simple base of operations, it serves its purpose. Did have some street noise and noise from other guests walking down hallways, etc. while trying to sleep, so I'd say it needs some soundproofing too. Also made the mistake of going to the bar one night and two drinks cost $30, which I thought was ridiculous, even by NYC standards. Overall I'd say the experience was average--not great and not terrible. It's up to you if you think the great location balances out paying a bit too much for a really average room and no-frills service.", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stansted Mountfitchet, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExpected better\u201d", "Author": "crdanuk", "ReviewID": "UR70015294", "Content": "Having stayed at the Sofitel my previous time in NYC, I was expecting considerably more from the Hyatt.

Certainly when compared with the grandeur of the lobby, the rooms are a let down. The concierge was also not as useful as the Sofitel. Given there are so many places to eat in NYC, a bit of advice is helpful - the guys at the Sofitel seemed to really listen to what you were saying and help you choose exactly the kind of place you were looking for; here, it felt like the concierge were just working off a list - you want steak, go here; you want fish, go here. No consideration of price/location etc. Again, I expected more. Location is excellent though - about a 10 minute walk from Time Square, and being right near Grand Central station means getting about is really easy.

Our key card refused to work despite having it fixed twice. The snacks in the lounge are not good at all. This is the first time we have seen that you have to pay for alcohol in the lounge. The front desk told us that breakfast was till 11 and when we stopped by at 10:20 nothing was available anymore. The service is incredibly rude.

The hotel is overall one of the better places to stay in NYC, but has a few problems that I wish they'd address. One was the check-in duration. At other Hyatts, I am used to being at the desk just a few minutes. Here everything was in slow motion, including a problem with the reservation that inadvertently dropped the last night of our stay. It was eventually fixed, but only after about 20 minutes or more, including a trip to the back office to consult with a manager. Upon return, the receptionist mumbled something about a \"new computer system\". A second problem was the internet service, which was terrible. I am running a corporate laptop with Windows XP, and was losing the service every 5-10 minutes despite \"excellent signal strength\" on the wireless. I called the T-Mobile support number and was told that they have a known problem with XP, and that I should get some kind of adjunct wireless device from the front desk. I didn\u2019t bother, since I was using it only a little while each AM before going out to sightsee, but if I had been on a business trip, and needed to get work done, I would have been furious. Since I have no problem with the same computer elsewhere in the country when I travel, I can only conclude that it\u2019s their ISP or server set-up. According to Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems, 50 % or more of the computers connecting to the internet are running XP, so they shouldn\u2019t be having these kinds of problems. Lastly were the elevators. They had an event Saturday evening which had a large grpoup tranisiting from the lobby to the ballroom floor. They had reserved an elevator with a operator for the event. This in itself was fine, except that the other elevators weren\u2019t all operating. That same elevator was the only one returning to the lobby level, but regular hotel guests couldn\u2019t use it. A long line of hotel guests trying to get to their rooms formed, and only after a minor rebellion did we get to board the elevator. It seemed at other times also that only one or two elevators were responding, which kept them unnecessarily crowded on every trip.

I\u2019ve stayed here several times ~ alone on business, with colleagues for a conference, and most recently, together with my family ~ four stays in the last couple of years. What makes a great hotel? I would say consistency of excellence. For us, this hotel has never failed to disappoint. The staff are absolutely first-class. At check-in, you always see a line of smiling Hyatt check-in agents. Yes, sometimes, at busy times you might have to wait. But when it\u2019s your turn, you aren\u2019t rushed. The staff gives everyone the time they need to ask questions, they explain about the hotel\u2019s amenities, and they are unfailingly cheerful and polite. They help with finding you the right room, discussing with you what\u2019s more likely to be quiet, or to have a little extra space. As a tripadvisor member wrote when s/he checked in early, the front desk agent told her they love early check-ins because it gives them more time to get to know you. How many times have you been told this when you\u2019ve checked in early? And they absolutely mean it. In the executive club lounge, if you are lucky enough to be on that floor or have access through your status, again, you encounter first class staff who do everything they can to give you a great (relaxing) experience during the daytime, and to speed things along so everyone gets a great breakfast in the morning. The food and snacks in the lounge have always been very high quality as well \u2013 gourmet deserts you\u2019d pay a fortune for if you were outside the hotel, for example. Every room I have had has been spotless, the amenities reflect Hyatt\u2019s high standards, and whenever I see housekeeping staff they invite me to have a nice day. I haven\u2019t had service like this, first rate on every level, at any hotel, and over the last few years I've been Diamond with Hilton as well as Hyatt, and stayed in big cities all over North America and Europe (although I haven\u2019t traveled much in Asia where I hear the hotels are also a cut above). As a final word, for a recent visit, I mentioned to the manager (Mike), that it was my mother\u2019s 70th birthday and I was a repeat guest. From that point onwards, nothing was too much trouble, from allocating us the perfect room, to treats and amenities, and a genuine concern to make sure that my mother had a great trip and we were all really well taken care of to the best of their (considerable) abilities. For example, at check-in, the front desk agent (Diane) showered us with kindnesses, from fruit & wine for my mother, to t-shirts and cookies for my daughter, as well as coupons to try out their excellent new Marketplace in their lobby (a great addition which has high quality ready prepared food and snacks you can grab and go, in other words, bye bye expensive room service - why don't more hotels do this?) And did I mention the location? You can\u2019t finish a review of this hotel without saying that it is superb- well, you can see that throughout the reviews \u2013 what I wanted to add was that in NYC, famous for its brusque service, this hotel is an oasis of professionalism and warmth.

I would probably rate the experience a 3.5 star, but I will admit I am pretty picky. I will share the good and the bad for us. The Good: #1 - Location, location, location!!! Just very central to everything. We walked to the theater, walked a lot on 5th Avenue, walked to Central Park, walked to the Empire State... You get the point. You can not beat the location. Subway is directly underneath the hotel which quickly takes you up and down Manhattan to anywhere you want to go. What else: The lobby is very nice and spacious. The air conditioning is very pleasant (it was hot in NYC). The staff is professional and courteous. The bed was very comfortable. And did I mention location? There are a lot of options to eat nearby. So for breakfast we would just find a local place and at. Grand Central Market, which is very nice, is right there! The Not so Good: Our main complaint is around the room itself, which was \"average\" to say the best. - The hotel is pretty worn. Our room looked dated. - Bathroom was very small and had a lot of wear on it. It needs some serious updating. - Bathroom had no tub, and we were in an apartment suite! - The hotel does not get much natural light, so the rooms tend to be a bit dark. - A lot of hallway noise at all times. The other problem we had was getting good advice from the concierge. They were very nice and polite, but the advice they give is very generic and super-conservative. For example they told us to plan for a one hour ride to La Guardia and to be there two hours before due to security. We did that. It took us 15 minutes to get to LaGuardia (it was a Sunday) and there was nobody in the security line. So we waited at the airport for over 2.5 hours. The hotel prices for food are insane. $9 for drip coffee!!!! But this was easy to solve as you just walk half a block and there are options everywhere. Overall it was fine and the location was great.

Well, it was all right -- our room on the 23rd floor was quiet, super clean and very comfortable King bed etc. -- it was a fine business hotel but not a luxury one (I measure that by the impersonal attitude of the staff-- efficient but nothing extra -- and the fact that the fitness room while well equipped had no sauna or steamroom or changing rooms, let alone a swimming pool, and there were none of the amenities such as bathrobes in the rooms or minibars that you'd expect in a first rank hotel. The room price was not exorbitant for Manhatten ($300) but still a little high, but then you are paying for the brand and the location.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cBest location\u201d", "Author": "shubz81", "ReviewID": "UR62044347", "Content": "It is awsome place in new york ....... located well center. you will get best rates aswell if you book in advance", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "greece", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "leonGreece", "ReviewID": "UR61881662", "Content": "Very good price,very nice service and the best location in NY for tourists.", "Date": "April 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "VA", "Title": "\u201cGood and clean but a bit loud.\u201d", "Author": "prldecivic", "ReviewID": "UR61786898", "Content": "Pros: Clean, location is great, employees were very nice, comfy bed, nice lobby, near subway, taxis available in front, Cons: No fridge, bathroom is pretty small, Noise through connecting doors. If you are a light sleeper you may have problems sleeping at night due to the connecting room doors, most of the rooms have connecting doors and the noise from the room next door can be heard very loud through the door. The first night was perfect, the room next to us was empty, the following night we could hear a couple laughing and talking next door until about midnight, the 3rd night we could hear a couple making \"love\" (yes you could hear all the moans and noises) for about 45mins until close to 1am. Very uncomfortable, imagine if we had kids with us? It was a good stay minus our loud neighbors. I believe if the hotel would just get rid of the connecting doors the rooms would be a lot quieter. If you are a light sleeper make sure you ask for a high room, we were on the 28th floor and could still hear the sirens through the night slightly, i can only imagine how loud they were on the lower lvls. I'd like to point out that the concierge desk had very helpful and nice people, the front desk staff was very polite and the housekeeping staff was very thoughtful, first day we had the TV on and the housekeeping staff didnt even bother to knock, they just skipped our door as we could hear them knock on the neighbors doors. The next day they knocked very lightly saying housekeeping in a low voice and i said busy and they moved along. So many housekeeping staff in other hotels knock very loud, banging on the door yelling HOUSEKEEPING and you can hear them all the way down the halls. The rooms were clean, but you can tell its an older hotel. They are starting to look worn down and will need to be renovated soon. The room did have a LCD tv though which was good since i had seen some pics with tube tvs. Location was great, couple blocks from 5th ave. for shopping, about a 20min walk up 5th ave to central park, times square isnt to far either. Central station is right next door. Overall it was a good stay, we booked through priceline so our room cost half the price of a normal $399/night price. So was great value for us.

The 2nd room was smelly and dark with black stains on the bed sheets. The bathrooms inboth rooms smelt of mold and the shower floor was that crusty it had gone yellow. There was no extractor fan or ventilation In the bathrooms so when hot water was used the steam was a nightmare. We complained right away and was given a look of different rooms which were slot worse than ours. The hotel then offered to deep clean our rooms and they gave us breakfast as means of an appoligy. ( breakfast for 4 people would cost $160 without tip. The service is that bad they don't diserve a tip) also after the deep clean the rooms did not appear any cleaner! Also on 9 separate occasions we had to return to the loby to get our keycards reactivated. Not a huge problem I know but when there is only 2 memberes of staff at the desk and a line of people almost out the door it gets a bit annoying.

We had 1.5 days to explore NYC, and this was a great home base location, right next door to Grand Central Terminal, and a 10 min walk from Times Square. The Airport Express shuttle bus leaves you practically at the Grand Hyatt's doorstep, and that in itself is a tremendous asset. The outside of the hotel is gorgeous silver mirror glass, and the hotel is sandwiched between Grand Central Terminal and the Chrysler building. If you love architecture, you'll enjoy this location. The lobby decor is a little outdated, lots of brass and gold colors, like from the eighties, but it is very clean and beautiful. The front desk staff was super-friendly. In the mornings there is a little \"coffee shop\" in the lobby that serves Starbucks, pastries, and fruits. This is super convenient for taking something up to the room instead of opting for the expensive room service. The corridors and elevators are, again, a little outdated (not damaged, just older), but the room decor is modern, bright and crisp. We had a room with two double beds that overlooked another wing of the hotel and the Chrysler building. The room and bathroom were on the small side, but I hear that this is normal for the midtown area of NYC. It is still larger than the rooms I have experienced in France and Italy. The room was clean, fully-stocked, and everything was in working order. The beds were comfortable and the room was quiet at night. Overall, I would totally recommend this hotel if you are looking for a GREAT location, and a clean, safe, classy, predictable hotel (with good coffee).

This was incredibly convenient for my trips in Junior's! The Grand Central location makes it easy to figure out which subway stop to get off at. Also be sure to take the airport buses that are across the street ... carrying luggage on the subway is uncomfortable and taking a taxi is too expensive. Bus tickets cost $12 for LGA and $15 for JFK.

However, when I stayed at the Grand Hyatt New York, I was so disappointed that I decided to shift to another chain of Hotels which at least keep some kind of standards throughout their chain of hotels. In this Hotel, there were some good and bad points: let\u2019s start with the good, the location is excellent if you are there for business or pleasure. The hotel is connected to the Grand Station Shopping Strip which has many nice shops including a gourmet food store which had a lot of nice stuff, Starbucks, and other coffee shops were very close, transportation was easy, just one thing, DON'T rent a car in New York. I did, big mistake, I rented a mid size car for 79 USD/a day, the parking for 4 hours was more than 48 USD at the Grand Hyatt where I was staying. Imagine if I left the car over night!! Oh the Valet Parking attendant took more than 30 minutes to bring my car, so much for Valet!! If you are not familiar with New York roads, forget your GPS help, it simply just does not work in Manhattan because of all the tall buildings which obstruct the satellite reception, you will be completely lost. Just use the Tube or Taxis and save yourself money and time. The staff at the Grand Hyatt were really friendly, the club lounge was always busy, a bit small for a hotel of this size, but had a good selection of hot and cold drinks and some nice snacks but not a place to have a quite business meeting, one thing was very annoying was that they closed the Club Lounge for cleaning between 1 pm to 2 pm so if you were in a business meeting they politely asked you to leave!!! The Rooms view were not so great, all you will see is buildings around you, but the reception staff went out of his way to please me and upgraded me to a junior suite to make me happy. That was nice of him, but all the rooms which I say (more than 3 rooms) the interior was horrible, plain walls, plain colors, plain fabric, just like a standard 3 star hotel. Clearly not what I was used to in the Hyatt chain in Asia. Room Service very expensive, regular filtered coffee cost about 15 USD. Never had breakfast in the hotel, so I don't know much about that. Oh, get this, no mini bar drinks in the room because there is no refrigerator, and when I asked why, the reception lady said \u201cSir we have more than 1,000 rooms, can you imagine how much work it would take to maintain all these refrigerators? I felt at that moment I was in a motel not the Grand Hyatt. But she did offer to give me a refrigerator if I want one, I told her, ahhh, I just checked out I wish you guys offered me this when I checked in!! The lobby was too busy, a lot of people going and coming, it was more like a mall not a hotel lobby.

I flew into LGA, and the taxi driver told me to make sure I pay roughly the same price on the fare into the Hyatt as when I leave. He said many doormen and drivers have quite the scam going in the city for tourists. I definitely encountered this with the doorman I dealt with at the Hyatt. I specifically asked for a Yellow Taxi. He quickly shuffled me into the taxi who had been waiting in a 'no standing zone'. The driver explained my fare would be a flat rate of $37... $12 more than it should be. I aked him to explain, he said it is always a flat rate on the way to LGA, and that meters are not used. Do not be fooled this is completely inaccurate. I promptly hopped out, grabbed my luggage and moved on to a taxi that was driving by. I was told AGAIN this is one of the many scams taxi drivers and doormen pull on unsuspecting tourists. He also encouraged me to report the driver, as he can lose his lisence.

We prepayed our hole stay at the Grand Hyatt. the service offered by hotel staff since checking in to check out was really great. People had smiles on their faces all the time. They were very helpfull. We had room 3421, on the last floor. It was a simple King bed. Someone told us later that rooms in the 34th floor were somehow bigger than the other standart rooms. (?) Upon arriving, i have to say, the room looked huge! We had a very big bathroom, it had doors in the shower, and not those curtains as seen on some pictures of the hotel. There were lots of space around the sink. The room featured a desk with a nice office chair, a small couch with place to lay your feet, and a good size closet. The closet had an iron and iron table. A very nice 42'' lcd. 2 telephones.and an in-room safe. The King Bed was perfect! Very comfortable and nice sheets and great pillows. LOCATION was the best! The hotel is located right beside the Grand Central Terminal. Its in walking distance of all the sight seeing. And for those who do not want to walk could easily use the subway. It was very cold in new York when we were there, and with cold winds in our face made it even colder. So we decide t use the subway sometimes. The hotel has a direct entrance to the Grand central.,and form Grand central we had subways to all prime locations. There is Shuttle to Times Square every 5 min, and a nice subway line going down-town and up-town on lexington Av. Its very nice to use the subway. This helped us a lot! The hotel didn't provide free wi-fi. They charge $10 a-day. If you stay in all-day i dont think its expensive, but it was not our case, we used only 1-2 hours max from the wi-fi. So I thought the cost/benfit of the wi-fi a little bit over rated. Other than that, The Grand HYatt New York is a great place to stay! The rooms/bathrooms are larger than usual NY hotels. It is very beautiful hotel. Great Location. And it should not be placed in #146 of the TA hotel New York City List. im sure that no one will be unsatisfied staying there. Fantastic Stay at the Hyatt! tip. Small coffee place inside the lobby has great coffee and small variety of food!

Absolutly fabulous hotels!! The first thing we said to each other upon entering the Grand Hyatt New York was..well, this is nothing like the Hyatts in China. That being said, I will now review. We drove into the city and pulled up to the hotel on 42nd street about 10pm on a Thursday night. Not sure we were in the right place as no doorman approached the car, no valet could be seen and no bellhop was around, I went inside. In that lower lobby, there were no hotel personnel so I went up to the main lobby and asked. Yes, they would send someone down to valet the car and yes it was the \"main entrance\". We had reserved a queen bed non-smoking room using a free night earned while staying in China under some promotion Hyatt was having....pay for so many nights and get one free. Can't beat the price but that doesn't mean the attention to detail should be lost. We had just spent 12 nights in China at their hotels, each time upgrading to the concierge level. We were not asked if we wanted to move up to that level....maybe because we were there for free but I still thought it strange that it was not offered especially since you have to pay for it. Our requested room was not available...we could have a smoking queen or a non-smoking double....not good. A king was not offered as an alternative until I asked. Yes, there was one but it too was smoking. So we took it. There was also no mention at check-in of the restaurants in the hotel and the health club availability. Our room was smal, decorated in neutrals, with a nice desk and one chair with ottoman and a large flat screen TV. Far from the elevator and ice machine. The bathroom had the usual toiletries including toothpaste. Small bathroom. We were there on a very cold night. The window was ages old and leaked cold air like crazy. It also did not do much for filtering out New York City noises. Internet is an additional charge. The location of the hotel is excellent. Sitting on Grand Central Station you have easy access to all trains and subway. You are in the midtown and can easily walk to Times Square, 5th Avenue shopping, the Flatiron district, etc. Upon check out, we retrieved our car on the upper level and voila, there were the valet and doorman. If you do arrive on the upper level, you will walk into a very plain lobby and will need to go down the stairs to the main lobby area. It's an odd set-up but probably because of space limitations and the fact that it sits ontop of another building.....Grand Central Station.", "Date": "January 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rising Sun, MD.", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Customer Service!\u201d", "Author": "gmm1974", "ReviewID": "UR54585882", "Content": "We arrived at the Hyatt 12-22-10 and checked out 12-24-10.

It was our first trip to NYC and we selected this hotel intentionally after reading many online reviews, guidebooks and talking with friends. And we weren\u2019t disappointed. The Grand Hyatt met our needs perfectly and was exactly what we were expecting. It is expensive, as is every hotel in NYC. On this point, you can\u2019t fairly compare it to the costs of hotels in other parts of the US. However, compared to other hotels in NYC, we think it is fairly priced and is somewhat of a value. The Grand Hyatt is not a 5-star hotel, and doesn\u2019t claim to be. It\u2019s not a resort destination. So don\u2019t go with those expectations. What you will find, though, is a clean comfortable place to stay. The location at 42nd & Lexington is right next door to Grand Central Terminal. There\u2019s even a walkway that connects the hotel to Grand Central if you don\u2019t want to walk outside. It\u2019s very convenient to many subway lines, which makes getting around the city and returning to the hotel very easy. The area right around the hotel isn\u2019t especially scenic or touristy. It\u2019s in the middle of a very bustling area of Midtown Manhattan. But it is very safe. We even walked back to the hotel around 1am after leaving the top of the Empire State Building. It\u2019s a very short walk to Bryant Park and Times Square. (Or an easy subway shuttle ride to Times Square.) You\u2019re minutes away from everything Midtown has to offer \u2013 Rockefeller Center, the Empire State Building, Fifth Avenue Shopping, Central Park, Macy\u2019s, Theater District, etc. And if you decide not to walk, cabs are plentiful and the subway is also very convenient. Though its location next to Grand Central is very busy, it doesn\u2019t compare to the frenetic pace of Times Square. You can walk there in about 10 minutes from the Grand Hyatt, but we found the Hyatt to be a nice respite from the 24-7 madness of Times Square. Check-in was very fast and easy. The clerk was personable and friendly. The lobby is very big and played host to a couple of different events during our stay. Our room was just as we expected \u2013 small, but functional, clean and comfortable. From what we understand about NYC hotels, they all have very small rooms, compared with other parts of the country. So we weren\u2019t disappointed in our room size. It provided ample space for the three adults in our room. And both the closet and bathroom were, again, small but adequate. As tourists, we weren\u2019t in our hotel room much, anyway. We were out and about everyday, only using the room for sleeping and showering. Everyday, upon returning to the hotel, our room had been serviced. They were prompt about filling requests such as extra towels or hangers when we needed them. We did not eat at any of the hotel\u2019s restaurants. Other food options were plentiful, from the wonderful dining concourse next door at Grand Central, to cafes, restaurants, coffee shops and more nearby. On some mornings we\u2019d pop into Tim Horton\u2019s about a block away for a donut or muffin for breakfast. Other days, we\u2019d go to a nearby coffee shop or diner for a more hearty breakfast. From our room, we could see the top of the Chrysler Building on the next block. But I think it\u2019s safe to say that few of the rooms (if any) provide any really scenic view. The Grand Hyatt is surrounded by other high-rises on most sides, and because the streets are so narrow, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much of a \u201cview\u201d from any of the rooms. We were on the 30th floor, so street noise wasn\u2019t an issue at all. We heard an occasional siren, but nothing that disturbed us. The Grand Hyatt is obviously a hotel that caters to business travelers, thus the high prices for room rates, room service, Internet connection, etc. But it also provided us with everything we needed and were expecting from our NYC vacation, and gave us a great base from which to explore the city. There are certainly more elegant and refined places to stay, more hip and modern hotels, and more budget-friendly locations around the city, but we plan on returning to the Grand Hyatt for our next trip to New York.", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, but....\u201d", "Author": "kseitz", "ReviewID": "UR53845632", "Content": "We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a long weekend in January.

The only mirror in the room outside of the bathroom was in a closet with a dim light bulb. Walking back and forth from our room to the elevator during our stay, we noticed the same room service trays/dishes outside other rooms on several trips. We brought drinks up from the bar and our glasses were in our room for two days. Internet - $9.99/day for T-mobile Hot Spot (SLOW connection). There was no lobby bar, but instead a small bar in the back of the lobby level. We had drinks here one evening...strange vibe - dramatic paintings of Spanish guitar players and flaminco dancers with loud techno house music. We did not eat at the restaurant - also seemed small for the size of the hotel. There was a restaurant just above the lobby with fantastic views, but it is closed. Room service prices were ridiculous...bowl of oatmeal $15 plus tax and delivery. PROS: Location, location, location! The hotel is connected to Grand Central Station by a small hallway.

Anyway, after that the hotel is Great, Fantastic location next to the main station and all that goes with that, easy subway connections and buses all over New York, Yellow cabs are inexpensive in New York compared to london and the drivers are great.

The gift shop i'd miss just for the rudeness of the ppl oh and the price's are way over the top. Take a walk down fifth ave and you'll find plenty of gift shops for half the price. Over all the hotel was really good, with a great location and in walking distance of most sites to see!

The huge waredrobes and cupboard space was very useful, as was the iPod dock (only compatible for Nano tho) I must say the only thing the hotel rooms really need is a kettle and fridge - the type of hotel it is, I can't see why they don't have it... you get a kettle in basic hotels!! Don't even bother buying coffee at the hotel or using their room service unless you have your company credit card paying for it!! Its much similar and cheaper to go to Grand Central Station or to the local Starbucks The location can't be beaten, it is less then a minute walk away from Grand Central Station and really easy to use!!

The hotel had a slightly dated feel - lots of beige! But was spotlessly clean and in immaculate condition. Decorated really nicely for christmas with carols playing while we were there! Our room (2958) was a good size for the 4 of us, the two kids shared a bed, we had great views down 42nd street over Grand Central Terminal. Only negative about the room was no coffee and tea facilities which was shame. Wifi was $10 a day and good basic TV free. The location is perfect, nice and quiet as just of the main times sq area, but really close to the sights. Right next to Grand Central Terminal for the subway/ buses, only a 5 - 10min walk from most attractions, 5th Avenue shops, Times Sq, Broadway, about 15min lovely walk to Central Park via the Rockafella centre (def do Top Of The Rock for views)and 5th Av, 2mins to Bryant Park (craft market fab hot choc and ice rink). We didnt eat in the hotel there was no need, Grand Central Terminal is literally next door and has an amazing food market and lots of great restaurants (mexican, pizza, oyster bar, sandwhiches, bakery etc) , we got bagels and coffee there most mornings and also can recommend Hale and Hearty soups which warmed us up after a chilly day exploring. There's a great diner, Blooms, about 1 block south down 42nd street for some calorie laden breakfast goodies, the french toast with maple syrup and crispy bacon was perfect - dont expect to lose weight on your visit!! The doormen are also great to ask for advice on where to go.

Great, central location and very convenient for Grand Central Station, as well as the JFK and Laguardia airport drop-off bus, which stops and leaves almost opposite the hotel for $27 return (1 hour journey time each way). Very friendly and accommodating staff and a concierge who offered to get a product that we couldn't find from her local shop before coming to work the next day - cheerful and attitude-free staff. Very comfortable and clean rooms, but beware of thin walls - at one point we thought a noisy family were actually in the same room as us. Toiletries provided, but no fridge or mini-bar. There was an ice machine and a basic soft drink dispenser on our floor. Importantly, there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room, which is one area the hotel falls down on. People generally want a hot drink in the morning and offering a room service coffee for $9 + taxes + service charges is quite criminal.There is a small Starbucks in the hotel lobby area, but the queues were often 15+ people long in the mornings, with generally one person serving. With jetlag I was often awake by 6am and I found this was a good time to run down to the lobby Starbucks before the crowds. The hotel is very, very busy generally, which means long waits for check -in and check-out, not to mention the lifts at peak times - be warned and time yourself right! The rooms have wireless internet for a charge and a business centre offering internet access for 50 cents a minute by swiping a credit card. There is also an airline boarding card and check-in machine in the lobby (most airlines are listed), but again the huge numbers of people at the hotel often means queues for the one machine. The hotel gym is probably one of the best hotel ones in town. Clean, modern and with a range of machines. Plenty of cardio machines, a water cooler and towels. No changing rooms or showers in the gym area, however. Check-out is quite early at 11am, but the staff were accommodating at allowing a late check-out at 1pm, which we requested 24hrs in advance.

The bathroom was also small but had an abundance of fresh towels, a strong shower and suitable bathtub. I have no doubt that more well-appointed rooms are available, but for less than $180/night, over Christmas, this more than sufficed for what was a vacation meant to be spent outside of a hotel. Grand Hyatt would have earned my praise any other part of Manhattan, but the location pretty much ensures a top recommendation from me (if you can get the discount rate, of course). I was initially afraid that the location would be too busy/hokey/touristvictimy but, even adjacent to Grand Central, it felt perfectly safe and welcoming outside. And being adjacent to GC is a-maz-ing. We were able to take a bus from the airport, and take a bus or train anywhere we wanted to go after we arrived without worrying too much about negotiating subway stops. This A. Allowed us to spend more money on fun stuff rather than on cabs, B. saved us from that awful feeling of \"how do we get back to the hotel, again?\" at the end of a long day/night. The concierge/front desk staff was friendly and helpful with suggestions about where to see live music or get my handbag fixed.

There were many things that we enjoyed about the hotel. 1. The Room \u2013 The room was a VERY NICE room which was very clean and well appointed. Our King size bed was very comfortable and we slept very well. The living area had a couch, table and chair which added a lot of space to the room and was a very nice place to relax when returning to the room. The refrigerator was a good size and very useful. The flat screen TV was a great size and swiveled to be seen in the living area or the while in bed. The room had a walk in closet that gave plenty of room for our clothes/shoes/dirty laundry and purchases that were made while visiting NYC. In the bathroom, details such as cotton balls / swabs / Q-tips in the bathroom were noticed by my wife as a nice touch. The shower / tub has a temperature dial, and the shower gave an amazing amount of water. What my wife and I liked the most about the room was its serenity from the city. We could crack open the windows to allow fresh air and a little city noise, but we could also close those windows and shut out the busy city. The view was very nice and gave us the great feeling of the NYC experience. We loved the high floor location of our room, and all that we could see. 2. Staff \u2013 The staff was very kind and professional. We were able to check in quickly and had help getting our luggage up to the room. The Bellman introduced the hotel on our way up to the room and told us a lot of useful information such as how to gain access to Grand Central from the hotel, and about the available restaurants. In our room, he gave us a tour and showed us features of our room. He showed us how to work everything and offered to hang our garment bag for us. He got us some ice and was very attentive to us. We had questions on how to get to Lincoln Center and how long it would take, and he was very helpful with recommendations and suggestions on how to get there quickly. We also had a great experience with our room attendant. She was very kind and refilled our ice for us too. The room was always very clean. Everyone that we came in contact with at the Grand Hyatt was very professional and went out of their way for us. GREAT SERVICE. 3. Location - GREAT LOCATION. The location of the hotel was a big plus. Outside temperatures were in the 20\u2019s and we could get a deli sandwich or do some shopping at Grand Central station without bundling up. Because the hotel is attached to Grand Central, we were able to go from our room at the hotel all the way to the Natural History Museum on 81st and back without ever getting out into the cold. There was also a point when my wife and I were sick of bundling up, so we put on light clothes and went down to Grand Central to do some shopping. It turned out to be one of our favorite times. Everyone around us was bundled up, but we were dressed like it was 70 degrees out. We strolled through the shops and the Grand Central Market. We ended up getting something to eat and taking it back up the room. Ultimately, we had spent a couple of hours in the terminal and the shops. We wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that if the hotel wasn\u2019t attached to the Terminal. When we were out and about in the city, we could do some shopping and come back to the hotel to drop off bags, or get something to eat, or take a nap before heading back out to the next venue. There were also plenty of drugstores and/or restaurants all around this location to be able to run out and get some quick toiletries or food if needed. This Hotel is the tops in location. I would DEFINITELY recommend this hotel to others. We stayed here for a 5 day anniversary trip to NYC and we VERY pleased with our experience. My wife and I would like to say thank you to EVERYONE there that made this trip for us possible. We will see you next year. GREAT EXPERIENCE!

I wasn't sure how to handle, but I lucked out by finding a metered spot on 43rd Street; Only about 50 paces from the entrance to Grand Central.

Overall it was a nice hotel, with just a few minor glitches which in no way diminished a wonderful week in New York. Upon check-in, the front desk agent informed me I had been upgraded to a \"Lexington Suite\". It was a nice big room overlooking Lexington Ave., and the Chrysler Building was right next to us. Beautiful view from room 1926! The bed was absolutely wonderful; comfortable and luxuriously soft. I normally have trouble falling asleep in a strange city (especially New York with all the horns honking 24/7), but no problem in this bed. There was a nice flat screen TV which swiveled so you could either turn it to face the bedroom or to face the TV area. Great touch. Other nice features were an in-room safe, an iron and an ironing board. The bathroom amenities were also unique and plentiful. The following are a few minor problems I noticed during my stay: The walls are thin (but aren't they all in hotels these days?). My next door neighbors (room 1925) were a bunch of loud guys who were banging around and yelling at all hours of the day & night. To make matters worse, they were smoking up a storm in the room. The rooms are non-smoking and the smell permeated the hallway and sometimes even came into my room. Nasty. There was plenty of hot water but it takes FOREVER for it to come out [hot] of the faucet. I had to let the water run for several minutes before it came out hot. I guess it had to travel a long way. After a long day of sightseeing and walking, my back hurt, so I decided to take a \"sit down bath\" to relieve my aching muscles when I realized the tub stopper didn't close. I tried and tried but it didn't work. So I used a washcloth to plug the drain (but it didn't work very well!). I didn't bother reporting it to maintenance since I didn't plan on taking any more baths. Oh, and wireless internet is $9.95 for 24 hours. I used it and the connection was fast & easy (T Mobile Hot Spot). Don't bother eating in the restaurants or using room service in this hotel. I cannot comment on the quality because once I saw the prices I stayed away. Nine dollars for coffee (for one person only)? Thirty-Four dollars for French Toast? Really, that is ridiculous, even for New York. And these were the restaurant prices, not the \"jacked-up\" prices for room service. Do yourself a favor and grab breakfast (or any meal) in Grand Central Station. It is right next door and you won't even have to go outside to access it. Just take the corridor on the lower lobby level and make a right. It will take you directly there. There's also a Starbucks in that corridor which is actually less expensive than the \"coffee cart\" in the lobby of the hotel. My favorite place was called \"Hot and Crusty\". I was able to buy 2 large coffees, a bottle of OJ, a bottle of milk and a wonderful croissant for a total of 8 dollars and change. Honestly, I don't know who would ever pay those extravagant hotel prices. I am still in shock! Here's another money-saving tip: If you are coming from an airport, go online and book Super Shuttle. Yes, it is a shared van that makes several stops, but it is a lot less expensive (and easier) than a taxi. My ride from La Guardia was only $13.00 plus tip (16.49). I also used it to go back to the airport. You can save a few more bucks if you book it round trip. Overall a great hotel, just a little bit away from the major noise and crowds of Times Square.

On the Sunday Madison Ave was closed to traffic and a HUGE street market opened which was lovely. Bryant Park which is just along to the right of the hotel was a real hidden gem. We spent lots of time just sitting and watching the ice skaters and looking in all the little units that sold everything from christmas decorations to novelty soap. It was a great place chill and just get away from the hustle and bustle for a while. Also the toilets were beautiful and so well looked after by a lovely lady, who really takes pride in her job. She put Starbucks at the Empire State Building to shame, DON'T use the restrooms at this coffee house as they were the most disgusting I have EVER come across (a 2 foot high pile of USED toilet tissue on the floor under the baby changing unit) and the most worrying thing was that the staff used them too???

The hotel is situated between Grand Central station and the Chrysler building.The Empire State Building is a 10 minute walk around the corner. Time square is a 15 minute slow walk, plenty to see on the way though. I was in New York with my two daughters aged 16 and 21 and although initially worried about walking at night need not have worried as there are plenty of people around. The hotel room was a good size and the beds were very comfortable, on the 28th floor we were not disturbed by traffic noise. I agree with previous comments that the rooms are tired( but only in the yellowing of the paint work) and the bathroom is on the small size but both were clean enough, if you don't look too carefully in the corners and above door frames (grout could do with a little cleaning too.) The meals in the hotel are expensive but for breakfast we followed previous advice and went down into Central Station food court (you can either eat down there or take it back to your room.) There is not a kettle in the room and despite e-mailing the hotel before hand to ask if I should/could bring a travel kettle I did not recieve reply from them. However in the hotel lobby there was a drink station for use on a morning, the prices there were not too expensive. There is a booking desk in the reception area where you can buy tickets for the bus sight seeing tours. This was helpful as I did not like the idea of getting my credit card out on the street to buy tickets off the vendors. I would not buy theatre tickets from there though as you can buy them after 3pm for that nights performance, at a ticket booth in Time square for up to 50 % off. (Unfortunately we had already bought tickets for Shrek through Last minute before we went. It was a brilliant show but we could have got them cheaper if we had waited in the line at the ticket booth. ) However, I think tickets for shows such as Wicked are more difficult to get hold of, so my advice would be to book up with Last minute a couple of weeks before you go to avoid disappointment. All the staff in the Hotel that we met were helpful and polite, having said that I didn't really have any contact with them apart from checking in and out. We had a late return flight and the hotel will mind your luggage for $2 per case after you check out at 11AM, this is also helpful.

As we were unable to use the kiosks, we had to make way to the front desk to be assisted by a human being. What we received was a flash of hatred only experienced as an American youth traveling to Communist USSR in the early 1980s. Instead of assisting us, the front desk agent went back to her keyboard, clacking away while her knitted eyebrows told us that we were almost to the point of death should we bother her with our measly request of checking in to our hotel room. About five minutes later, a second front desk staff member arrived, reassuring us that this was indeed the front desk, and this is where we check in. We were given our room assignment, confirmed my Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum status, and directed to the elevators. Soon, we were on our way to room 1971. As part of Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum status, I'm supposed to get the best room available within the category booked. To all my fellow travelers, I sincerely apologize. Based on the state of my room, I would surely suggest that your rooms were scarier. Room 1971 featured a lovely cracked closet door, mold (not crown mold) around the door of the bathroom, and a toilet wedged between the shower and sink that required the strength and acrobatic skills of Cirque Du Soleil to use. Additionally, for all of those that dislike adjoining rooms - you had not one, but TWO adjoining rooms - one on each side of the room. Nonetheless, the King-sized bed was comfortable, and the desk area along side the TV was useful to complete work on my partner's laptop. The room also had a functional A/C and Heater, and the noise levels (as you faced 42nd Street) were almost inaudible once the window was closed. Our further interactions with the hotel staff were just as cordial as our knitted brow friend, showing us that customer service is indeed on life support at this hotel. When we called to inquire about the correct method to use to obtain free internet, the response was \"If you're Platinum, you should know.\" Yes, because all hotels are the same. As a FYI, When you access the T-Mobile hotspot, and enter your room number, it apparently is automatically removed from your room charges. Bell staff were courteous, and unlike many other NYC hotels, did not tout their friend's town cars or expect tips for helping with bags or hailing cabs. While tips were appreciated, there genuinely seemed to be some helpful staff outside of the hotel. Directions and help with getting our navigation straight was truly appreciated. This, honestly, was the saving grace of service at the hotel - otherwise it would have been a terrible experience. With hotels fighting each other to keep in business in this economy, abusive service and rooms with cleanliness issues do not win repeat customers.

Our rate, for four people in a room (two teens and two adults) was $499/nt. Astronomical rate and they would not budge from it. Since this hotel was where the seminar was held, we really didn't have a choice. We will never again attend a conference at this hotel. Check in was smooth. We were ushered to room 1602. Directly across from the bank of elevators. As it turned out, the room was huge and the elevator noise was not a serious problem. The room itself was in poor condition. On the bedskirt on the bed nearest to the door there was a huge liquid stain of some sort. Disgusting. Every single lampshade had holes and was bent crooked like a brawl had taken place at some point. The carpeting was ancient. Ancient to the point of pulling away from the walls and cobwebs and dust and food had settled into the cracks. I was VERY happy I had brought my slippers. This is the kind of hotel that makes you cringe everytime you look into a nook or cranny. Behind the tv set? Thick with dust and crumbs. Most unfortunate was the fact that this room was connected to other rooms on both sides by reed-thin doors. Forget about getting a decent night's sleep if you have a neighbor who likes to watch television. We were kept up until 3am on a Saturday night by our neighbor's television. The Grand Hyatt touts their E-Concierge service. They have a link to it on their website. However, I sent two different requests to their E-Concierge before we arrived and both requests were completely ignored. The first request was for dinner reservations. Ignored. The second request was for extra towels in our room....an option that their E-Concierge offers. That request was also ignored. We had to phone housekeeping for the extra towels. Every single day. We were promised a coffee machine and a fridge in our room. We had to phone housekeeping for those as well. The maid refused to stock the coffee maker with coffee and cups after the first day. Forget about getting any glasses in the room. We were drinking out of our hands from the bathroom tap while brushing our teeth. If you would like 2 wine glasses delivered to your room the charge is $6. We knew in advance, thanks to TripAdvisor, that the room service charges were astronomical, so we stocked up on juices and water and bagels from the shops down at Grand Central Terminal. One morning, we did order breakfast. One ham and cheese omelette was $24, with no toast and no juice or coffee. The omelette was dry as dust and cold. $24 for an omelette. Astounding. One small box of Fruit Loops was $10 with no toast and no juice. 6 mini pancakes from the kids menu was perhaps the best value. I would strongly advise people to order from the kids menu to avoid being absolutely gouged by the laughable prices. And make sure to order a pitcher of ice water. It's about the only thing that is free in the hotel. All of these complaints aside, the thing that really bothered me the most was the filthy condition of the glass in the lobby. There are several revolving glass doors and a couple of regular glass doors and every single one of them is literally covered in slime. No matter what time of day or night, the lobby was thick with the finger goo and faceprints and palmprints of the hundreds of people who go in and out all day and all night. It's absolutely disgusting. One employee, armed with a bottle of Windex and some paper towels could solve this problem by cleaning the doors once an hour. But this hotel doesn't seem to care about germs or cleanliness. Try it for yourself and you will see that this is a hotel that simply does not care.

We were wrong! Our room was on the 18th floor and we had a view of a high rise, which was to be expected as it is New York City after all and there are high rise building everywhere ;) The windows of the rooms are mirrored so the opposite people in the buildings could not see into our room. This was the least of our problems believe me... The first thing we noticed was mould growing in a corner of the ceiling near the aircon/heating system and also the paint had started to peel away I guess due to the moisture here. We were going to asked to be moved however I wasn't sure that they had other rooms as most if the US Open Tennis players were also staying there too. We also noticed no mini-fridge or minibar. We rang the front desk only to be told that this did not come standard and that you had to request for one to be sent to the room at a charge! I was certain that I read on their site that minibar/mini fridge was included in the room to which the staff member told me she'd send one complimentary. We also had to request bathrobes and slippers (not so much of a hassle, it was just weird that this was also not already in the room considering that this was stated on their site). Amongst other things our room wasn't clean properly everyday, the walls were thin and we could hear people snoring in the next rooms and people walking down the hallways. The staff were not that helpful (but we also found this throughout Midtown...we would always get blank stares, ignored or replies such as \"I don't know\" or \"that's not my job\"!) which was also a huge disappointment when you asked them for something. Everyone passed the buck and unfortunately we had to endure this for 2 week!!! Another thing was the draining system. The drain in the bathtub would clog and your feet would be in a pool of dirty water while you showered until about half way during your shower where most of it would drain away. And at times the toilet would also not flush properly too!! My suggestion to you is to stay somewhere downtown or away from the centre of Manhattan. We received excellent service from retail and food industry as soon as we left Midtown (such as in Greenwich Village, SoHo and also in Brooklyn). Yes staying Midtown was handy to get to Uptown and Downtown with ease, but the NYC Subway and bus systems are so good and so fast that it shouldn't take you long to get from one end of NYC to the other (PS- Subway MTA MetroCards are the way to go. We got a 7 Day unlimited pass for USD$27 and it was gold. You can use it on buses and subway trains all day. Make sure it's not the 7 Day MetroCard USD$20 as this is not unlimited, and made of thin paper card. It just has USD$20 worth of credit and you have 7 days to use it in. What you want is the $27 UNLIMITED MetroCard which is made of thin plastic.) Sorry to get off track...this Hyatt did not live up to it's reputation of silver service.

Well I figured, I was going to take advantage of the NYC diners and eat out always anyway, so I did not ask for the upgrade. I was given some coupons for coffee, that ended also being a joke, because it did not count for any of the coffee I was having. We ended up having breakfast once with the kids, and there came the bill, USD 95! Well, all the dicussion with the waiter, trying to enpower him, did not work, complaining with the front desk, trying to enpower them, did not work (Obviously GH does not empower their employees). I never complain, and thus expected that they would reason with me, yet the held me for a guy who always takes advantages. Too bad! I still like GH, yet not this one, it\u2019s a bad Apple.

I had emailed the hotel before we arrived to request early check in (we arrived at 12pm) - check in is normally 3pm - room wasn't ready, so we left our bags in storage and headed out. Room was ready when we returned. We got into the lift and were ready to be impressed! Oh my word! The room was just awful - vary dingy, badly in need of a refurb. They had tried to tart it up with a modern lampshade, flat screen TV, but the room needed a repaint, was very dark (terrible lighting), awful old carpet....and the bathroom....the sink was in the bedroom area sink was decrepid and vanity worksurface looked like it was about to collapse!), and the bathroom had just a toilet and bath with old fashioned overhead shower. Extremely old fixtures and fittings and it was so small - I am very petite and I struggled to turn round in the bathroom. Poor quality toiletries and on two occassions, maid service forgot to replenish said toiletries. No tea and coffee making facilities in room. No bathrobe or slippers. Bed adequate. Maid service was poor, room and bathroom just got a quick going over, bath not cleaned adequately - and yes, we did leave a tip for housekeeping every day! As we had a club room, we had access to the club lounge for complimentary breakfast, snacks and free soft drinks. Lounge was far too small for the amount of poeple using it - you struggled to get a seat at breakfast if you arrived after 8.30am. Selection of food not bad - but have had a lot better. Staff in the lounge were helpful and polite, especially when compared to reception and concierge staff who we found to be quite cold and impersonal.For $300 per night I was bitterly disappointed.

There was just 1 small window and just enough room to move around, but not much else. (oh, well, a huge walk in closet). I don't have much to stay, it was a terrible stay.

Hotel was only average considering it belongs to the Hyatt Group. The room was extremely dusty - so much so that I could smell the dust.

The room was quite pokey but I had read about NYC hotel rooms being quite small. The bathroom was tiny, the hand basin had no room to put toiletries on whilst getting ready. The hair dryer kept overheating (at least 2 - 3 times) whilst I was trying to dry my hair in the mornings which was really, really frustrating because I had to leave it to cool down before I get started again. We used to put the \"do not disturb\" sign up so that we could have a sleep in in the mornings but when I would duck out to get coffees whilst my Husband and kids were still in bed, I would find housekeeping's cart parked outside our room - waiting for us to get out of the room. I found this to be bit pushy and really wanted to wheel their carts down the hallway, The foyer also needs a bit of a makeover, a lot of gold metal which looks very 80's. The foyer/lobby were always busy. They would put these sheer white curtain things up to try and make an impromtu room within the lobby to host functions - if I had booked a function and it was wedged in their foyer/lobby in that fashion I would be most disappointed. Location of hotel is good. I discovered a great fresh food market around the corner (Lexington) - part of Grand Central (I think it was called Grant Central Market - not sure) but it has fresh breads, cold meats, cheeses, fruits, veges, seafood, cakes, nuts and heaps more. Towards the end of our stay, we got sick of eating out so I would get some fresh bread rolls, cold cut meats, chesse etc and make our own bread rolls. The variety of food sold is outstanding and the smell when you walk around is delicious. Lastly, the rooms do not have fridges but you can request one (I think it was $25 per stay).

I've stayed in a family suite at the Sheraton in Maui (on the beach) for 1/2 the cost, yes HALF the cost of what I paid to stay at the Grand Hyatt.

We went up to our room which was extremely small, trying to stay positive and not show my son my disappointment I went down and asked if a double room became available if they could let me know so we could change rooms. They never did contact us. Once the roll away bed was set up there was absolutely no room to walk around the room. Then there was mold in the shower (which never got cleaned the entire time we were there). The air conditioner made noise the entire time it ran which made it difficult to sleep. There is ABSOLUTELY no counter space in the restroom to set your toiletries on while getting ready. There was only one very, very small dresser under the TV which had tiny drawers in it.

The last couple of visits the rooms have been small but this one couldn't even accommodate a chair in the room. It was right next to the bed so no walking by space.

I feel they could be more accommodating to people who are staying longer and paying a very expensive room rate and/or arriving later in the day. No discounts or reductions given here in the room rate for a longer stay. The rate we paid did include one business shirt to be laundered every day as their website offered but after the second day the laundered shirt would be returned with a $15 invoice attached to it. When I called down to the desk the guy told me it was only one shirt laundered 'per visit'. My husband had to print out their website the next day at work to show the front desk. The desk agreed after seeing the ad that we were correct. However, Housekeeping kept including an invoice on the laundered shirt when it returned to our room. I went to the desk and they told me that the charge would not appeared on our bill upon check out. Indeed, we were not charged. Somehow you think they could come up with a better method so not to confuse their hotel guests. The walls in the room are thin and you can hear all the conversations in the next room. If you are a light sleeper this may be a problem. The one thing I can rave about is their breakfast buffet is excellent. It's very expensive and there is no menu- I think it was $28 per person? so you have to be very hungry to enjoy the buffet (fresh fruit, eggs made to order, waffles, bacon, sausages, incredible pastries, fresh squeezed orange juice, etc.). Otherwise, they do have a coffee stand that sells muffins, bagels & salads but it was a bit annoying that you couldn't order from a menu.

The rates ranged from $139 to $169 per night. We couldn't believe we could get these rates in NYC! Check-in was fairly smooth, and we received the room that we had booked. We were a little nervous about the noise after reading the reviews, so we booked a \"quiet room\" (rm 2428). The room was great! The view was the back of the hotel and surrounding buildings, which we were willing to sacrifice for a quiet room. We heard next to nothing from our neighbours, and very little street noise. We also requested a fridge, which they delivered a few hours after check-in. As it turned out, the electrical outlet for the fridge didn't work (at the time we thought the fridge didn't work), so requested a new one in the morning. When we returned in the afternoon, the fridge hadn't been replaced, so we called again. The new fridge was there when we returned again at 11:00 pm. I also checked the cleanliness of the bathroom when we arrived (a few negative reviews on bathrooms). The shower curtain was not moldy, my only complaint was a few hairs left in the tub and sink. There was an ironing board, but no iron in our room. It took about 15 minutes for them to get one to us. (Much faster than the fridge!!) Our room was cleaned well everyday. The room was really large by NY standards. We stayed at the Doubletree in 07 and found both the room and bathroom to be much larger at the Hyatt. Although the bathroom was smallish, there were some shelves under the pedestal sink to put some stuff. We never ate at the hotel since it seemed pricey and there are so many places to eat in NYC. Thanks to reading previous reviews, we were aware of the dining concourse at Grand Central. Also, fellow Canadian Tim Hortons fans, a Tim Hortons opened just down 42nd St.! (1-2 min walk west) Also, there is a Duane Reade across the street with some food and supplies (no produce though). Check-out was great as well, we found the woman (Patty) to be extremely friendly and helpful. Overall, we were very pleased with our stay.

Well I must say I encountered none of these factors. My flight was 10 late but upon arriving \"Melissa\" checked us in with smiles. I had let her know that my luggage was lost my flight had been delayed 10 hours and things just weren't going right. She promptly gave myself and my family a large back of toothpaste, deodorant, combs, mouthwash, and many FREE coffee coupons for starbucks which is in the lobby. She introduced me to the bellman who filled out a form so when my luggage was to be delivered to the hotel it would be sent right up. She also upgraded us to a larger room but that wouldn't be ready until the next morning. As promised by 11 the next day we had the larger room as promised and our luggage as there and life was good. Every morning we were greeted by smiles and our nights were restful no noise from any of the rooms and the hotel was pretty full. The shower pressure was strong and hot we were on the 28th floor. Now the rooms are smaller than other Hyatts but hey its NYC and larger by that standard. When you check in just ask if a larger room is available because they do vary with the same specifications you may request. The first night we had 2 dbl beds and the room and bathroom was small for the three of us but would be fine for 2 people. The room we went into the next day was perfect again with the 2 dbl beds. I just felt that I needed to write this so that you arrived less worried after reading the previous reviews. We were there for 5 nights and it was in walking distance to all of the attractions. The train station is right next door which offers shops, food and great people watching. On a the corner is a store that is open 24hrs where you can get water, juice, snacks, film underwear, etc and get anything you may have left at home. The area is safe. Now I will say that the room service was a little more pricey for what i usually pay.

I was obliged on all accounts. Arrived at noon and they held our bags for free until we returned later in the day. Easy check in, courteous staff. A bit small, but it is N.Y. If I had pain full price I might be a bit turned off by the room size though. Bathroom was very tiny and had an odd smell, but had granite sink top and Kholer faucets. There was an odd clunking sound in the walls that was 'the plumbing valves' we were told. As i'm a light sleeper I was worried about this, but it did not affect sleeping at all. The decor was modern, though our room's carpet was extremely worn and had a large gum spot. Nice 42\" plasma TV. Bed was very comfortable. Concierge was clutch for booking an outstanding value restaurant on short notice. Being on Central station it is EASY to navigate around the entire city. Really, go ANYWHERE takes 15-20 tops in Manhattan. I'd stay here again for the Priceline price, but not the full room rate of $360+,you could do better i'm sure.

At check-in, I we were both given 'coffee cards' which entitled us to a complimentary coffee, tea or bottled water each morning from the kiosk in the lobby. This was great as it was Starbucks Coffee and there were also other snack items on offer. We only took the free coffee though as being next to Grand Central Terminal, everything you could ever want is there. From Bagel bars to Hale & Hearty Soups, to Pizza and Chinese (although you might not want Chinese for breakfast!) Having arrived at Room 1663 (on the 16th Floor if you hadn't already guessed it) we were surprised to find such a large 2 double bedded room after reading some of the previous reviews on here. There was plenty of room for two guys who had packed far more clothes than was required for our 5 day trip. There was a more than ample writing desk, a large widescreen LCD TV, an iPod docking station, safe and much needed air conditioning. The bathroom wasn't overly huge but then who needs it? The only minus point for the bathroom was that the shower curtain had mildew on the inside which was off-putting. The beds were very comfortable and sleep was no problem whatsoever. I had the bed next to the aircon vent which if you're a light sleeper you might want to turn down or off at night. As for other noise which has been previously mentioned, I couldn't hear it! We couldn't hear any of our neighbours and barely heard housekeeping outside in the corridor either. Overall, the Grand Hyatt is what you would expect from an International Group and shouldn't disappoint with its facilities. There is a very handy 'Duane Reade' across the street (Chrysler Building) which sells bottled water, confectionary, pharmacy items, magazines etc, basically anything you've forgotten to pack. A short walk gets you most places like 5th Avenue, Times Square and the Rockefeller Center. I would recommend the Sightseeing Bus though as walking from one place to another can get pretty tiring as I found out - we did NOT take the bus! If all you need is a clean, decent sized room, a good location and the knowledge that you have a decent brand behind you then you can't go far wrong with the Hyatt. We took a Limo from JFK to the hotel which and returned to JFK in a Sedan. However, a NYC Taxi has a flat rate of $45 to JFK plus the customary tip of course. The guys on the doors at the hotel are fab and will help with luggage. We checked out at 1pm after requesting to keep the room on and after that we stored our luggage with the Bell desk. Be warned that a $2 per item is charged for storage so might be a good idea to try and avoid storing too much. Didn't eat in the restaurant but did enjoy the bar on a couple of nights for a nightcap where the staff are very friendly and helpful. Checkout was automatic and smooth - you don't have to queue!

There was a great view weest on 42nd street from the room. Internet is $10 per day which is not bad for a business hotel (of course many chains now offer it free). The room came equipped with only five hangers and no soap for the bathtub. I called to have soap delivered and it never came. Later that night I called for soap and hangers (we had clothes laid out on the bed and therefore couldn't go to sleep) and was told they would be right up. After 40 minutes, I called again. The hangers and soap finally arrived. The following day after the room was cleaned, we were left with one hand towel and one washcloth. The ice bucket was not refreshed and was sitting filled with water from melted cubes. The shower curtain hung off its hooks in four or five places. Upon check-out we had to store bags for a few hours. The Hyatt charges two dollars a bag for storage. This costs them nothing and is really a cheezy way to make money.

The hotel room was a good bit bigger than expected and was well appointed (although the style was rather minimalistic). The bathroom was a bit small, but was still sufficient; a mirror over the desk would have been helpful for my wife to put on her makeup. Upon check-in, I requested an upgrade from an \"executive queen\" room to a room with a king-size bed and the nice woman checking us in was happy to comply. Additionally, there were copious elevators, so there was never much of a wait (5 for floors lower than 25th, 5 for floors above the 25th floor). The workout room seemed to have lots of equipment and looked clean. We never had help with our luggage (it was offered several times, never forcefully) so I can't comment on the helpfulness of the bellhops. A couple of minor demerits: (A) the bed was not terribly comfortable because it transferred motion to my wife whenever I turned over during the night (but it was still passably comfortable...we have a very comfortable foam bed at home, so my expectations may have been too high); (B) The room was near the elevators and everytime one of them stopped at our floor, it would chime (this was very annoying at 2AM, so bring some ear plugs in case you are near the elevators or are a light sleeper). The only major downside to our trip was that parking was $57 per night (we decided to pay it to save time since we were only in town one night and also since we could take it up with the hotel if the car was damaged...which it was not!) Overall, the Grand Hyatt New York is a VERY NICE hotel and I would definitely stay there again if the price is right! (full disclosure: I got the hotel room through bidding on Priceline.com and the rate was only $105 per night + taxes and fees. If I had paid the rack rate, I would have expected a little bit more, but I would definitely lower my value score!)", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cGrand MOTEL Hyatt\u201d", "Author": "AsiaLovers", "ReviewID": "UR29089407", "Content": "I had to wait for a couple of weeks before writing this review since I was too upset to be objective.

Check-in: long waiting line, they installed automatic check-in machine like in airports but in 10 days I have never seen anyone using them. Room: Small, old and tired, awful bathroom, no space to put anything, my bed was 20 inches from the door (2 bed room), only positive bed was comfortable. Door closing mechanism is very noisy, door doean't close I could see through the door. Noise: As mentioned by other writers, if you want to sleep go elsewhere. This is a motel not a hotel. Student groups everywhere (Easter) partying all night. I had to threaten reception to call 911 for them to do something about it. Club lounge: nice but too small, too many people and no free alcohol not even a beer (5 USD++) the rooms are the same so don't bother to pay the USD 100+ difference between non club and club floor. Unhelpful staff, unless you want to book a show...tried to ask about check-in: NO, check-out: NO i.e. go down and queue like everyone else Staff: never there, no one answering the phone unless it is 2 am and you cannot sleep because of noise.

I loved being right in the heart of midtown, right next to Grand Central Station. I walked all over the place any time I had a free moment. I felt that the hotel did a great job with the conference too...they were good at signage, room set-up, food, etc. Of course, this is my perception as an attendee, not a conference planner. The great service part: I arrived at 7am after a red-eye flight from the west coast. I was planning to drop my bags at the hotel and explore but thought it couldn't hurt to ask if I could check in early. The very friendly person who helped me asked if I would like to check in now, I did! She checked me into a room (with two beds instead of the one I requested, with apologies, but I was certainly not about to complain!). She also suggested that I join the Hyatt Gold club because it would entitle me to as many free coffee and tea coupons as I wanted for the cafe in the lobby. This was great because coffee and tea were several dollars a cup there and I had some each day. The so-so: The room was a fine size and had what I considered a great view, mostly of buildings but it all felt so New York for me who had only been to NY twice in my life before. My complaint was that it wasn't immaculately cleaned. There was dust on the counters and some light fixtures were tarnished.

First of all, New York is a great city, this was my 3rd trip but my girlfriend's 1st, there's too much to see and do there but staying at the Grand Hyatt made it easier thanks to its fantastic location. It's very well located downtown, a short walk from 5th Avenue and Times Square. A longer walk up to Central Park, but that's OK because walking around is what we do in New York, right? We were lucky that we were upgarded to a suite thanks to a friend of mine who works for the Hyatt Group having made the reservation for us, but I would guess that the quality of the furniture, fittings, bathrooms is equal throughout the hotel. And that quality is top class. If there is a downside, it is that the hotel is very very big, and that makes the lobby a crowded and busy place at times, but you have to love the multi cultural nature of New York and being in such a big place meant hearing different languages every day in the lift... Another downside is the costs of additions, wi-fi access in the room was $10 per day and a Starbucks coffee delivered to the room worked out at almost $15 including the room service charge, I'm no scrooge but clearly that's ridiculous, a morning walk into the neighbouring Grand Central Station sourced the necessary morning kick off for a couple of bucks... We used the gym every day, it is well fitted out and was never too busy. The room was great, overlooking the Chrysler building from the 17th floor. The room was well cleaned every day and a good size.

There was no minibar, but we had room service which was prompt and of a good standard. The hotel bar had a great atmosphere and was comfortable with good service.

Had a fantastic first time in NYC. The best thing about the Grand Hyatt is its central location and the fact that it is next door to Grand Central Terminal, which all the cab drivers know. About the hotel, the entrance and lobby are just spectacular and the desk and concierge were very helpful. However, sadly as is common, the guest rooms are a far cry from the elaborate public areas. Ours was basic, pretty small and had few frills. The bathroom was tiny. There was a hairdryer, iron and ironing board. No fridge, kettle or coffee maker however, and room service is astronomic so suggest you take a travel kettle and tea/coffee supplies. The room was quiet and warm, so no problems there. We had breakfast on Christmas day in the hotel, again big disappointment, food was cold, daughter found a hair in her scrambled egg, had to queue with people coming off the street (no special treatment given to paying guests). Cost over \u00a3100 for 3 of us to have basic cooked breakfast which was pretty laughable. Across the street the Pershing Restaurant serves a fantastic breakfast, so comes highly recommended, however costly again, at \u00a350 for 3 of us to have their fab. pancakes. I was told that most New Yorkers grab a bagel and coffee from Starbucks, which are on every corner. Apparently its only the tourists who pay the expensive hotel.restaraunt charges for breakfast! Back to the hotel, the room service was good, left a tip for the maid each day. Had to ask for a few things she forgot to replace, such as shampoo etc. Take LOADS of $1 dollar bills, because everyone has to be tipped. Here's an example $1 a bag, $1-2 a day for chamber maid; 15-20% tip for meals; 10-15% bartenders; cab drivers 15% of fare. Had Christmas day dinner in the Benjamin Restaurant, which is a steak house within a short walk from the hotel. The steaks were the BEST we have ever tasted. The meal was memorable. This classy restaurant is highly recommended as a special treat. The concierge can book it for you. Allow about $45+ per person for a steak plus sides are about $9 each. Weather - freezing! Do not underestimate how cold it is in NYC in winter. We wore thermals and thick tights, and hats and thick scarves/gloves are a must. Lots of New Yorkers wear North Face clothing, especially long coats, because it is SO cold. They sell ear muffs for $2 (the NYPD wear them so they must be considered ok!) they are a must if you want to keep your ears from dropping off. Lots of guys wear dear stalker hats with ear flaps (nice). Once wrapped up however, with sensible boots, you can happily trudge everywhere (the NY grid system is so easy to follow - take a pocket sized street map with you!) and get the subway or a taxi when you are tired. Heres a link to help you plan : [-] We took a full day tour (5.5 hours) with On Board Tours, which was a great day and we saw so much. Highly recommend this tour company. Professional tour guide, lots of getting off the bus and seeing the sites, including a staten island ferry crossing to get a great view of Liberty. This tour leaves every day from Times Square. [-] Also make sure that you go up the Empire State Building and include the NY Skyride, which is great. If you want to go shopping (who doesn't - 50-75% sales are on everywhere) Macy's is great. Unlike rest of US, the New York women are on the slim side, so size NYC US small = 6-8 UK, medium = 8-10 UK and large = 12-14 UK. Any bigger and you need to look for 'womens' in shops such as Macy's and Old Navy There is great shopping in SOHO. (blend of SO uth of HO uston Street, no relation to SOHO London!) . There is also an out of town (about 1 hour away) shopping mall that is supposed to be great. Ask the concierge. Also go to China Town for the famous NY 'knock off' designer handbags. All in all - what a great city. Next time I plan to stay somewhere cheaper, why pay for a swanky entrance lobby if all the rooms in NYC are small??

I did hear other people complaining about room noise, but either we had quiet neighbours, (or they liked listening to us), or our room was jus lucky to have thicker walls. The hotel reception is very modern and grand, but sometimes we felt it a bit impersonal. We like others, found the link to Grand Central to be very useful for the restaurants and for getting about.

The room had climate control which was brilliant as it was snowing when we were there and absolutely freezing so it was nice to turn up the temperature when we got home to our room. Bathroom was small but shower was powerful and gave nice toiletries. New lcd flat screen tvs were getting installed during our stay but the work never bothered us at all and the satellite tv provided was great. We were on the 21st floor so weren't bothered by noise outside but the walls were pretty thin and could hear the guests in the next room's conversation. We were hardly in the room much so didn't bother us. The restaurant food at the Commodore Grill was excellent although the menu wasn't very extensive and was a little pricey. The homemade breads were a nice touch and the service was impeccable. The market grill in grand central was great to grab breakfast in the morning for a reasonable price and the pizzas at 'two boots' there were fab too! Don't eat at the TGI Friday's next to the hotel or the KFC, we grabbed some food from there on the last day for quickness and it was disgusting. The location of the hotel is excellent - walking distance to all the main attractions inc Rockefeller Center, Empire State, 5th Avenue, Radio City Music Hall, Times Square, Central Park etc etc. It was also extremely handy for getting the bus to the airport - buses to all 3 major airports just round the corner from hotel. This was very useful as it cost us $86 plus tip from Newark Airport at the start of the holiday which was a lot more expensive than we had hoped for and a bit of a shock to say the least! It didn't help that the exchange rate for sterling pounds was pretty awful either. You can also grab the subway just next door to the hotel at grand central for $2 each way which was very handy - we used it to go down to take the staten island ferry.

The lobby is grand, but it stops there. You're greeted not by a front desk, but by a troop of check-in machines. This was impressive at first since I prefer it to speaking with a receptionist, but the machine ran out of room cards, so I ended up having to go up to the front desk. It took double the time to check in. They gave me a room on the 19th floor, and my first reaction to the room was, \"This is it?\" The room was small, tired, and the bathroom smelled like wet socks. What was in the room? Queen bed, tv (not flat screen), sitting chair, sliding closet doors, and cockroaches--yes, COCKROACHES. I found them crawling around when I went to the restroom in the middle of the night, and then again in the morning. The man that answered my call didn't seem surprised at all by my discovery. The staff switched my rooms very quickly, gave me an upgraded room a couple of floors up, and $100 credit for food. It was definitely an improvement.

I was informed that it was a Queen Deluxe Room (which I knew in advance). *The hotel reservations person on the other end of the line happened to be one of the Reservations Supervisors. *I explained that I wanted to add my Gold Passport account number to my reservation and after doing so, asked if I could change my room to a King without an adjoining room. *The Reservations Supervisor was very accommodating and handled my request with ease. He told me that although I was blocked with other rooms at the package rate, he pulled our reservation out and put us on the 26th floor in a King Deluxe Room (see pictures) without an adjoining room. *I asked if it would be worth the extra money ($100/night) to upgrade to the Regency Club Floor, but with all of the activities of the events we were attending (ie. lots of food and wine), he didn't feel that the room would be worth the extra money. I really appreciated that. *When we arrived (Thursday late afternoon), our room was just as promised... on the 26th floor, on a corner, away from the elevator and the ice machine and without an adjoining room. *Although we had to deal with noise from a loud family across the hall in several rooms (without adjoining doors!), the overall experience was very, very good. --- Just a piece of advice, my Gold Passport number had not been used in many, many years so I re-enrolled two weeks before we traveled and obtained a new number. Even if you don't plan to stay at a Hyatt very much in the future, it is good to have a Gold Passport number as you will likely get better service as a loyalty customer. Also, I have to say that we have been to NYC 5 times in the last 7 years or so... we really enjoy NYC... and this has been the best hotel experience for us by far.

I've worked in the hotel industry before, however, and know that at this price point, all that distinguishes you from another hotel is your service. The Grand Hyatt's service was dreadful, and I will not return because of it. We attempted to check in early, as we'd indicated on our reservation, and were told nothing would be available until 4 p.m., and that the onus was on us to call and check when something would be open. Annoying, but OK, no huge deal -- though we were tired from the red-eye flight, there was no guarantee of getting a room early. We then asked the snotty front desk clerk for a hospitality room or some sort of place to change our clothes and maybe even brush our teeth. He told us there was nothing and -- get this -- pointed to the lobby bathroom. I'm sorry, but at $250+ per night, I'm expecting slightly more than a point to the bathroom. Thankfully, a nice lobby agent walked us there and tried to talk to us and make up for the front desk clerk's snarky service. We changed in cramped stalls and went out to the lobby to rest for a moment before hunting for breakfast. As I sat down and placed my feet on top of a large ottoman, not 10 seconds passed before a security guard came over and demanded I remove my feet -- from an OTTOMAN. What exactly is it there for if not to rest your feet? In any case, I explained that we'd just come in on the red-eye, were just trying to rest for a moment before heading out ... yeah, nothing but another admonishment. That was the last straw. You don't have a room, fine -- but don't make the whole thing worse by being rude at every turn. The rooms are recently remodeled, so that's good, and they're spacious by NYC standards. Bathroom is absolutely tiny, but clean. Elevator service is fairly rapid, though a malfunctioning one did send us between our floor and the next one down three times before finally taking us to the lobby one day.

Hotels in Manhattan are always far more expensive than elsewhere, and the rooms tend to be far smaller as an added kick in the teeth. Although I was not paying, the rate was only a little more than some far less salubrious places around mid-town, and having done cheap in Manhattan I knew it wasn't a great idea to go budget. On arrival, despite (or probabaly because of) disrupted flights there was a pretty large queue, but there were a huge number of automated check in machines that no-one seemed to be using - walk straight up, check in and get the key, go. Not entirely sure why people weren't using these as if you have a confirmation code or have booked directly with a credit card it couldn't be easier. Good way of avoiding the queue, and although you're never going to get free upgrade you can change your choice of room on the spot even on the machines. I won't go on about the lobby area ostentatious water features as to my mind they are extremely tacky, but who cares? The room itself was, despite being the towards the bottom of the range, incredibly spacious for a NY room - the only downside was a pretty tiny bathroom, but still stocked with good toiletries. I can't comment on the room service as, this being NY on my free weekend, I didn't eat in. But I must say that the staff, who do check that you're staying if you try to get in after around 12am, were perfectly courteous despite me rolling back in a sorry state sometime around dawn. The location is obviously good for midtown - you are on top of Grand Central and all that entails - but as someone who ends up downtown it is not perfect, however hotels downtown tend to be either exceptionally expense boutiques or very rough, and at least taxis always know where Grand Central is. The rates here fluctuate quite a lot, and it is never going to be the cheapest place in town, but the standards are ones you can rely on, more so than at a Hilton, Marriott or other mid to high level hotels.

I didn't think this would be an issue, but if you're not a smoker, the smell is overwhelming. We turned the a/c on and opened the window, but it never really dissipated. The room itself is smaller than average for a US hotel and the bathroom was tiny by American standards. I had asked for extra towels when I booked online and someone came up to the room promptly with an armful of towels. The room was clean (except for the smoke smell), but it's obvious this is an older hotel. One of the lamps in the room didn't work; in fact that outlet didn't work at all. So, they should probably do some updating and fixing to the electrical. The location is the best thing about this hotel. Located inside Grand Central, you have access to the subways plus the dining area, which is very good. Walking over to Times Square took about 15 minutes and was very doable. The Little Mermaid was the highlight of our trip. My daughter has always loved the movie, so it was a lot of fun going to see it with her. The theatre is older, but so beautiful.

I have been a Platinum card-holder with Hyatt for some years, and I must admit that their hotels are not all of the same standard. Most are large and impersonal, but that is the nature of that type of hotel, which caters more for business travellers and (in major cities) airline personnel than holidaymakers. This hotel is huge! The foyer is redolent of an airport terminal, with high ceilings, check in desks, roped off areas and large numbers of seats. Cosy and bijou it isn't, but it is impressive. There wasn't a time when it wasn't teeming with people, and we were struck by the large numbers of school groups that were staying there (perhaps that's why I keep hearing that some rooms are in poor repair ... most young people I have come across are no respecters of others' property). However I have to say that their hotel in downtown Manhattan was one of the best Hyatts I have stayed in. Admittedly I did use my points to upgrade to the Hyatt Regency floor (31st), and I would have been extremely disappointed had any of those rooms been as manky as those described in some of the reviews here, but in fact I was pleasantly surprised. Our room had probably been refurbished in the last year or so, because although there were scuff marks around the lower edge of the bathroom door, the general state of repair was very good, with no sign of wear on the wallpaper or paintwork. The bathroom was small, but not so small that it caused any inconvenience, and the shower produced a good powerful spray with no blocked nozzles. I have always disliked the baths that the Hyatt group install in all their hotels (at least in the USA) because they are usually a bit short and always very shallow, and the idiotic arrangement they have for the overflow - at a level no higher than your toes when you're lying down - means that even a reasonably svelte patron is going to have his or her belly uncovered. I find it impossible to have a relaxing bath in a US Hyatt, so the good quality shower was particularly important. What the average corpulent American does for a bath in this chain's bathrooms boggles the mind. My biggest complaint about this bathroom was that there was no extractor fan, so a shower produced a room full of steam and a completely misted mirror. Not a major issue, just a comment. The room was about 16 feet square and well appointed, with a (slightly too) soft double bed and a TV a bit too far away to enjoy properly without the aid of binoculars. Since we watched no TV other than the news it didn't really matter, but the picture quality was poor and the TV had a fault that made it make a loud crackle and picture jump at regular intervals. I'd have hated that while watching a film, but as I say, we didn't use it much. In keeping with most Hyatt hotels in my experience, the lighting was dismal. I have never understood why this chain is so miserly with its lights, but with no central light fitting in the ceiling (yes, I know it's pass\u00e9) and what appear to be low wattage bulbs in the other lights, the room always had the feeling of being dingy ... which it wasn't at all. Window area is at a premium in New York so the available natural light was also limited. Not a problem and didn't spoil the stay in any way at all, but it's a comment for the Hyatt planners; Let There Be Light. The room was also quiet, and apart from one occasion when a gaggle of idiot women walked up the corridor outside our room conducting a shouted conversation at 4am, we had a quiet stay. The real high feature of our stay was the Regency Club room, which was delightful and something we made use of quite a lot. It serves a complimentary breakfast (largely continental in style), and there's coffee and sodas available free of charge all day. People were going out of that room with arms full of Voss still mineral water as if they were running a stall at the local market. During the day there is free food available, which changes as the day wears on. From the breakfast it changes to other salads and good quality dishes, ending with pastries in the evening. I have no idea how they afford to do this, but I have to say that it's a superb and very welcome service. The best thing of all about the club room, however, is the concierge. This is a person on the reception desk, dedicated to answering questions and helping club members ... and my goodness are they good at it! Each lady (and they were all ladies) was attentive, intelligent, eager to help and very efficient. She has a terminal connected to the Internet, of course, and she will research things for you, advise you on places of interest, places to eat, ways of getting there, and will make reservations for you. Of course the concierge down in the foyer will do that too, but you have to queue for his attention, whereas on this floor you have immediate and high quality attention. To give you an example, I asked for the names of musical instrument stores in Manhattan because I wanted to see if I could find a second hand guitar (a Gibson ES335, since you ask). The young lady told me to leave it with her, and the following morning she had a list of shops, their phone numbers, whether they had that guitar in stock, and the price ranges at which they held them. To say that I was astonished (not to say extremely grateful) would be an understatement. I hope to return to NYC in the not too distant future (we like to go there every few years) and there is no question that I will stay at this hotel, and pay for the Regency Club floor if I don't have the points. A comment about the staff. At no time were we treated in an offhand way by any one. On the contrary we were well treated, even down in the foyer by the desk staff, who don't appear to have a moment's rest most of the time. The mail room too, had a very helpful guy there who assisted me in sending a package. Someone mentioned irritation at the fact that the Hyatt charges $2 per bag to store for the day, and indeed this is true. But when I saw the military-type operation they have to mount to store the bags that were being deposited on the day we left, I would say that $2 is small beer. They must have a store room the size of an aircraft hangar, as the queue to deposit the bags that morning snaked along the foyer and required two full-time people to receive and ticket those bags. Finally a word about the location of the hotel; it's superb. It's a couple of doors down from Grand Central, so the subway is a moment's walk away and there\u2019s a very good food market attached to GC station. There is a deli a few moments walk up the street (on the opposite side of the road), which serves a good breakfast. The hotel is also around the corner from what (in my opinion) is the world's most beautiful building - the Chrysler Building - and is pretty centrally located for walking to the main attractions. It's also on one of those rare occurrences in Manhattan, a two way street, so taxis can approach from both directions, making it easier to get to. And in our case the icing on the cake was that the airport bus to Newark stops just around the corner, so we saved a small fortune by taking that rather than a taxi to Newark. (Incidentally, I'd always fly to Newark now, rather than JFK, it's not much further and it's a smaller and more pleasant airport.) In summary, at least in Regency Club, the Grand Hyatt is a very good hotel and one I would recommend unreservedly.", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brownsburg, IN", "Title": "\u201cFantastic\u201d", "Author": "KCandAJ", "ReviewID": "UR18610008", "Content": "Got a good rate but was still worried about the reviews we saw.

The location of the hotelis great, as it is close to Grnad Central Station (next door) and is a few minutes walk from Times Square. We booked the hotel at an amazing discounted rate, and it was so worth the money. The hotel restaurans are pricy though. Breakfast buffet was $30 per person, so we did not eat breakfast there. (I must say though, that breakfast is hard to come by in midtown Manhattan). We did go downstairs one night for some drinks and desert at the hotel restaurant, as we were too tired to go out.

Our daughter's school group had them booked here and we wanted to be close by, so we took a chance. We got an excellent rate of $223/night through a Hyatt promotion and were very pleased for the value we received in NYC. We arrived at 2 pm and were allowed to check in immediately. When we checked in, we were told there were no rooms with 2 double beds available, even though that is what we requested when we made our reservations 6 month earlier. We were given a room with a king and a rollaway and a promise to move us to a room with 2 beds the following day. We had requested a high floor with a view, but when we arrived at our room on the top floor it overlooked another wall of the hotel! The front desk was very accommodating about offering us a different room, but while it had a street view it was too small to accommodate the rollaway bed, so we stayed in the much larger room with no view. Because our room was not facing the street, we heard no traffic noise, which is very unusual for midtown Manhattan! The rollaway they provided was quite nice and appeared to have a full size mattress which worked well for our teenage daughter. The room was on a short corridor, so we heard no noise from either the hallway or the street . Actually, we decided the large, quiet room with a king bed and rollaway was more comfortable than a smaller room with 2 small double beds, so we stayed in that room for the duration of our visit. After looking a a couple of other rooms, we realized that our room was exceptionally large with a walk in closet as large as the bathroom! It served nicely to both store all our luggage and be used as a private dressing room complete with full length mirror. So, if you want a large, quiet room without a view, ask for room 3428. From the front desk to housekeeping and maintenance, we were very pleased with the friendliness and professionalism of the hotel staff. We experienced a couple of maintenance issues (toilet that flushed too forcefully with geyser-like effect and safe not opening) that were addressed immediately and professionally.

I have stayed at many Hyatts and have usually had great experiences. The experience at the Grand Hyatt New York was not up to my expectations. I had requested early check-in when I had made the reservation on their website. I know this is something that is based on availability and is not something that is guaranteed. Our red-eye flight had arrived at 7 a.m. so by the time we got to the hotel it was around 9 a.m. When we got to the check-in desk and inquired about early check-in the clerk acted almost appalled that we were even inquiring. She said we needed to come back at 3:00 p.m. which was the check-in time. I understand that our room was not available but the attitude we received was not really appreciated or necessary. The clerk had a very thick accent and it was hard to understand what she was even saying so asked her to repeat herself several times. However, her attitude was not hard to understand! We stored our bags with the bellman who also had an attitude and almost scolded us. He said when we returned we must check-in first before we try to claim our bags. When we returned at 3:30 p.m. (30 minutes after their check-in time and the time they told us to return). We waited in line for 20 minutes to be told that our room was still not ready!!!!! At this point I became angry. I explained to the clerk that we had requested early check-in, had been there at 9 a.m. to be told to come back at 3:00 p.m., and it was now nearly 4 p.m. so there was no excuse for our room not to be ready. I was about to ask to speak to the manager and wouldn't you know it all of a sudden a room became available. Their elevator system was confusing. Certain elevators would only go to certain floors but it was not clearly marked. The room was small and dark and pretty ordinary. A few minutes after arriving at the room we heard something at the door. It sounded like someone was trying to get it. I opened the door and there was a hotel employee standing there and almost shocked that we were in the room. She didn't really have an explanation for being there and basically just walked away. I was too tired and exhausted to even call and ask why an employee was trying to get into our room but wasn't really looking forward to another employee with attitude. The next day we had gone out and when we arrived back at the room later in the afternoon it hadn't been made up. However, the housekeeping lady on our floor was standing in the hallway talking on her cellphone on a personal call. How professional! On the day we were leaving our flight wasn't until the early evening. I read in the hotel book that was in the room that they offered a late check-out based on availability. The book stated that they could provide a late check-out as late as 3:00 p.m. without an additional charge. I called at 8:00 a.m. that morning and I asked if we could have a late check-out at 2 p.m. The person I spoked to wanted to haggle with me. If it wasn't available all he had to do was say it wasn't available. I don't know why he insisted on almost arguing about it and then finally agreed. It wasn't an unreasonable request especially when it was stated as a \"benefit\" in their hotel book.

I got a great flight rate, so I decided to Priceline for a 4-star hotel in New York, and I wound up with the Grand Hyatt. I should have known I was in for a bit of a rough ride. And mind you, I definitely know I got a good rate. I would, however, be rather more unhappy if I had paid full price for this place. First, I e-mailed a request to Hyatt e-concierge to see if I could pay extra and upgrade to Regency Club. Mind you, I have done similarly in the past with Hiltons, several Starwood properties, and a couple of Marriotts (the ones that don't close their #*$%@ club lounges on weekends). It's never been a problem. I have also made simple bedding requests of other Hyatts, and I have been treated well. First, I got a flat, \"No\". I then sent an executive e-mail carpet bomb to a few Hyatt higher-ups to see why in the heck I couldn't at least try for something so simple--I wasn't asking for free, I was asking to pay for an upgrade. I actually got a phone call within 2 hours from the Vice-President of the GH New York, telling me the reasoning, and promising that he would check availablilty for me and get back to me. Needless to say, he never did. When I arrived at the Grand Hyatt, I was greeted with a rather gruff young woman who was basically shooing a young couple away when they were asking to change rooms. Uh-oh. I decided not to even ask about the potential upgrade. The young woman in question was fast, but she was cold, demanding, and borderline rude. Great 4-star reception. The room was not clean; there was even trash in the bathroom trashcan from the previous guest. The bathroom wall tiles are plastic, the grout is dirty, and the general feel of the place is very, very tired. The room size is actually pretty big for New York, but the layout was a bit odd. And, as previous guests have noted, the noise coming from adjoining rooms is borderline intolerable. Oh, and our next door neighbors left their room service trays in the hallway the evening we arrived, and they weren't carted away all day until, of course, we were actually drifting off to sleep the next evening. I knew the exact moment, as they made as much noise as humanly possible taking them away. Room service, by the way, is hand over fist the most expensive I have ever seen, and we travel a lot--yes, even to New York. A base price of $23 for a continental (not even including service charges) which is juice, coffee for 1, and a croissant, muffin, OR bagel is kind of, well, insane. Luckily, there are plenty of reasonably priced options within a 2-minute walk in either direction right outside the door. I filled out their survey during video check-out. I did that once at the airport Hyatt in Orlando with a so-so experience, and they CALLED my room within 30 seconds to ask how they could make it up to me. I gave this place a pure thumbs down and heard nothing. Here's the main problem I have. I got a 3-star room, 1.5 star service, and I was pretty much made to feel as if I didn't matter. If I had paid for a 2-star room in New York, I would probably be thrilled. However, this place is supposed to be 4-star, and it just isn't. In any way except for the pretentious lobby. No more Priceline for me in New York. I'll stick to my happy favorite, the Hampton Inn Times Square North. There, I get good, friendly service, a free breakfast, big rooms, luxurious beds, and a stress-free time.", "Date": "May 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay at the Grand Hyatt\u201d", "Author": "boston_tripadviser", "ReviewID": "UR15965502", "Content": "Overall, a very pleasant stay.

I regret to report, however, this was by far the WORST trip we have had in this hotel. Thursday night shortly after midnight a large group of high school/college students who were performing Carnegie Hall entered the next room and began laughing and talking loudly enough in the room next door that the sound was traveling right through the wall, against our headboards. I called security at 12:40 am and security came up quickly and the room immediately quieted down, to their credit. Then the next night, a large group of young women, possibly from the same group, stood in the area around the elevator and were literally shouting with laughter, starting at 12:15. This time I called security within 15 minutes as it was clear they were going to use the hall as a social area.

The beds are very comfortable and all the furnishings are new and elegant. Don't expect much of a view, but there are few places in Midtown that will have a fabulous view.

Booked via Hotwire for an amazing $174/night! They say it is a $400/night hotel which was surprising to us as the hotel seemed to be a bit worn down. It was listed at 4 stars but in comparison to other 4 star Hyatts we stayed in was on low end of that rating. I understand though - \"this is New York\" :) Hotel is hugue, 20+ floors, with huge, over the top lobby. We traveled by car, was a bit hard to get to the front door to drop off the car but after doing couple of around the block circles we made it. Hotel's site did not specify that we should go up the ramp from Park Av. for easily accessible valet parking. Anyway it worked out. Registration was quick, we were upgraded to king size room. Great size of room with king size bed, writting desk, TV armoir and big comfy reading chair. Bathroom was small but adequate and comparable to other Hyatts we stayed in (Toronto, Calgary). Maid service was good. I was happy with the hotel for what I paid. Hotel's location was perfect, just on top of the Grand Central Station, with access to subway, tons of stores, places to eat, coffee shops etc. One night we ate dinner at the mexican place - good experience. At the Station there even was a market place where we picked up fres fruit, cheese and bread for breakfast one day. There is a great breakfast place two blocks from the hotel (Lexington & 39th) called Bloom Cafe. For $20 for both of us we hhad huge breakfast every day that kept us full until early dinner :) For dinner one night we went a bit more south on Lexington (up to 37th I think) to a small italian place called Fagioli. Good food, freshly prepared, at very reasonable prices. We took subway a lot, found it fastest and most economical way to move around. The metro transit map we got from hotel concierge turned out to be our \"best friend\" and took us efficiently from place to place. Only once we took the bus but it was later in the evening. We bought multiple trips metro pass which worked like a charm.

My review goes out to holiday makers who may be swithering over it........ I arrived on the 29th Dec 2007 for 4 nights and was delighted when I walked in the entrance, lovely waterfall, grand decor. No queue at check in, girl was lovely and even though we were 3hrs early our room was ready. We got a king deluxe. The room was clean, bed was comfy and luckily our view was excellent (chrysler building). The cleaners were in everyday, bed was changed, towels replaced, bathroom cleaned all the usual, plus as a bonus a paper (New York Times)was left every morning, no charge. The only thing I would say about the rooms are that the walls must be very thin its quite easy to hear next door and prob vice versa however this was not majorly offputting at all and given everything else who cares cause what more could you want, seriously, your in New York, how much time are you going to spend in your hotel room if your on holiday! Staff were very friendly throughout, we didn't eat in there but had a drink at each of the bars, expensive, normal for hotels, but comfortable...(theres a lovely cafe 'Pershing' across the road to the right for great breakfast)...there are a couple of shops in the hotel which we discovered last day! (should you need the usual keyrings etc before you go please try the gift shop before you leave the lady in there is lovely!) To check out you can do this self service or use the 'human' which we did and was fine, plus gave us a chance to say how happy we were with everything. So should you be pondering over the Grand Hyatt, please don't. If you want a lovely hotel thats close to everything (next door to grand central station for every subway you need, five mins walk to bryant park, 10 mins to times square) then go for it!

I am giving it a 3 rating because it is just about what I would expect of an average 4 star hotel in NYC in that price range. I would give it a 4 rating based on our discounted priceline rate, but I think it is only fair to review it based on the published rate. The Hotel is so conveniently located within Grand Central Terminal that if you arrive by train, you never have to even step one foot outside before reaching your hotel room. You can also get to almost anywhere else in the city from there. We took the train from Stamford (just 45 minutes to Grand Central) and within 5 minutes of arriving at Grand Central Terminal we were checking into our hotel. The line wasn't too long, about a 4 minute wait. There are many electronic check in kiosks, but we opted to check in directly since we prefer a more personable check in, and to make sure that we are happy with the room they selected. The front desk was very pleasant and found us a very nice room on a high floor with a King bed. Views in this hotel are very limited since tall buildings surround it on all sides, but we were able to get a decent view of the Met LIfe Building. In the end it hardly mattered, since we were not in our rooms that often and when we were, we had little interest in staring out the window anyway. The Hotel is very large with a beautiful Lobby. Unfortunately the large marble waterall/fountain was out of order, but I can imagine how beautiful it must be when it is working. As some other reviewers mentioned, you can hear some hallway noises, conversations, and televisions from the neighboring rooms from time to time. It was not unbearable, but perhaps it is worse when the hotel is at full occupancy. Hard to know. Some better soundproofing would be nice, but this is fairly common in large hotels. One noticeable plus was the over sized walk in closet. Not sure if this is standard or if we just lucked out, but we had a walk in closet that was almost twice the size of the bathroom. They had an ironing board in there, which is also a huge plus. You need to pull it out to iron, since there are no outlets in the closet, but it wasn't an issue. The bathroom is a bit on the small side, but perfectly fine. It was very clean with marble and granite and very nice Portico bath products and a hairdryer. The shower pressure was decent, with a large Speakman shower head. The towels were a bit rough, likely from countless washes, but fine. Some reviewers mentioned that there was no toothpaste offered, but from my experience at many hotels, toothpaste is almost never offered unless requested. I'm sure if we needed it they would send some up, or you could easily go down to the hundreds of shops in Grand Central Terminal and pick up any supplies you need. There is a convenient ice machine and vending machine on the floor just down the hall from the elevators. There is no mini-bar in the room, but this ended up saving us a lot of money in the end. There are plenty of delis and stores all around the area, so you can get outside food and drinks easily. We did not order room service or eat in any of the hotel restaurants. The fitness center is better than most NYC hotels, with plenty of Life Fitness brand machines and towels, water, and full cable television programming on the ellipticals, treadmills, etc. At first I was sorry I didn't bring my own headphones, but soon I realized that they supply you with free headphones near the towels. The only downside was on our second day when there was some error with the red emergency phones within the Gym. At one point during my workout, about 2 Hotel security guards and 3 NYC police officers stormed in to the fitness center to respond to an emergency call that (apparently) no one had placed from one of the many red emergency phones within the gym. The Police came back a couple times during my workout, creating a distraction and speaking in a very loud and accusatory tone warning us all not to touch the red phones or they would shut down the fitness center. It was very uncomfortable. I was close to finishing my workout so I decided to cut it short. I have no idea how it ended. Either way, I felt the Hotel security could have handled this situation much better by putting a security guard there after the first incident or having better surveillance cameras. I'm sure there was a technical problem with the phones, which should have been their first consideration before assuming it was a prank or somehow intentional. On the bright side, if there ever is an emergency there, at least you can be assured that the authorities will arrive within seconds. The cleaning staff was very efficient and left our room spotless every day. We had a small problem with our in-room security safe. The safe was already closed and locked beforehand, so we could not use it. We called the front desk and they sent a security agent over (within minutes) but they could not fix it since they needed special equipment to drill it open. They apologized for the inconvenience. It was fine, since the Hotel is very secure anyway. Overall, it is a very nice hotel and we slept very comforatably each night, which is the most important aspect of any hotel. The beds were very stylish and comfortable. The rooms were spacious for NYC standards. Because it is such a large hotel, I realize it is often hard to get personable service, yet we had many positive experiences with the tour desk, cleaning staff, and other hotel representatives. It did take a bit long to get the front desk to answer the phone, but it varied depending on the time of day and how busy they were at the time. At one point we were on hold for over 3 minutes and I just gave up but on another day they answered it right away. The most important thing to remember is that if you smile and are pleasant and nice to people, they will usually smile and be nice back. You can help make your own experience better by having a positive attitude. If you are uptight and demanding to anyone then you are unlikely to be treated well and will be unhappy with service anywhere. Contrary to several reviews on this site, no one within the hotel staff was ever rude to us during our stay. Everyone was very pleasant. If you can book this hotel at a discounted rate, it is an excellent choice. On the other hand, if you have money to burn and want complete pampering and perfect service, then I would suggest a higher end hotel.", "Date": "January 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago, il", "Title": "\u201cRooms Drab, service zero, location fabulous\u201d", "Author": "ruchirabajaj", "ReviewID": "UR12536686", "Content": "Grand Hyatt, is at the perfect location, right next to Grand Central, Time Square, Cabs, and all the other fun placed to be in New York, if you are a tourist.

From the time we handed the car keys to the valet, to entering our room on floor 16, it only took about 8 minutes. The lobby is impressive,clean and busy with people moving in and out , so this is a great place for people watching. The staff was helpful and smiled even with a full house! Room- This is the major downfall of this hotel. It has nothing to do with the size of the living space or the bath. It is all to do with the cleanliness, which I have to give a 2 on a scale of 1-10. Moldy shower tiles, bath floors which look as if they have not seen a clean mop in years, dust and \"stuff\" all over fixtures,window sills and with no exaggeration, years of dust under end tables and by heat fixtures. This would lower my rating to a category 3 at the very best. We ate out, and I suggest using Open Table, a internet reservation site which can aid you in finding a great restaurant, not only by category,but also by neighborhood. I found this site about 3 years ago and it is priceless in most cities. You can find restaurants on very short notice and eliminate the waiting game. Reviews are linked to this site,as well,so you should be able to find the right food at whatever price range that you choose. We did eat breakfast at the hotel, which has only one restaurant open in the am and encountered a long line. After about a 30 minute wait, we ate the buffet (at $30 per) which did have a decent amount of choices at typical NYC rates. HINT: Go downstairs into Grand Central Station which has a huge dining,floor with many,many dining choices. Real restaurants, as well as fast food in a historic setting. There are loads of stores underground,as well,so do not miss this detour! Overall, if you are looking for a great location and can live with questionable cleaning of guest rooms, make sure you get a great deal. If not, try to stay at the Intercontinental or Waldorf which are within a couple blocks!

I also thought that the \"StayFit\" fitness facility was quite nice - clean, well-stocked, with very modern equipment. Very impressive The OK: The room was clean and well-kept. The desk space was workable and the TV was functional. The closet was good, and there was drawer storage. But overall, the room was very, very SMALL.

I'd made arrangements for a surprise - \"Milk and Cookies Package\" - to be delivered at 8PM for my kids. I did this via the E-concierge. Upon arrival, there was no record of the request (despite my e-mail \"confirmation.\") The front desk staff tried to help re-arrange things, but room service called to confirm a \"New York Survival Package\" 30 minutes after we got to the room (4PM). I straightened that out, only to have the \"Milk and Cookies\" sent right away (at 4:15PM). The people in Room Service were unhelpful, surly, and I sat on hold for long periods of time.

The Restaurant and Bar Service was equally uneasy in respect to serve you as a Paying Hotel Guest.

This wasn\u2019t ideal, as we had so much luggage and had to put it on the hotel trolley ourselves. Eventually, a porter came and showed us the way to reception and waited expecting a tip - having literally just arrived from a 24 hour trip from Australia, we had some US cash but not broken down. Ordinarily I would have gone out of my way later to find the porter and give him a tip, but he was so unfriendly, unwelcoming and not that helpful that I didn\u2019t bother. On the other hand, we found the reception staff generally helpful and concierges great. We were upgraded to a suite, so had a big room with a separate sitting area with was great for our baby. This was unexpected and made a one week stay with a jetlagged baby much more bearable. In terms of our requests, the hotel did do everything that they could to assist. Location is good, being so close to all of the shops, Grand Central Station, not too far to walk to Times Square, Rockerfeller Centre, Central Park, Bryant Park and Empire State Building.

This is the first club lounge I have been in that doesn't have free drinks at cocktail hour - cheap! The selection of \"hors d'oeuvres\" was okay but certainly nothing special. Basic cheese and crackers and some sushi rolls. Good Starbucks coffee and a decent continental breakfast but the space is too small for the number of guests.

I think they hired some homeless people from around Grand Central to lay the carpet - it is unraveling all along the baseboards and doorsills. The door frames are metal but some untalented interior designer decided it would be a good idea to paint them to look like wood. It just looks like a bad imitation of wood. There is no artwork on the 3 main walls and the lighting is terrible. The bathroom is small but serviceable. The bathtub has some newer marble tiles but a little Tilex and a good scrubbing are in order. The temperature control wasn't working properly and none of us slept well because the room was so hot. It is possible to open the windows but this is New York so our choice was street noise but \"fresh\" air or quiet and hot and stuffy.

I did not complain as I was paying the lowest available room rate. It was also very warm and the air con didn't seem to cool it (although the window did open). It is expensive but then most hotels in New York are but a tip I would pass on is if you catch the airport non stop 'bus from JFK this terminates just opposite so you can save some dolllars on cabs/other transportation. Breakfast is a varied buffet - around $37 with a 15% tip, but there are alternatives in the area (I tried one 2 blocks down Lexington where a cooked breakfast with coffee, juice - & a bigger tip! - was $12) I asked for a late check out and was given 1.30pm which helped as my return flight was 6.15pm which saved the $2 charge for luggage storage(?)

We figured since people had just checked out and housekeeping was just getting around to cleaning it up, but for the duration of our stay there was constantly trays outside. Luckily our room was well appointed with the updated linens and decor. The room was bigger than I imagined with a king size bed, tv with cable. The bathroom was definitely New York sized though, and I didn't feel like it was the cleanest hotel bathroom I've ever been in. But it did have nice Lemon + Lavender scented toiletries. As well as a so-so hairdryer. Our biggest complaint was the noise. The walls were paper thin and we could hear the guy next door sneezing and coughing as well as people talking in the hallway. Another complaint was the price of room service. Yes, this is New York, but $8 for a cup of coffee + $5 delivery charge + 15% gratuity + 2% tax? We're talking almost $15 for one coffee. I don't know who was able to afford all the plates of food we kept seeing in the hallway.

However due ro numerous flight cancellations and delays due to weather and personel problems, we did not arrive at the Hyatt until after midnight. At this point expecting another disappoinment, I was not. The woman at check in was extreemly nice and empathetic getting us through that and to our room very quickly even recommending a late night deli nearby if we were hungry - which we were. Let me say that the lobby is gorgeous, the hallways very tasteful and our room was a beautiful sight! It was large for NY standards, clean, smartly decorated, not tired and worn, and had a spectacular view from the 29th floor overlooking Grand Central and 42nd Street. During our stay, everyone at the hotel was courteous, helpful and pleasant from start to finish. The only negative I have is that we ran out of toilet paper one day when we returned from sightseeing, apparently not refilled by housekeeping that day and had to wait 45 minutes after 2 phone calls to get more. The coffee stand in yhe Lobby is great and convenient and the food at the hotel is excellent but very expensive. However there are many good restaurants nearby that are reasonably priced. Our favorite was called Annie Moore's on 43rd Street about a 1/2 block past Grand Central. The Grand Hyatt's location as everyone says is perfect for getting just about anywhere around New York.

I was travelling alone. I booked the hotel via Hyatt.com, and got a special rate using a code from the Travelzoo website. My stay happened to coincide with the steam-pipe explosion in New York, which happened 1-2 blocks from the hotel, so my experience of staying there was probably a bit abnormal, but nonetheless I enjoyed the 5 nights I spent at the hotel. I arrived in New York by air (from Philadelphia) and made my way to the hotel via the New York Airport Service bus, which drops off at Grand Central Station, next door to the hotel. You can enter the hotel either from the street or directly from Grand Central Station. The lobby interior is extremely well done, and if anything is a little over-the-top! Access to the lobby from either entrance is by escalator or stairs; I'm sure there must be a lift too, but I didn't see one. Check-in was hassle-free, though I arrived at midday and my room wasn't ready until 3pm (as advertised). They stored my luggage free of charge (there's a $2 charge per item if you store luggage after checking out) leaving me to go out and explore the Big Apple before getting into my room. The hotel is ideally located right next door to Grand Central Station, in Midtown Manhattan. If you're unfamiliar with New York the main city is on Manhattan Island, with largely residential areas on Staten Island, Brooklyn and the Bronx. Uptown Manhattan has Central Park, while downtown Manhattan is home to the financial district. No prizes for guessing where midtown is :-) It's a good idea to use the metro to get around, and don't even consider driving - the traffic was absurdly bad! My room, when I got into it, was on the 20th floor of the hotel. It was large (I'm told a boxroom is the norm for a hotel in NYC, but this room was very spacious) and featured a small walk-in wardrobe, a comfortable King bed, a desk / working area, a small couch and TV, and a small but well equipped bathroom. (My room was at the end of the corridor so may have been slightly larger than others.) I was surprised to find there was no tea/coffee making facility in the room, nor was there a minibar (or an empty fridge). Perhaps I'm too used to traditional British hospitality... There was a fitness centre on the top floor of the hotel and though I didn't use it, it seemed fairly well equipped with weights / cardiovascular machines etc. It gave a great view over the city too. I only ordered room service once; returning from a Broadway show I had a craving for chocolate cake and milkshake, and it was delivered to my room within about 10 minutes of calling downstairs (at 1am). It was fairly expensive at almost $30 including tip etc, but worth it!!! I think there was wireless internet access in the public areas of the hotel, but I'm not sure if there was (free) access from guestrooms. The 24 hour business centre provided internet access at a hefty price - I think it was something like 50cents / minute, which to me is very expensive considering the cost of a room. As I mentioned above, the first night of my stay was when the steampipe explosion occurred in New York - scary, to say the least. For the remainder of my stay (until I was leaving for the airport!) the only access to the hotel was via Grand Central Station, but there were plenty of hotel staff around to provide directions and so on. Check-out was relatively hassle-free but I did have to wait in line for 5-10 minutes before diong so, which was quite annoying. The hotel has around 1000 rooms and I think you can check out by phone or with an automatic machine too, but I chose to wait in line with the 999 other people ;-) To be fair the desk staff were very fast at processing the queue, and my bill was in order when I was served. Overall this is a comfortable hotel in the heart of New York City, but I think with such high room rates the business centre should be free, or at least much cheaper than it is. If you need internet access like I did, head for Burger King at Times Square - it's only $5 for almost an hour!!!", "Date": "August 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tallahassee, FL", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "rtrusik", "ReviewID": "UR8419788", "Content": "We stayed there on 7/24/07 - 7/28/07 - about a week after the steam pipe explosion.

We also saw quite a few police officers which was good. Right up the street is the soup man restaurant or the \"Soup Nazi\" as Seinfeld called him. They do have great crab bisque. There is a great japanese restaurant about 3 blocks away called Riki which had amazing sushi & the best fried rice at reasonable prices. Back to the hotel - we found the rooms to be upscale, well kept, and clean. Our bath was also clean. The lobby is nice and the gym was also. The gym was free which is unusual for most upper class hotels. We paid about $211 per night plus tax which is very good in NYC. We felt that it was a good rate for the hotel & location. The concierge was helpful finding places for us - told us about Riki. They were very busy so sometimes you had to wait a little bit before you got help. We would definitely stay there again. You are 4-5 blocks from Times Square and you can catch the S train shuttle which only goes from Times Square - Grand Central Station and back. Very convienant to use the subway & bus.

We have previously stayed at Hyatt locations in Europe so we had high hopes for our holiday accommodation. Our regret is to let you know that our stay at Grand Hyatt New York was a terribly disappointing fiasco. During our check in, after we had waited in the line for a long time, we were appointed to an awfully worn smoking room with absolutely no view at all. The room smelled so terrible that my fiancee got a migraine headache. When we requested a room change, we got downgraded to a lesser room which we accepted, because it did not have the smell, and we also could see out of it's small window. The television in the room was useless because we could not find it's remote control, although we searched the room as well as we could. The room did not even have a minibar. We did not mind the weariness of the property, but because our room was not cleaned properly, especially the bathroom was disgustingly dirty during our visit. This we could not expect in supposedly high class hotel. The service was generally inefficient with a careless attitude towards the service. We had to wait for three days before our laundry bag was collected after 5 phone requests. Once in the evening when we were ready to go to bed, we noticed that our bed linnen were changed into dirty sheets with stains in them. At this point we were so tired that we desided to not call housekeeping and just slept without the sheets. Also, the communication with the staff was sometimes quite difficult, because only few spoke english. The concierge service could not help us even with the most general questions, so we had to find out everything in the town by ourselves. For example, when we requested whether it is possible to find a swimming pool in Manhattan, the concierge told us that it is something that people do in Miami and is not possible unless we are guests in some other hotel. So we went to a beautiful rooftop swimming pool located at only a couple of blocks away from the hotel, which we found by using the Google internet search. The hotel's restaurant was vintage from the 80's. The service was unprofessional, for example when we ordered a glass of champagne, we got a glass of cava. After complaining we were told that the restaurant does not serve \"the real champagne\". The only thing high class was the restaurant's pricing. The staff's only talent seemed to be getting tipped even if there were no service what so ever. We had to pay all together $25 just to get out of the hotel with our bags, which we carried by ourselves. A taxi that the bellboy arranged for us took us to the airport with a fixed \"taxfree\" fee which was much higher than a metered fee would have been. The arrangement was not told us before got to the airport when we requested a receipt for the trip. We never received our complimentary morning beverage, which we are entitled to because I am a Gold Passport Platinum member and although we stayed at the hotel for six nights. When we checked out, we received 57% reduction of the morning beverage price which was in total $160 and we ended up paying because of the confusion. Also, I did not receive the Gold Passport bonus points that were offered to me for the stay. The customer service did never reply to my letter and I never received any compensation for the room downgrade, although I had prepaid for a deluxe room. We will never stay at Grand Hyatt New York again and I doubt that we will stay at any Hyatt location again in the future.", "Date": "July 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cA bad experience from start to finish...\u201d", "Author": "travelingirlUsa", "ReviewID": "UR8240469", "Content": "I generally stay at Westins and this is one example of why I'll choose other hotels over a Hyatt.

Once our luggage was lined up on the curb, again, neither man offered assistance. Nor did they point us in the direction of the front desk. I'm a Gold Passport member and, despite the fact that my profile specifically states that I prefer quiet rooms away from the elevator, the room we were assigned was directly across from the elevator (noisy as hell during a conference, btw). When I asked for a room change, I was given a tiny room--literally, when you walked into the room, you almost tripped over the bed. Considering how small the bathrooms are--and the vanity has absolulely NO space for toiletries--we needed a second mirror in the room. So we stuck with our initial room, which was a step up from the tiny cave they offered us when we requested the room change. No amenities in the room--no coffeemaker, bottled water, refrigerator or mini-bar. I've had better amenties and customer service at lesser brand hotels. And what is the point/benefit of being a Passport member, anyway? The customer service was awful. I asked the tour hostess for a map and she literally threw it on the counter as though she was annoyed that I'd interrupted her (doing nothing by the way...).

Check-in was simple - no problems there. The room was decently sized but definitely run down and not well cared for. There were stains on the walls. The full-length mirror on the closet door was filthy. I had them bring me a new desk chair since the original one had a large stain on it. Overall, none of the employees was especially personable. The bed was comfortable, but there were a variety of stains (black marks, what appeared to possibly be makeup, etc.) and holes on the worn sheets. A few random hairs were spotted in the room (on toilet, between sheets, etc.). The bathroom was small - not enough room to place your toiletries on the vanity. The bathtub in my room needed to be reglazed - it appeared quite dirty and I'd recommend that anyone who stays here bring flip flops to shower in. The towels were worn, clean, but quite used and there were one or two towels whose stains bothered me so much that I chose not to use them. I requested extra towels all three nights of my stay. The first two nights I requested towels all went well. But the third night, the man who delivered them seemed a bit bothered and barely grunted a greeting when I opened the door. Daily housekeeping was not great - it looked like someone rushed through the room on a tight time schedule. You could see the wipe marks on the faucet and you could also see spots on the vanity that the housekeeper missed. Given the details that were overlooked, I wondered if the housekeeper assigned to my room might have been cleaning the room with her eyes closed. The concierge was helpful in identifying a spot for dinner one night, but not too detailed in giving directions. This was quite a lackluster experience overall and I have to say given my recent stays here and at the Grand Hyatt DFW and the one attached to the airport in Chicago - I can't imagine that I would choose the Hyatt for any type of a vacation stay. The best feature of this Hyatt is its location. There's a Duane Reade right across the street if you need toiletries. There's tons of shopping close by (Ann Taylor, Kenneth Cole and much more) as well as good food and touristy features like Times Square. Another note, two of my colleagues also had complaints. One needed to be moved to a different room. The other one said that the sheets on one of her beds appeared to be dirty - so she ripped them off to make sure they put new ones on the next day.

The location was wonderful as my sister/niece were able to take the train directly to the station from Boston, and I was able to get a shuttle directly from Laguardia airport for $21 round trip with my daughter free [--]. In addition, we were right above the newly renovated train station, which could easily get us anywhere around the City without even going outside the hotel. Also, easily walkable was Times Square (about 10-15 minutes) and Rockefeller Center (easy 10 minutes). We had arrived early at about 1pm on a Saturday and I had previously requested an early check in. I am a Hyatt Platinum member, so Hyatt usually does the best they can to accommodate me when I stay at their hotels. The receptionist immediately told me they did not have a room and seemed a little bothered. He would not even give me an idea when one would be available. We decided to stay in the area for lunch and checked our bags with the bellman. We returned about 2pm, when another receptionist told us they were sorry, still no rooms--again not very helpful. We were pretty frustrated as we wanted to change clothes and head out for a bike tour (great time--centralparkbiketour.com) through central park and we were killing most of the day. About ten minutes later I went to another receptionist who miraculously came up with a room for us when she did a little further computer research. We got a double room (no view) on the 17th floor, which was very nice and actually pretty big for NY standards. The bathroom was on the small side and very plain, but all was clean and comfortable, especially the amazing Hyatt beds. Other issues with the hotel were that there was not a coffee maker in the room. We did get tokens for coffee downstairs, but one of us would have to get dressed and run down there each morning. In addition, it seemed like the walls were very thin and we could hear everything in the rooms next to us. Overall, we still had a good experience as the location was superb and the hotel had the Hyatt comfortableness. Another great plus was this wonderful food court in Grand Central station that had amazing fresh foods, deserts, breads, soups, seafood, etc. Another area of the station had an awesome gourmet market and wine shop, with a great selection of chilled bottles--all easily accessible directly from the hotel's lower lobby.", "Date": "July 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "BillClo", "ReviewID": "UR8062760", "Content": "We stayed in the Grand Hyatt in April and I would return here everytime.

I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt several times in the past two years, and generally find it is an acceptable business hotel. They have large meeting facilties, so many of the New York investment banks hold Investor Conferences here. This trip I arrived to find I had been upgraded to a larger room than normal. The room had a large entry area that was separated from the bedroom area by a credenza with a TV on it that rotated to be viewed either from the bed or from the entry area. The room was clean, but it smelled like it had previously been a smoking room that they had sprayed \"clean\" to use it as a non-smoking room. There was a large desk, which made working convenient, along with a comfortable chair near the bed. The closet was large, but the bathrooms in the Grand Hyatt are extremely small with virtually no counter space for sundries. However, the rooms were remodeled in the past few years, and are reasonably nice. Also, the beds, pillows, and linens are very comfortable. I used the fitness center, which has a good collection of cardiovascular equipment with individual TV's, and a small amount of weight equipment. The fitness center also has a nice view of the city. I ordered room service, which took almost an hour to arrive, despite the 35 minute claim. The food was delivered hot. My only complain was with housekeeping. When I arrived, I called to ask for a robe to be sent to the room. I then went to workout. I returned to the room 90 minutes later, and there was no robe. Housekeeping explained that their deliver had not come yet, and they would send one up as soon as they arrived. After showering from my workout, I noticed there were no bath towels in the room. I called to request bath towels, and a few minutes later, the robe I requested was delivered. Then, I called again for towels 30 minutes later, and a second robe was delivered instead. I called again, and finally the bath towels were delivered. I haven't had this problem with housekeeping on prior stays. I am in New York every 4-6 weeks for an investor conference.

We asked for two doubles and each got a king and had to have roll-a-way beds brought in. In addition to that, they also had our rate incorrect by $30. They corrected this but then wanted to charge an extra $20 for the roll-a-way since they said two doubles was not a guarantee unless you want a room on a smoking floor. Frankly, I think this tactic is an insult. So as far as what we got... What was great: the property location. What was good: the bed comfort and the room size (until we had to accommodate the roll-a-way). The bad: the rooms do not have a coffee maker (although we got a complimentary cup upon checkout), no refrigerator (can't bring any drinks or perishable food to your room) and there is no full length mirror. The only mirror is the one above the sink in the bathroom. Not good when two people are trying to get showered and dressed at the same time. Also, the bathroom does not have a fan so it gets pretty steamy in there. We all had cold showers or the water would run cold then suddenly become very hot, then cold again. The towels were rough. Also, this is the only hotel I've ever stayed anyplace that charged guests ($2 a bag) for storing bags at checkout so we could spend more time in the city.

I secured a reasonable corporate rate ($249 for a deluxe room) First, the rooms are older and dated. The first room I was given reeked of smoke, although it was a non-smoking room. Housekeeping sprayed some air freshener which helped. In addition, there was mildew on the ceiling of the bathroom and smudge marks on the surfaces and furniture in the room. The television was an old fashioned clunky TV (weren't all Hyatts - especially Grand Hyatts - supposed to have flat screen TVs soon?). My second room (actually checked out after one night but had to check back in due to continued bad weather) was in better shape but nothing special. The beds were comfortable in each room. Next gripe: cost of room service. A tuna sandwich, soup, and 2 small bottles of Diet Pepsi cost $63 including service, fees, etc. Even at NY prices (remember I live here) that's a rip off. Decor: Overall it's pretty icky - the lobby reminds me of an Atlantic city casino (not a good thing). I spent many nights in Hyatt hotels last year as a Diamond member.

The bathroom, as mentionend in other reviews, is absolutely the smallest bathroom I've ever seen in a GRAND Hyatt but due to the fact that one normally doesn't live in the bathroom, it was okay :-).

We only had the bedside lights, a small and useless desk light and something of a floor light which was everything else but not bright. I also missed a fridge or at least a minibar... and the advertised Ipod-thing-stereo was in every brochure but not on my desk...

It seems that housekeeping does just the rooms and nobody is responsible for the floors; especially leftovers (food) remained for hours (some for more than 24 hours) on the hallway.

I have taken many vacations and stayed in many hotels over the years, good and bad ones so I have learned some hard lessons and now before I travel and choose a hotel I do my research on sights such as this. I chose this hotels based on it's locations and reviews. I booked our hotel and flight together on Travelocity ($1000.00 for roundtrip airfair for 2 from Detroit, 2 nights hotel and transportation to and from airport ). Our room was an Executive Queen on the 21st floor. I could not believe how big this room was compared to other rooms in NYC, and the bathroom was not too small either. Could not hear the traffic or any noise from the street. Maid service was great. We ate in the hotel restaruant for dinner one evening and ordered calamari and lambchops. Some of the best lambchops weve ever had. Just disappointed because the dinner took an extra long time to come out and we had a show to catch. We let our waiter know our concerns about our time and he apologized letting us know he would take care of us. The manager came over and comped the entire bill for us. Then when we woke up the next morning there was an envelope slipped under our door with 2 vouchers that would comp us for breakfast in their restaurant. (which was nice considering the breakfast buffet is almost 30.00). You can't beat the location of this hotel either. It is connected to Grand Central Station, lots of restaurants and shopping.

No magnifying mirror either, which is unusual and made putting on makeup difficult without my glasses. I would have thought the 26th floor was high enough not to suffer from traffic noise from 42nd st outside the window but I was wrong. The traffic noise was almost as loud as if we were standing outside in it. The window wasn't double-glazed so as well as noise it let in the cold, some mornings there was solid frost on the inside of the window. The room had a/c to heat it up but it was so noisy we could only use it when we were out to heat up the room. 2 electrical sockets in the room were faulty and we didn't report them as we soon learned housekeeping took hours. We requested a sewing kit, and gave up waiting after an hour. One morning we called at 9am to mention that there were room service trays from the night before in the corridoor, they were still there when we returned at 2pm (we called again) and 5pm! These weren't our trays but the smell in the corridoor wasn't pleasant. Housekeeping was very inconsistent, the number and quality of the towels varied every day. Hubby spilt tea on the sheets one morning but they weren't changed that day. The bathroom floor wasn't mopped once during our week, we watched the bootprints add up. The other negative is that the escalator from the lobby to street level broke on Sunday night and they didn't have it fixed until very late on Wednesday night (it was still broken at 7.30pm but working at 1am when we returned). The desk staff were very helpful and the concierge made great dinner recommendations. Complimentary newspapers were delivered to your door weekdays.

I got the room for $110.00 plus tax and fees On Priceline. It is a very good deal for this property but I do wonder how this hotel got the Grand Hyatt name. It's a nice hotel but nothing like the Hyatt Grand Campions or the Grand Hyatt on Kauai. I called a day earlier to request room 2235 based on an earlier review I read on [--]. Also I gave my Gold Hyatt passport number. The clerk was very kind and mentioned I would get points for incidentals only. There was no mention of Priceline I arrived at 10:30 AM for my two night stay and the clerk said Room 2235 was blocked for me but was not clean. I signed my folio were I saw the Priceline prepay price of $251.00. Again, Priceline was never mentioned. i was pleased with my bid after seeing the prepay price since my $110.00 bid came out to $266 that included tax and service charge for my two nights stay. The clerk offered to check me in and told me to place my luggage with the bellman. I was told to come back in a few hours. That was fine with me since I had plans to visit some friends. I returned at 9:30 PM and the clerk said my room was 2236. When I balked anf said I reserved 2235 she apologized and said an error must have occurred. I took 2235 and went to the large bank of elevators after picking up my luggage from the bell capitan. When I got to the room, which was across from the ice and soda machines, I opened the door to an unclean room. Back I went to the desk for a new room assignment. After a bit of going back and forth I got room 2335. That room was incredibly spacious with a sitting area, large king size bed, a walk in closet, and decent size tv. There was no mini-bar or coffee maker. Furniture blocks the bed from the sitting area and provides for spacious accomodations. I think the 35 - 41 rooms are some of the largest so I would recommend trying to get those. Remember the room may be large but the bathroom is small. Really, really small. Paramount small. You get a sink, toilet, and bathtub/shower. There is barely room to move around and forget about storing toiletries since there is no counter space, The Hyatt should be ashamed of the bathrooms. Products in the bathroom were not replished - half a shampoo bottle, no new soap, but its hard to complain if that was the worst of it all. I found the bed to be very comfortable, the tv full of enough channels, the sheets of good quality, and the towels abit thin. Finally, I got a NYTimes every day by my door. The negatives about this hotel: impersonal service thin bath towels no coffee maker no mini bar two dollar charge to store luggage ten dollar charge for wireless internet small,small, small bathroom there are many pluses my room was large it was quiet shower had good hot water and lots of pressure nice beds and comfortable pillows fast elevators good location - close to times square and in grand central station great price for NYC if you luck out like I did and land the $110 special on Priceline. I did not use the healthclub since this was such a busy trip for me nor did I use room service. There are plenty of deli's and things nearby and in Grand Central Station.

The tired theme continues throughout the hotel really, from the dented elevators to the chipped paintwork on the door of every room, to the antique shower in your room. You get the sense that this place used to be really nice, about 20 years ago, but no one can be bothered to even give it a lick of paint. For Hyatt Hotels this surely must be a flagship - I mean it's their huge hotel in NYC, but they've seemingly forgotten about it. Staff are friendly, the room was much much bigger than expected (and bathroom much smaller), the room decor is OK and the bed extremely comfortable. However the room temperature controls didn't work and there were a few things missing - room service menu, tea/coffee maker, mini-bar. A bit odd for this class of hotel. Oh and the hotel bar closes at 1am. Location is the best thing - you're right in the middle of where you want to be, but then again there are a number of large hotels in NYC that can boast that.

The lighting was terrible, the only lights in the room were the 2 bedside lamps and a paper-covered lantern in the corner of the sitting area.

There's no coffee pot in the room but there is a kiosk downstairs where you can get free coffee or tea in the morning. Our room didn't have any literature on hotel amenities, NYC events, etc., not even a room service menu.

I used the fitness center a few times and it again ticked all the right buttons, with the exception of only having one conventional cycling machine, yet lots of treadmills, although would advise against going at very early each day as that tended to be when the middle-aged guests were there taking up all the equipment. Biggest problem was with the trust concerning housekeeping, where my girlfriend had bought some clothing, the bag had fallen on the floor and we had forgotton to pick it up, and cutting a long story short it went missing from the room, we eventually recieved the money for the item, but had to work harder than we should have, having been offered vouchers for food in the hotel, yet we had eaten and it was our last night.

The city is like no other in the world, and neither are the hotels because the cost of real estate is so high. (Want sunken tubs? Try Vegas or the Poconos, bathrooms in NYC are functional and meant for business.) For posh decor and design with a touch of luxury, then 5* hotels are for you. They include The Ritz Carlton, Trump Tower, Mandarin Oriental, and arguably The Palace and Four Seasons. There are several 4* showhorse hotels that wannabe 5* so they try hard. They include The Intercontinental the Barclay, the Michelangelo, The Carlton, and The Plaza Athenee. Then there are the 4* workhorse hotels. The ones designed for business travelers looking for a nice place to stay in New York convenient to transportation and featuring business amenities. The most well known of these are the Sofitel and NY Hilton and Towers. But The Grand Hyatt is another. I like, I mean Sally Field reaaally like, the Grand Hyatt. Because it is geared towards business travel, weekends are often discounted. And I love a bargain. We were able to snag two rooms on the very busy 12/9/06 \"blackout\" weekend for $200 a room. We checked in at 10:30 a.m. That's correct, a.m.! We got two rooms with king beds. Very clean, very comfortable. The rooms look exactly like the photos on the hotel's Web site. Despite the hotel being very full, we never heard a peep all night. And the bed was almost too comfortable to leave. If you want a posh-type hotel this would not be for you.

So I tried Priceline - and named an offer for four star hotels at $250/night (this same offer did not work earlier that month - but I thought I'd try it anyway) and it was accepted by the Grand Hyatt. We were so happy to be paying less than our budget hotel and to be bed bug free. The location was awesome. It's right beside Grand Central which made getting to places sooo easy. We took the subway to and from dinner and down to Soho for shopping. The valet service was easy getting in and out - although pricey at almost $50 per night. We requested a non-smoking room in a quiet location. They put us near the end of the hall on the 26th floor - and it was quiet as promised. We didn't hear any street noise or anything which is amazing for New York. We had two double beds and the room was perfect for two people - but the size of the bathroom and the room would probably be uncomfortable for more than two (which I assume was the case for some of the reviewers on this site). Everything was very clean in the room although the hallway carpet was sort of dingy. Our only complaint about the room is that the heat/air unit was pretty weak - we turned the thermostat down to 49 trying to get it to pump some cool air - but ended up having to open the window to cool it down. If your feet cannot take you any further at night - do like we did and eat at the bar at the Commodore Grill in the hotel one night. Although very expensive ($20 for a burger) - the bar staff was very friendly and full of useful information.

Having spent 2 weeks prior in fantastic hotels on the west coast we were looking forward to staying at the Hyatt (which was about 3 times the price as any other hotel we'd been in). At first sight the Hyatt is impressive with a busy lobby full of christmas decorations however this luxury was not reflected in the rooms. Firstly, we arrived in the early hours of the morning due to a cancelled flight - I rang them to let them know that we would be this late. When we checked into our double room we found ourselves in a twin room - not so good for a honeymoon couple! I rang reception to ask if we could change to a room with a larger bed and were told they would ring us back - which they didn't. I went down to the lobby to ask and was told there was no further availability but to check again in the morning. When I went back to the room we realised we were also in a smoking room, despite all of our booking information requesting a non-smoking room. In the morning I requested a room change and was given another room - this time it was non-smoking but was still a twin. The rooms have minimal amenities (i.e. A TV, a closet, a safe, some toiletries) and there was mould in the bathroom, ingrained dirt in the tiny bath, and loose light fittings in the bedroom (see photos). We paid an awful lot of money to stay at this hotel (over \u00a3300 per night) and, whilst I am aware a good proportion of that money was because it was New York and it was Christmastime, I still think that the price was extortionate for what amounted to a room which wouldn't look out of place in a cheap B&B (and there are a lot of hotels available in New York for the same price which would have been far better value for money). On the plus side, most of the staff were reasonably friendly and knowledgeable, the location is fairly good for shopping etc, and there is a shuttle bus which goes from a stop just outside Grand Central to JFK airport every 20 minutes. I think the Hyatt is in real need of a makeover and it would be nice if they spent as much attention on their rooms as they do on their lobby - having said that, the hotel was very busy so I guess they don't really feel like they need to make the effort.

As like a lot of reviewers I began to wonder if this place would be a mistake, but was very relieved to find it to be a great place to stay. The lobby is magnificent with a beautiful granite waterfall greeting you upon entering the hotel. Very upscale and perfectly decorated. Check-in was a breeze, even with our Trainee Desk Clerk, who was very polite and efficient. We stayed in a Lexington Suite which we booked directly on the hotel's website for $329 per night under the Senior Citizen Discount rate. Our room was 2550 and I would highly recommend requesting this room, or similar number, if you love a quiet room. This is it! During our four night stay we only hear noise two nights and those were sirens one evening and some type of beeping noise from a truck backing up on the street below. Other than that the windows did an excellent job soundproofing the room. We didn't hear street noise but as soon as the windows were openend you could really appreciate how quiet the room was with them shut. I really was amazed and had expected to be kept awake with street noise. Pleasant surprise! Lexington Suite has two seperate rooms. One sitting room which was on the small side, but held a loveseat sofa, table, desk with nice ergonomic desk chair, dresser, and flat screen TV. The closet was in this room as well. A small hall lead to the bedroom which was located far away enough from the room entrance that we heard absolutely no noise from the hall which was another plus. The bedroom had a wonderfully comfortable King size bed, two granite nightstands, a chair with ottoman, another dresser with a flat screen TV. The suite decor was very stylish and up-to-date. Carpet looked new as did the bedding and furniture. My only small complaint was the lighting as there really was no good reading light in the evening from the lamps in the room, other than lying in the bed. However, we came in late enough each evening that all we did was crawl into bed. As stated hundreds of times the bathroom is small. Smaller than any bathroom I've had on a cruise ship, and that's telling you something if you know what that's like. The shower was decent sized and tiled with trendy granite slabs. The sink was also granite. There is basically no room on the vanity, however, but there are wall mounted shelves to use. I just took all the toiletries off the wall shelves and then used the shelves for our toiletries instead which worked fine. Housekeeping could use a bit more training as the toilet wasn't cleaned two different days and I don't think the floor was ever mopped while we were there. One day the maid took all the supplied toiletries from the room and didn't replace them. If anything the bathrooms should always be cleaned completely every day as that tends to disgust me if not done. Otherwise the room itself was clean and comfortable. And like other reviewers I will say that the location is superb. Room service prices will make you laugh, if not from shock at the prices. Basic breakfast items priced well over $20. There are all kinds of small cafe type and deli type places to grab something to eat at a fraction of the cost. We found an excellent place called the Grand Cafe in a tunnel between 45th and 46th, between Vanderbilt and Lexington. Excellent made to order omelettes and other items, all priced under $4. You can't beat it and the food is terrific! Great coffee, too. Doormen were a big help getting cabs especially during rush hour. Just flash a couple of bucks and they'll work hard for you to get you on your way. Big tip - if you're going to a show reserve a restaurant near the venue. Trying to get a cab between 7 and 8 p.m. is impossible as everyone is heading to the theater. We found out the hard way our first night and almost missed our show. Eat by the venue and then you don't have to worry about cabbing it. Just walk! Bottom line is book on the hotel's website, use the Senior Discount if you can and spend a little extra for a Lexington Suite, prepare for the tiniest bathroom you could imagine and then you won't be disappointed.

Staff at concierge were polite and very efficient, they could not of been any more helpfull. In fact my only gripe is that they charged us $2 a bag when we needed to leave our bags as we had a late flight home. Surely a hotel of this quality could provide this service gratis?

Although there were two windows, due to the room looking over a courtyard/alley, there was very little natural light in the room, and the old, dull decor further assisted in making the room very dingy. The staff didn't respond to our numerous requests for maintenance assistance either. It is also a very loud hotel. We were woken up numerous times on several nights at 2/3am when groups of people returned to their rooms shouting loudly in the hall ways.

We walked out the front door and headed just a short walk back to Grand Central Station where we bought 7 day passes ($24.00) called the Metro Card. We were all over the city all week and when we stayed out a little too late to catch the Shuttle subway betwen Times Square and Grand Central (service ends at midnight for this line) a cab was easy to find and cheap ($5.00). A cab to the theater district was also only $10.00, we saw \"Wicked\" at the Gerschwin. Our only disappointment with the hotel was the Concierge service. The staff member was not at all friendly but merely perfunctionary . Play tickets and tours were handled by a separate company in the lobby. They only staffed one person and no-one while that person went to lunch. We did buy play tickets here and were glad that the tickets were capped at $199 as they were going for $250 on Ticketmaster.

Every morning when we opened the door, the New York Times was at our door. This saved us a trip to go and buy a newspaper. Our check in staff was very helpful and polite. The only rude person was the gentleman who was supposed to open the door for the handicap guest who never seem to move an inch when this lady was trying to get in. My husband and I had to open the door for her. The hotel is a little far (about four to five long blocks) from everything, Times Sqaure, Rockefeller, etc. It is close to the Grand Central Station which is right next door.

We booked 2 rooms directly through the Hyatt web site. We specifically booked rooms with 2 double beds and requested non smoking rooms in a quiet location. When we arrived we were told that our room type was not available and that we would have to go into rooms with a single king size bed. This was a bit annoying especially as the web site lists the rooms separately when you are making your booking. We were then provided with rollaway beds which took up a fair amount or space in the rooms. When we got to our rooms one of the rooms had a very strong smell of smoke so we had to move. The rooms themselves are very large with a seating area, and desk. Given the size of the room the bathrooms are surprisingly small. The sink unit in particular is very small with very little room to lay your stuff down on. Breakfast was pretty expensive so we went out . The Fitzpatrick Grand Central Hotel is only a couple of minutes away from the Hyatt and provides an excellent full irish breakfast for $15. Be warned that Grand Central station is currently being renovated. Our room on the 17th floor looked out onto the side of the station. On the first night of our stay they were sandblasting the building until 3.00am, so much for the quiet room ! Luckily as it was a holiday weekend they did not work for the remainder of our stay... Being close to Grand Central proved to be useful as the station has a really nice market selling fresh produce and gourmet foods, lots of shops, and a nice dining concourse. The Grand Hyatt is a very large impersonal hotel but it's location cannot be faulted and the rooms are large.", "Date": "June 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Experience\u201d", "Author": "BeingGreen", "ReviewID": "UR5233746", "Content": "I just returned from a five-night stay in this hotel and would highly recommend it. I read all the reviews on this site before making this my destination for a recent trip. The room was much bigger than I expected it to be (28th floor--king non-smoking). In addition to the bed and two nightstands inthe room, there was a desk with chair, an additional fabric covered chair and ottoman, a television atop a wooden bureau containing drawers, shelves, and a safe. The closet was long and narrow and the bathroom contained a tubwith shower, a single sink and wall shelving to hold makeup, lotions, etc. There was also a wall-mounted hair dryer in the bathroom. There were three or four elevators serving the floor and I rarely had to wait to go up or down. There was a single window in the room and it opened and had some sort of shading so that you could not see into the room from the other rooms making it possible to keep the shades up and the window open but still maintain privacy. The window ledge held an ice bucket and a large red vase. There were two phones--one by the bed and another on the desk--and a clock-radio CD player. The decor was khaki and white with black--very smoothing and certainly pleasant. I had room service on several occasions and found it very overly priced even for New York standards--$23 for pancakes that I could buy for less than $4 at the Grand Central Station food court. The room service menu lists a three-egg omelette for $23 and I ordered it for breakfast one day. I knew when I signed the bill that the total was much higher than I expected and I assumed I had mis-read the menu and there was a per charge fee for ingredients. I decided to check the menu and saw that there was no such fee so I decided to eat and then call to complain. That was when i realized they had sent up three omelettes and charged me for three!!! I called room service and told them that when i read \"three egg omelette\" off of the menu I was placing an order for a single omelette with three eggs not THREE OMELETTEs. They removed the charge and were very gracious about it. Another time they left the toast off of my order but they quicky sent it up when I complained. All in all while the price was very high, the food was good and it was worth the splurge on those days when i wanted to get ready to go out and yet do so in a leisurely fashion. I ordered a B and B one night and the person did not know what that was and asked me if I wanted a bread and butter plate. The girl who delivered the drink later told me that the guy who took my call did not drink and had never heard of a B and B, but that even the bartender said he had only had requests for two or three ever-- I did not expect the request to merit such discussion! When I returned each day the housekeeping staff did a great job of cleaning the room. In other visits when I have used the blanket kept in the closet or shelf of most hotel rooms the staff has returned it to the closet or shelf each evening requiring that I pull it out and re-do the bed, but at this hotel they made up the bed each day with the blanket--something I greatly appreciated and I had also removed the heavier bed covering which they left off of the bed as well. I appreciated this attention to detail. The hotel was quiet except for the last night when a large group of college students stayed on the floor and were up and down the halls. I could hear them each time they talked as they walked by my door, but never heard any noises from the adjoining rooms and very little street noise when i closed the window. There are vending machines on every floor--two dollar sodas. The great thing about this hotel is that you can get to the subway without going outside so it is very convenient to getting where you need to go. There is a great market in Grand Central station with lots of pre-made food so if you want to take it easy and eat in the room you can find every sort of take-out food from the market that is ready to eat. Likewise, there are great choices in the food court of the station. I found that most of the places there would prepare food for take-out as well. The concierge was great about locating movies and tickets and providing advice on the fastest most economical way to maneuver the city. The bell staff is less helpful. When I needed a taxi to leave they were so busy talkig to each other that I ended up hailing thre cab myself. When i arrived at the hotel no one moved to assist me with my bags. I would have gladly paid a tip to have assistance especially since upon entering the lobby one must go up an escalator or stairs to reach the registration desk. All in all, I would choose this hotel again.

I felt a need to use the free safe provided as the Mexican and Porto Rican cleaners looked a bit dodgy.

I was given my room number and when we checked in, it took all of three minutes to get the keys and find that indeed our request had been honored. The front desk was very friendly and helpful. We asked a maintenance man to point out where the walkway to Grand Central was and he physically walked us over there so we knew exactly where it was. The room was perfect.

But in the nooks, crannies and behind the easy chair lots of fluff, dust and half-chewed childrens candy! Couldn't have been vacuumed for ages. Bathroom was good and clean - washstand is kind of small, but the towels were nice and fluffy. Plenty of hot water. Housekeeping was OK, but with a different lady on duty on alternate days. One was physically so small she wasn't able to reach the bathroom shelf to put new face cloths, so on her duty days we didn't get any! Bed-making techniques varied between the ladies, one gave us sheets so tightly tucked in it hurt your toes, the other made it so loose that everything rolled off the bed within minutes of getting in! Good size TV in the room with plenty of channels and pay movies. The room has a window that we could actually open and there is easy access to the room climate controller. Disappointingly there was no coffee/tea making facility or an in-room fridge (mini-bar). Two telephones. Don't know about internet access. The lobby was busy all the time we were there - several conferences and meetings on going. We had breakfast once in the restaurant - comprehensive buffet style but expensive (about $30 each). We bought our breakfasts from the Dining Concourse at Grand Central and brought them back to the room. At checkout the bill is slid under the door the night before. Checkout can be done via the TV or in the lobby at the desk or by computer terminal. Very efficient. For a limo to the airport see the Taxi Captain at the front door (the guy with the biggest hat!) - he fixed a price of $60 + tunnel toll + tip to JFK.

When it was returned to me, the back quarter panel was smashed ($1300 damage.) The parking attendants insisted I brought the car in that way. I sought the hotel manager who told me the hotel wasn't responsible, parking is handled by an independent company. The company insisted we did the damage. No one was interested in this problem. We had a paid reciept showing THE GRAND HYATT NY was paid for this service, not another company. My husband wouldn't lie down and eventually (2 months later) the hotel reimbursed us the $1300. I felt they (albeit after a lot of phone calls and pushing) did o.k. by us. Went again Aug 05 and had no problems. The last visit we had the same issue with the bedding. Four of us arrived and we were given a king room. I insisted at the front desk and was told there were no doubles to be had. I ended up paying for a second room so we could sleep comfortably. This hotel doesn't guarantee bed type. It turned out this past weekend that all the double rooms had been booked in Oct for some dance recital/workshop. Why they continued to take reservations for a double room is beyond my understanding, but they did. The cost was pushed onto me and my family. They did nothing to help defer it. In fact, they suggested if cost and a double room was an issue, that I stay in Jersey City. Give me a break and give me a real solution!!! My final conclusion, after multiple stays in this hotel, is that they're tightening their belt, taking in all the cash they can and they've implemented some shady practices. As far as the room itself goes,it could have been cleaner but it was fine. I'm sorry that I didn't take a picture of the cot so I could post it here.

The doorman greeted us, took our bags, and directed us towards the front desk. He informed us that check in was at 3PM, but we could always try and see if there was anything available. Luckily, there was a clean + vacant room ready for us.

Our request for a king bed was accomodated, but our request for a view was not. Not a biggie, though. We were just happy to have a room at 8AM so we could nap. The room itself was big enough for the two of us-- there was a desk (with phone), a TV center (below the TV was a armoire with drawers and a small safe), a chaise, a closet, full bath (vanity/sink area was a little small), 2 nightstands (each with a lamp, one with a phone), and of course, the bed. I found the bed to be quite comfy-- my boyfriend thought it was too hard. The computerized wake-up calls were always on time and reliable.

My boyfriend ate breakfast in the hotel once (at the Sky Bar). If I remember correctly, the breakfast was a buffet with 3 price ranges: $15 for pastries, milk, juice, etc. $18 for the stuff previoulsy mentioned plus a little extra (continental breakfast). $25 for omelet station, cereal, oatmeal? Not sure on the details. I wasn't in the mood to spend $15 for a croissant and muffin, so I headed down to Grand Central Terminal's food court and grabbed a quick bite to eat there. Odd thing about the Sky Bar-- with a name like that, one would think that it would be on a high hotel floor and... be a bar, correct? Nope, it closed everyday at 2PM and was on the 2nd floor. I was looking forward to having a place to get a few drinks with a nice view-- unfortunately, the Sky Bar was not the place. We did get a few drinks in at the bar for Commodore Grill, the hotel's full service restaurant. Drinks were a little steep ($11 for Baileys on the rocks, $11 for vodka tonic [Absolut], and $8 for a pint of Guinness), but nothing out of the ordinary for a hotel bar. Our bartender was nice and we talked baseball for a bit (He was a Yankees fan, we rubbed in how the Angels kicked their butts). The hotel operators need to cheer up a bit-- or at least pretend that they don't hate their jobs when they take a call. No one would help us print out boarding passes for our flight (Concierge + the Business Center were closed, but alternatives were not given to us at all), the Mailroom wanted to charge me $0.49 to mail out ONE postcard... domestically! They claimed that there was a \"seasonal\" rate of $0.44/postcard... plus, since they had to \"run it through their machine\" a $0.05/postcard fee would be charged as well. I just walked to a nearby store, bought some stamps, applied them to my cards, and dropped them into a mailbox. The morning of check-out, we had a $353 charge for room service... something that we didn't order. Upon further investigation, the Front Desk adjusted off the fee. My boyfriend was charged $1/half-minute for internet services in the Business Center, but at least we got our boarding passes taken care of before we got to the airport. Overall, the hotel was OK. It was in a good location (connected to Grand Central Station), the lobby was nice, and most of the staff was nice as well.

Reading through the reviews with Trip Advisor we were impressed with what we read about the Grand Hyatt. I made contact with one of the Managers before our arrival and requested a high floor and large adjoining rooms. We were not disappointed... we were placed on the 28th floor and our rooms were really very spacious.[From what I read this is unusual for NY] We found the staff helpful, the lobby was beautifully dressed for the occasion and our Christmas dinner was as traditional as you wanted. It is perfectly situated with access to Central Station within the building, offering shopping and a wide variety of restaurants. 5th Ave and so much more is just a short stroll away. There were only two negative points; 1. We had requested two beds and a roll-out in the childrens room... there was a king bed there on arrival but they did provide a roll-out for our daughter on request and the king bed was big enough to accommodate the two boys. [The room was so large there was no problem adding the extra bed] 2. The Sky Bar, which they advertise in a big way was not open during our stay.

Trains, Subway, Taxis, Airport shuttle, busses all terminate at the station. It's central geographic location in Midtown is perfect for Times Square, Empire State, Maceys, And the newly opened Top of the Rock at the Rockerfeller Centre.

Concierge was excellent and directed us to a superb pizza place. Bell hops were a bit up themselves and almost grabbed your bags and held them to ransome for a tip! I'm English and I did not like that! Stuff was going off over new year and one of the bars seemed to be closed for private partys for our entire stay. I thought that this was a bit off for a 5 star hotel and would have liked to have a drink overlooking 42nd street just once during my 4 day stay. A wedding on closed the bar again on new years eve, even though it seemed to be empty for the whole evening. we failed to get into Times Square and resorted to the back bar for a few drinks and had to suffer the lack of seats, dark environment and very high prices. OK for one drink but not good for 5 hours! Room was smallish, but excellent. We stayed on the 25th floor and it was very quiet. Nice bath/shower combo and marble tiles. HVAC was a pain, we had to set it at 40 degrees or it cooked you. We even had to open a window one night. Massive TV, good phone system, NY Times every morning. Everything was spotless, except the lobby toilets that really needed a clean, especially after new year. Did not eat in the hotel as the prices are steep!

Very convenient to subway at Grand Central Station. Good selection of restaurants within easy walking distance including those in the terminal itself. Room: Very good. Spacious by NYC standards, clean, and comfortable. Wireless T-Mobile internet was a big plus for me. The bath was a reasonable size although counterspace was limited. We were on the 29th floor and there was no real view out the functional windows. Heat/Air worked fine - no complaints. Common areas/lobby: The lobby is large and attractive with waterfall and various seating areas. There are two bars, one of which was closed during most if not all of our trip. There is also a restaurant. We enjoyed our one meal there and frequented the bar on most evenings as well. They offer a good selection of draft beers but be prepared for NYC pricing here - $7 to $8 per beer. Service: No issues. We were checked in and out without difficulty or delay even considering that were we there during the week before Christmas and during the transit strike. Management offered daily updates on the strike with our complimentary copy of the NY Times. Overall: For the amount we were able to book this trip (major internet travel website), the hotel was an outstanding bargain. I have paid almost three times the amount and was less satisfied.

The smell of smoke was ingrained in the carpet, bedding, wallpaper, & furniture. We were told someone would be up to \"freshen up\" the room when we checked in, 2 hours later after 2 phone calls, housekeeping finally arrived. She did change our entire bedding which allowed us to be able to sleep on the bed, but we slept with the windows open the entire night listening to the horns & sirens of NYC in order to breathe. After calling to complain again about how bad the room was, they gave us $100 off the room. I cannot have imagined paying $400 for that room - we would have been better off in a Motel 6. The following day, we were moved as promised, but only after 2 phone calls & persistence. To their credit, we were moved to a very nice room on the 31st floor (the regency club level) & received wine & cheese that night in our room.

To begin with, we had booked a package which included breakfast, and had requested a high non-smoking room with a view. Everything was fine so far.. we were given a room on the 21st floor (which I thought was high enough), but noticed the trip on the lift was rather short. It was then I realised the hotel had the Lobby, Conference Room, 16th floor, 17th... 21st. In the end.. we were no higher than the 10th floor. As we walked into the room, we found out the room stinked out to the scent of cigarettes, and that our view was.. well.. there was NO view. If we opened the curtains, we would see another guest. The concierge (Mr. Jason) was useless. We were about to leave the hotel. Next morning, we went to have our breakfast. Unfortunatelly, we found out the hotel had 80 seats for about 500 people trying to get breakfast (which was just OK). After waiting for about 35 minutes and answered what room we were staying at, we got a table, and enjoyed the breakfast. But as we were about to leave, we got haulted by hotel security for trying to leave without paying. As I tried to explain the maitre'd we had breakfast included, he kept yelling at me in front of almost 150 people... so it became a yelling contest. I won :) and got him call the front desk, and his apologies, which I rejected. I was asked to get the beakfast vouchers (2005, and they cannot use computers). At night, as we returned to the hotel, my finace'e went to the front desk to get the vouchers to avoid a scene the next day, as I got to our room. It was not after 15 minutes when she arrived at our room crying, as she was accused of \"taking advantage of the Hotel and claiming for more vouchers than you are (we were) supposed to have\", out loud (looks like hotel's policy to yell). This was the 2nd. time in 14 hours the hotel had accused us of thieves. I got dressed, got to the front desk, and asked for the manager. Guess what? THAT was the manager. I asked him to provide me with the name of the person who he alleged had given us the vouchers, and to show me the voucher numbers, my signature receiving them or any document. As he was making SUCH SERIOUS ACCUSATIONS, I would have guessed he would have had AT LEAST one proof. To your surprise, he did not. After about ten minutes, he said he would \"make an exception\" and give us the vouchers, to which I replied there was no exception to be made as this was the first time the vouchers were being handled to us; he would just be doing his job. In the end, we stayed at a lousy room, with no view, the service (or lack of it) of a $10 hotel, a totaly incompetent staff, and a flash light that came from the fire alarm that blinked every 4 hours (strong enough to wake you up). Two great things were the bed, and the location... but I'd much rather stay in many other hotels for the same price than returning here... no wonder they are ranked 167 in tripadvisor... PS: on our return, I wrote an email to the Hyatt Customer Affairs and Hyatt Quality, which was replied by the hotel's Assistant Rooms Executive who stated: \"we believe that there was no disrespect intended by any of our employees\".

After reading the reviews on here I was a little worried about my stay, but my fears were alleviated quickly. I was very satisfied with my entire stay at the Hyatt. First off, the location is second to none. You are adjacent to the Grand Central Terminal. So what, you say? Well, the 4, 5, 6, 7, and S subway lines are about a 5 minute walk from the hotel lobby through completely indoor corridors, bypassing a couple of coffee shops, bakeries, and newstands on the way for added convenience. Very nice to have, especially in the morning, and especially when its raining outside. From the hotel lobby, you can be in Times Square in 10 minutes, and in lower Manhattan in about 20 minutes. If you'd rather take a cab, there was always an employee ready to hail a cab for you right in front. I never waited more than 5 minutes for one. Another positive - the rooms had been recently renovated as the Hyatt website mentions. My room had a king size bed, large TV, trendy furnishings, and plenty of space considering it was a Manhattan hotel room. Unlike other reviewers have mentioned, housekeeping did a great job on my room - left it in great shape every afternoon when I returned from sight-seeing. Even though I booked the room through Priceline, I felt like I was treated like a Hyatt club member through my entire stay, right down to getting a copy of the New York Times every morning. The only negative I can think of is the lobby was always mobbed with people. This is a HUGE hotel and there were lots of conventions going on the weekend I was staying. However, on my floor (17th), it was very quiet and I never encountered a noise problem from the street, from the lobby, or from other patrons. Another negative is the hotel charges for internet use: 50 cents a minute. I guess I didn't get the most \"one-on-one\" service I've ever gotten in a hotel but in all honesty I never needed it because my stay was so great. This hotel deserves to be ranked MUCH higher than the #165 rating it has commanded on Tripadvisor. Top 100 for sure - possibly even the Top 50 when you consider some of the other hotels that are ranked there. Granted, I wouldn't pay Hyatt's normal room rate of $400/night to stay here. But $210/night rate through Priceline was a very reasonable for a stay in this type of hotel in NYC in peak season.

Direct access to Grand Central Terminal puts the subway and trains just a few minutes away. This is important because catching a taxi on 42nd street is difficult because the street is gridlocked all hours of the day. We sat in our taxi on the way to the hotel for 15 minutes while just 1 1/2 blocks from the hotel. Go up the escalator from the lobby to the Lexington Street exit where the taxis are plentiful and actually move. We had a nice large corner room that was clean, quiet, and comfortable for the most part. We had a walk-in closet with enough hangars for both my wife and I to hang a week's worth of clothing. The lighting was not the best so I had to sit by the window to get sufficient light to read. The TV was fixed on a dresser--it did not swivel--so we couldn't watch TV from the bed, only from the one chair, plus a hard desk chair. The small bathroom lacked the usual amenities that a Hyatt typically offers and each day the housekeepers forgot to replenish at least one item: one day all three hand towels were missing, the next no new soap, no wash clothes, etc. All of these are small irritants but they do make you wonder about the place. Two other annoyances that bothered us: (1) There is a nice coffee kiosk in the lobby for those who want a quick cup and a pastry. We found out when talking with others that guests were given coupons when checking in for a free cup of coffee. We did not get any and marched down to the frontdesk to ask why. No reason was given, just a shrug of the shoulders, but two coupons were offered.

We did go to their other lounge--at the Commodore Grill--which was fine, but our best find was the outdoor lounge of Michaels Jordan's restaurant at Grand Central Terminal which has half-price drinks for several hours. The food is pretty good too. The staff at the Hyatt are nice, but clearly harrassed.

However, my safe was also locked and I had to call Security to open it for me so that I could use it. When the security man arrived, he saw the burn and asked me what I did very accusingly and rudely. I told him I had been at the hotel for less than ten minutes and it was a sign of poor maintenance by the hotel and he should report it so that he problem could be fixed while I was working on Tuesday. No one ever came to fix it, communicate to me about the problem, etc. This, after a hotel employee accused me of burning the rug. I was just a faceless guest and I had no time to waste at the front desk, etc. On my final night (5th night), I had a voice mail from a desk clerk calling me by the name of another guest asking if my room was OK. As I was checking out in less than 8 hours, I did not bother to return her call. I liked the voice mail checkout as whenever I am in NY, I take an early flight out and the cashiers are never ready in any hotel for me. Odd - no mini bars.

I felt very safe in this hotel, it's in a great area - so convenient as it's right next to Grand Central Station, shopping and Broadway- and there were hotel staff waiting at the door every night making sure hotel guests were the only ones coming into the hotel. The staff was very professional and friendly, we bought theatre tickets through the hotel, which was so convenient and we ended up with front row, mezzanine seats the day of a Saturday show.

They would not transfer us to another room, even though other floors had hot water. Finally, they said that we could come downstairs (22 stories), pick up a key to shower in another room and then return the key afterwards. Furthermore, then next morning, they wanted us to do the same procedure; rather than switching rooms or keeping the extra key. When we checked out that day at around noon - they offered us breakfast coupons at the hotel restaurant, even though breakfast was over and we were checking out. Finally, they gave us a $125 credit.

As some reviewer mentioned the fire alarm on 25.09. at 3.15 am: Yes there was an alarm and it wasn`t very nice to be woken up at that time. But in my opinion it`s better to once have an alarm where there`s no fire as no alarm when there`s one. Safety is extremly important, especially in such a large building.

Being a Hyatt Platinum Passport member I can honestly say that this is by far the worst Hyatt facility I have ever stayed in! This is by no means a four star facility. I had requested early check-in and a renovated room, which I was assurred had been set aside. Needless to say, upon arrival I had to wait until late in the afternoon to get my room, which was not renovated and looked like it had been decorated back in the 60's. Their Regency Club level was closed for remodeling, which they did not reveal at the time of booking. The room was very used in appearance, and housekeeping was spotty. The reception on the majority of the channels was unwatchable, and forget depending on a wake up call. Temperature controls are their obviously for decorative purposes only. Service at the desk was surly and an attitude in general of \"who cares\" was what they felt was proper service. To apologize for the inconvenience I was given some coupons for Starbucks.

This is a small thing but it always annoys me if a shower does not have a shelf or somewhere to store your shampoo or shower gel, needless to say my shower gel remained on the floor. The staff was friendly, which made the experience a lot better. FOOD: Room service is outrageous. A bowl of cereal for $8!!!! I think the hotel has a deal with the local restaurants and they kept recommending a bar down the street, which was okay but you will have better luck finding food on your own.
