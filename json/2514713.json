We are meticulous about making sure to book rooms with two beds or we don't book at all. So I'm sure you can see where this is going. We showed the check-in staff our exact paper that specified our room was to have two separate beds. We were told there were none available. The staff, however, was very accommodating and told us they could get us a roll-away and then upgrade us to a Suite. Fine, I'll rough it for one night. So we head up to the room after being told the roll-away is on it's way. 30 minutes pass, nothing. We call back. Another 30 minutes pass, nothing. Only upon the third call (1:30AM) do we finally get a roll away. We sleep. So the next night we go to the front desk to get keys to our suite. \"OK, now this suite is going to have two beds?\" \"Oh well, it has a couch that turns into a bed. Yeah, but I didn't pay $300 a night to sleep on the COUCH! \"This is a four level upgrade, I'm sure you will find it satisfactory.\" Ummmmmm...no, actually. I appreciate your effort and generosity on such a large upgrade, but if our problem is that our room has only a single bed, upgrading us to a nicer room with one bed doesn't solve the problem that needs to be solved! So that was that. We paid $300 a night for one of us to sleep on a hide-away bed for a week. Lame. The AC units in the rooms are useless and you're discouraged from opening the windows. It takes the strength of the Incredible Hulk to get them open anyway, at which point you're met with the loud buzzing of generators. The bathroom is the (only) highlight. Our suite had a fantastic tile walk-in shower. Shower head was high and heated up plenty fast. Sink was granite with plenty of space to put your stuff. The usual fare was provided. To cap off the trip, for some reason the very last night they decided to remake the sofa instead of just leaving the bed down. Around we went again. Called at 5:00, come back from dinner, no bed. Called at 7, nothing. Called again at 8...finally someone came to make the bed down. Common areas are beautiful (you have to sneak your way into some of the ballroooms) and I did feel for them, that has to be expensive to maintain, but that shouldn't fall on us.

The hotel is in need of a major overhaul, as it has not been properly maintained. They are in the process of renovations.

The lobby is beautiful and I love the history of the place. And I loved the feeling of getting in a cab and saying \"take me to the Waldorf.\" That said, a legendary luxury hotel should provide a spectacular experience, and this was not that. I was there two weeks. First, the good: - Gorgeous Art Deco style lobby - Beautiful marble bathroom with a medicine cabinet and under the sink cabinet, so there's plenty of toiletry space - Possibly the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in - Hotel staff was very friendly on check-in, upgrading me to a better room - Bellman was extremely helpful after I checked in, testing all the amenities of my room and showing me how they worked - iPod dock on nightstand - Helpful concierge - Plenty of hangers in the closet - Shades for the window so the room was nice and dark at night - Waiters in the Peacock Alley Bar were very friendly, if a little slow. (The bar itself is quite overpriced, but that's to be expected here. I paid $44 for a cheesecake slice and a Manhattan.) - Beautiful fitness center with great treadmills and free water and snacks, although I would have appreciated a squat machine as part of the weightlifting equipment - Good location with lots around The bad: - When I arrived, there was no doorman to help me with my luggage so I struggled with it up the marble stairs into the lobby. - I had someone stay with me for the weekend. I asked at the front desk to leave her a key to my room so she could come in before I was off work. I've had no problems doing this at other hotels. The front desk said they had to add her name to my reservation, which is fine but I've never seen another hotel do that. They took down the name, supposedly put it in their system, and then the next day they had no record of her. She had to call me and give the phone to the front desk to ask me questions and verify what was going on. - The rooms are shabby - paint chipping, water damage on ceiling that's been painted over, black scuff marks on wallpaper. - The towels and robes need an upgrade, or at least some fabric softener. Not horrible, but rough and on the thin side. - The minibar has no prices posted, but you'll be automatically charged for moving things. There's no space to put your own snacks or leftovers from dinner in it - there's a space where you could wedge things in, but it isn't cooled, as I discovered the hard way. - I had a bottle of wine that I left corked and half-full on the dresser. The next day, the cork was missing and half of what was left was gone. So apparently the housekeeping staff stole my wine and left it out to spoil. Nice. - The hotel guide says there's a charge for the fitness center, but nowhere is it posted how much. I luckily didn't get charged, but I don't know if this was a mistake, or if they've changed the policy, or if I got it free for some other reason. Regardless, they should clarify. - Wifi is $15 or so per device in-room. - Terrible channel selection - no Comedy Central to watch Jon Stewart, and I missed a March Madness game I really wanted to watch because the hotel didn't have the channel. - The Starbucks in the lobby charges a good $1.50 more than other locations for the same drink - save your money and go across the street to the one on Lex and 51st. I didn't have a bad experience at all, apart from the housekeeping staff stealing and spoiling my wine, but I wouldn't stay here again, especially on my own dime. I get better service and amenities for less in the Marriotts and regular Hiltons I've stayed at lately, so I'll be going back to them.

Checking in was carried out quite quickly, but we did time it right as there were long queues on some occasions.

Unless you are out to completely blow your budget, I would suggest you don't get anything out of the mini-bar ($17.50 for a minature whisky), don't pay for a movie ($18.50) and avoid room service (service was good, but again boy do you pay for it!!). I do think for the amount of money that the rooms cost, complimentary bottles of water should be offered. They cost nearly $9 from the mini-bar. We only ate a small meal in Peacock Alley, which was okay but again very expensive.

I have stayed in many 4 and 5 star hotels and while unable to fault them, once inside you could be in any big hotel anywhere in the world. Not so the Waldorf, you could not possibly be anywhere else!!.The lobby is magnificent and the rooms are so comfy and elegant none of your minimalist boutique-e chic here. We have upgraded to a suite on the last three visits and we feel like royalty.The service is faultless and the doormen and bell boys so smart in their uniforms. Oscars does a fab breakfast, yes it is pricey but you dont need to do it every morning. Ellens stardust diner and the Brooklyn diner both in Times square are cheap and full of atmosphere Normas ar the Parker Meridien is fantastic as well. A bit further afield is the Lexington candy s hop,a great place for a cheap brekkie. The bull and bear steakhouse at the Waldorf does the best steaks we have had but we really like Johnny Utah nr the Rockerfeller centre too and it is more reasonable. We always come home exhausted there is so much to do it would take too long to tell about eveything that makes what seems to be an annual event now for us, so fantastic but there is no doubt that each visit to the big apple makes us love it more and staying at the Waldorf is the icing on a huge,decadent cake.

It was our first time in New York and my husband booked this hotel and trip as a nice surprise for our short break. Having stayed at a few older but iconic hotels around the world, our expectations were not overly high for the room as we have found the rooms tend to be smaller and more worn than the new hotels. When we checked in we were surprised to see the room was of a decent size and well decorated and very clean. The bathroom was basic with plastic shower curtain holders and a toilet that kept blocking up - but nice smelling shampoo and soaps. Overall the room was ok. The size was good, it was clean and the bed was comfy but the small things were missing - no slippers, a threadbare robe that was ripped, no coffee maker (Starbucks was in the lobby but had very limited hours and room service was available but had a $5.25 charge on top of room service prices which would make a coffee around $13!!!!!) if you had the foresight of knowing that the hotel didn't supply coffee makers (which I didn't) you could have ordered one. I strongly recommend this if you are early risers or else it's either a long wait or an ouch in your wallet - either option is not really what you expect from this hotel. Also be aware that for the whole 3 days there was no Internet available in our room either. We saw a lot of people using the free Internet in the lobby which my husband ended up doing for business. There was no explanation for the lack of Internet - it just didn't work. The lobby and reception areas are beautiful to say the least and make this hotel. We ate breakfast at Oscar's once which was a buffet style and we had a bill of $90.25 inc tip - would not recommend this but one evening we had drinks, plates of cheeses and meats and a slice of cheesecake in The Peacock Alley - which was lovely and relaxed, excellent service and only around $130.

We did not experience any problems mentioned about noise on lower floors from the exterior refurbishment works, which I understand are nearly finished now. In our room however the window mounted ventilators were old and their controls tended to be difficult to manage, the old window blinds were frayed, and the shower took several attempts to keep the water hot.

I was so happy with every aspect of our trip with the glaring exception of the Waldorf Astoria. They are in need of a deep clean- not only in their rooms, hallways, public areas and entrances, but in their customer service departments. We were treated like a nuisance by the house keeping phone center when we dared to ask for linens for the pull out couch, or to be able to have the clock set to the right time (it's locked down tight for some ridiculous reason). When the linens finally did arrive (an hour later- and it was already 10:00 at night) there was no blanket included. And the housekeeping rep was so annoyed by having to come to our room to give us linens (\"I have to get back to work\"....?) that she actually asked if we \"really needed a blanket\"...No. It's January in NYC. We'll be warm and cozy in the 20 degree weather. The maintenance man who came to set the clock insisted on getting into some political arguement with me about the mayor of Chicago, which he initiated. Why? The worst thing that happened was that there was a function in the lobby on the Sunday of the weekend we were there. NO ONE alerted us to this. No phone message, no paper under the door, no sign in the lobby- NOTHING. When we returned to the hotel after a very long day of sight seeing we were blocked from going to the elevators of our room. Instead we were shuffled to some elevators in the bowels of the building (of which there were several but only one was actually working) along with 100 other guests. All to wait to get onto one elevator to get to our rooms. it took forever and would be infuriating at a budget road side hotel much less the WALDORF ASTORIA. When we complained to the front desk manager about the situation we got NO apology, NO remedy and NO compensation. Instead he handed us a coupon for a small coffee from Starbucks. Gee, thanks. He actually said \"Well, we told the people who checked in on Saturday.\" When we said \"What about those who checked in on Friday?\", he replied \"Oh, I guess we forgot.\" The beds were horrible, the carpet was dirty, the decor was trying desperately to reflect the history of the building but failed miserably.

Try somewhere else. The Walforf is a charming, iconic and generally lovely hotel, but it won't be for eveyone. The foyer looks as much like a Hotel Museum as a 21st Century hip, wireless accommodation experience, and we love that about it. The hotel is huge, so there is often a queue just to talk to someone at reception, even to collect a message. We were shocked and delighted at the rate we got for our 7 night stay at The Walforf. Our suite was beautiful.....then next morning we saw the workers immediately outside our window - and I do mean \"immediately.\" The Park Avenue facade is being upgraded, and suddenly the low rate was put into context. But it mattered not - there was no noise and no inconvenience. It was a delightful, warm and comfortable place to be. Bobby delivered our luggage and gave us the rundown - stop him talking if you can, the man is a human word machine - but listen to him, for his NY wisdom is invaluable. Internet is expensive by today's standards, but of course we signed on anyway. Just after we arrived, a pipe broke somewhere and the water system was shut down for the entire hotel - a reminder that the Waldorf wasn't built in the last 10 years. It came back on a couple of hours later. We had a drink at Sir Harry's (wonderful when it is quiet), buffet breakfast at Oscar's (extensive choices) and a nightcap at the Bull & Bear (the Cheescake and Red Velvet are to die for), Midtown location means that attracions like Grand Central Station, MoMA, even Central Park are within walking distance, and downtown life is (for us, not gerat subway users) a $12 cab ride away. As a genuine NY experience, staying at the Waldorf is right up there, and was a highlight of our time in this great city. I could on, as may have become obvious...we would and will stay at the Walforf again, if rates permit.

So this review is mostly my impressions, but a few from them as well. The bellhop promptly brought my bag up to my room, he was very kind and courteous. The room was small but clean, and the bed was nice with comfortable pillows and new linens. If you want to use more than outlet at a time, good luck! There was one outlet free in my room, then two more in the bathroom (I charged my laptop in the bathroom in desperation at one point). The closet was relatively small - enough for me but it might have been too small for two people, but there were plenty of hangers, a safe, and an iron and ironing board provided. The draft coming in from under the window was so strong that it blew the curtain and I had to set my thermostat at 80 degrees just to keep the room comfortable because it was FREEZING in there. Another colleague of mine of a different floor had the same problem. And we live in Chicago, we're used to cold weather but we prefer to keep it outdoors. Now, I like old buildings and I appreciate the history of them. But I feel like there is a difference between \"old building\" and \"poor maintenance.\" I think the hotel is somewhat coasting on their name at this point. They haven't complately let the place go, but they're not exactly holding it to the highest possible standard either. One important thing to note: the walls are paper thin. My room was near a supply closet for the hosuekeeping staff and I could hear everything they did in there, as well as their conversations. One colleague could hear a couple of his floor having very loud, athletic... couple time. He could hear it all the way down the hall coming from the elevator. So if you're a light sleeper, this may not be the place for you. Some male colleagues alerted me to the fact that late at night the lobby was, and I quote, \"crawling with professionals.\" Apparently they were propsitioned multiple times just trying to get to the elevator. The lobby was pretty busy at all times, day and night, probably because it had free WiFi. You have to pay for WiFi in your room unless you're a gold or platinum level HHonors member. $16 per day and it is painfully slow. If you have AT&T for your cell phone note that the 3G signal in the hotel is terrible (not the hotel's fault, obviously, but good to know). My lowly blue level HHonors membership did get me free bottled water out of the minibar, which was nice since as other have noted there was no room service and no vending machines. So definitely let the front desk know if you're a member, and if you're not you should join before you stay there. All in all I'd say the hotel was fine. Not excellent but not bad, and none of us came home with bed bugs.

First the positives, to be fair. The hotel is centrally located and it is easy to get anywhere in Manhattan. When checking in the staff was extremely helpful and welcoming and the concierge was very helpful on several occasions when we had questions. As a Hilton HHonors gold member we were also placed in a large corner room far away from the elevators and had free internet (membership certainly has it's privileges). The bed was extremely comfortable and there was plenty of closet space, with a standard closet for me and a walk-in closet for my girlfriend (perhaps this was due to it being a corner room). The bathroom was large and everything worked. Now for the negatives. While the Waldorf Astoria certainly has an old world charm, it is also a bit tired and in need of some updating. The elevators had some issues while we were there and it was difficult to get to our room on several occasions. The carpets in the hallways had certainly seen better days. Wallpaper was pealing in the hallways and it was rather shabby. Also, while the room and bathroom had individual temperature control, they were the type of radiators seen in the 1960s (either too hot or too cold and a bit loud). Again, as a Hilton HHonors gold member I qualify for free breakfast at other Hilton properties, but the \"breakfast\" at the Waldorf was supplied by the Starbucks downstairs and consisted of a coffee, a pastry, and a juice box. Now I realize I'm complaining about something that is given to me for free (poor me), but when other Hilton properties supply a relaxed breakfast in a restaurant setting, standing in line with 30 other people in a tiny Starbucks seems a bit chintzy. Also, there are no coffee or tea making facilities in the rooms, so you have to either order room service or go to Starbucks for this. I think that the Waldorf Astoria is coasting on its name and reputation, and I was definitely a bit disappointed. Why does it seem that the (supposedly) highest end hotels are the most stingy on the amenities? And finally for the theft. After I had checked out and was on a train to Washington DC I noticed that a beautiful Mont Blanc pen I had in my bag was mysteriously gone. The bag had never left my side during the trip, except when it was in my room. I certainly can not prove that it was stolen while at the Waldorf, but the facts are, 1) the pen was in my bag when I checked in, 2) the bag was only left unattended in my room, and 3) my pen is now gone. Apart from the alleged theft, however, my overall impression of the Waldorf Astoria in New York is that while it is in a great location and has a certain old world charm, the hotel, which is supposed to be one of the best in the Hilton chain, does not live up to this reputation. I think there are definitely better hotels for the money in New York and I would probably not stay at the Waldorf Astoria again unless some major changes are made.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBill Overcharge\u201d", "Author": "BAC922", "ReviewID": "UR123959655", "Content": "The hotel is old so when the water went out for a day, you work around it.

I spoke with customer care at Hilton, the parent company, who appears to be trying to take care of it, but given the lack of response at the hotel, it remains to be seen if they will actually correct the overcharge.

We were there for three days only and started relaxing immediately which I think was because of the lovely, homely, antique furniture and lamps that cast a warm glow.

We did not bother to ask at reception whether this was an oversight but we were concerned about walking barefoot on a carpet where grubby shoes may have been.

Admittedly, I am primarily a Hilton / Marriott business traveler. On a recent business trip to NYC however, I found that the hotels I was familiar with were all fully booked. Had Expedia not offered a \"head-turning\" rate on the Waldorf Astoria, I sincerely doubt I would have ever stayed at this property whether for \"business or pleasure.\" I fully enjoyed this property and the relentless pursuit of service demonstrated by their entire staff. My room was both elegant and comfortable. While an older landmark hotel, the bathroom was still spacious with wonderful lighting and I had no trouble establishing a Wi-Fi connection at my stylish desk. Many hotels lay claim to \"dream beds\" but the standard Waldorf Astoria pillows, sheets and mattress that I experienced were perfect in every way. While the check-in was quick and efficient and bell captain storage of my luggage for several hours was appreciated, it is the assistance of Graham at the Concierge desk that I will detail. I've always stayed in the Broadway area and had no knowledge of Park Ave area restaurants for a business dinner that would not wreak havoc on the per diem.

The lobby is fine but beyond that the rooms are shabby with worn carpeting, fixtures and dated bathrooms. Service for HHonours is insulting and the expected standard amenities of a lounge does not exist for it's members. Check in was dismal. There was only one person checking in HHonour members and as they were occupied we went to the front desk. The attendant took 20 minutes to complete check in, slowly writing out vouchers, staring at the computer screen for long periods of time, all for a confirmed booking and simple check in. At this point we were told there was no executive lounge, even for Diamond members for breakfast and drinks. We were given vouchers for two drinks at the bar and another voucher for a coffee and muffin at the lobby Starbucks for breakfast. Are you kidding? I don't have a problem with Starbucks, and a voucher for a complementary coffee would have been a nice touch and would have made HHonour members feel like valued guests. However, this is no replacement for an executive lounge or a free breakfast at the restaurant which is offered at other Hilton's and Astoria's. The next morning we went to Starbucks and found a line up of 15 people, this line occurred each morning throughout our stay. I asked the HHonours desk if they really expected their members to stand in line for 20 minutes or more for a coffee. She replied yes. Excellent way to make you welcome. I spoke with the duty manager and he advised that all the people in line were also HHonour members. Now was this supposed to make me feel better? And how did he know this? And if this was the case, does it make it anymore acceptable? Obviously not. In any case where did the Astoria expect it's members to have their free Starbucks coffee and muffin? Apparently in the lobby, which was full of guests occupying chairs, munching away on muffins and sipping Starbucks coffee. Is this really what a five star hotel is about? Having it's guests eat take away from Starbucks in the hotel lobby? I've also attached a photo of the line up at Starbucks one morning, with several people behind me also waiting to place their order. Other staff at the hotel were pleasant, courteous and friendly. All would say hello and smile. Perhaps management, HHonour check in staff and the front desk could take some pointers from the chamber maids and bell hops on how to welcome it's guest properly and provide it's HHonour members with the respect and amenities that is expected throughout the Hilton/Astoria chain.

If you're hoping to get treated individually, reset your expectations in advance and you'll be ok. You're one (or a group) amongst thousands and you'll be treated as such. We were fortunate enough to be Hilton H Gold VIP or whatever the term is, so we received: - complimentary room upgrade (can't compare to the level below, but I saw no evidence of anything warranting an 'upgraded room' tag) - 4 complimentary drinks vouchers worth $20 each, and - a 30% off voucher for the onsite Guerlain Spa for treatments over 50 mins (massages, basically). By the way - these are also available in the Guerlain shop simply by asking for one, if you plan on using the spa. Since I had pre-advised by e-mail that were also celebrating our engagement, we received 2 additional cocktail vouchers and frankly, that was a generous gift on the basis that the hotel has no obligation to offer anyone anything for free...so for that we were grateful. But here are the reasons I take issue with Waldorf=Astoria [sic]. 1) The check-in really is shoddy for a 5* hotel. It's chaotic and understaffed for an hotel of this size 2) The room temperatures are set at 23c/73f throughout the entire hotel and cannot be adjusted from your in-room controls (why install a redundant temperature control gauge in there then, you ask?). After the first night sweltering in our room I went to reception the next day and was advised that the hotel 'climate' is controlled centrally. I asked how to reduce it and was advised that I could \"open the window\". Hmmm...first 5* query goes off in my head. So there's your choice: 23c/73f (our house is usually set at 20c/68f), or whatever melange you get by opening the window and combining 23c with outside air temp at the time. On this point I'd also mention that as a consequence during the night, we were both gasping for water and in the absence of anything else, I threw caution to the wind and cracked open 2 bottles of water from the MiniBar (schoolboy error, I know). When they subsequently applied a $20+tax per 300ml bottle charge to my bill, I took exception and brought it back to the reception desk. I'd have paid a 'reasonable' charge, but under the circumstances I felt aggrieved. What really made me laugh out loud was when the guy at the front desk looked indignant and explained to me that I had chosen their \"Premier\" water. I nodded knowingly (in that condescending way that apparently only Brits can do), as if I'd suddenly understood his explanation, and that $76/litre of water ($347/gallon) was remarkably good value! Then I told him to remove it and stop wasting both our time. He did, but looked very hurt. 3) Without the vouchers we were fortunate to have received, you're looking at $18-24 + tax + tip per drink, which explains why the majority of people in the bars are corporate suits on an expense budget. Again I am conscious that being the W=A [sic], they feel justified in sifting out undesirables at the bar by having high bar prices, but it's as well to be forewarned. It's an ok hotel, it really is. And if you've never seen art deco hotels like The Savoy, or you live out of the city/state/country and have always loved the images of Marilyn Munroe and JFK staying here in the 60s, then it's probably worth the tick in the box. But if you've got a budget, want real value for money and are happy to just drop in and have a cocktail to take your photos, I'd suggest that NYC has far better places in which to stay for similar or less money. It's a tourist destination, not one in which I suspect many East Coast Americans would ether stay or would get excited about. Oh - and I didn't mention it to my fiancee when we were there, but there were plenty of telltale signs that the maid had not cleaned the bathroom properly after the previous occupants had left.

The breakfast brunch buffet is magnificent, fit for royalty! You can array of exquisitely prepared options. The bar/lounge is lovely for a cozy break before dinner or just to relax. Their chocolate martinis are yummy! The staff at the reception were friendly and helpful, although the bar/lounge staff was a bit indifferent.

We had a small living room, classically furnished, a very comfortable couch and a plate of snacks waiting for us. At the end of the living room, on the left, there was a white double door. We opened it, and there was the bed: a huge, white, shiny bed! It was so comfortable, that words wouldn't be enough to describe it. From the room, we had access to the bathroom, it looked like the bathroom of Queen Elizabeth (not the I have ever been invited by the Queen, but that's how I imagine her bathroom to be)! There was a shower, an amazing bath tap, soap, towels....everything signed Waldorf Astoria! The point is, in such a famous hotel, this is what you expect to get, but looking into details, I saw the wall paper falling apart (in the bathroom), the shower was quite small and old. Our room had a terrasse, so right after a tour in the suite I jumped out and that's where I have been disappointed the most! The terrasse was huge, at the end of it there were table and chars. They were so old and falling apart, that the idea of taking a sit, couldn't even cross my mind. On the terrasse there were 2 windows which didn't belong to our room. Since curtains were falling apart, we were able to see inside the rooms and we saw all kinds of old, dusty objects which (I assume) used to belong to e hotel and they were just stored there.

We wanted somewhere comfortable and central. Our cab from the airport meandered through the traffic and skyscrapers of Manhattan to drop us off at the main entrance to the WA. Unfortunately the hotel is having some exterior works done and our initial view of this iconic building was blurred by the protective coverings. Once through the 5th Avenue revolving doors and up a seemingly small staircase the iconic lobby appeared and we found ourselves surrounded by the opulence and grandeur for which the hotel is known. Checking in was easy as there were no queues and we took our own bags up to our room although we could have opted for a uniformed bell boy. We stayed in a standard (deluxe) Queen room. It was an adequate size for a downtown hotel room with an extremely comfortable bed with excellent pillows and high cotton content bedlinen. There was a huge TV screen facing the bed. Our room faced onto the street (didn't work out which one) and we had a view of the opposite hotel rooms - so kept the blinds down when we had the lights on! The bathroom was a decent size with a bath and shower. The shower took a while to get hot and I had to get my husband to work the handle. This was a bit frustrating as my first impulse on arriving was to jump into the shower but I had to wait for the water to catch up! Once I had it sussed though it was fine. Free wi-fi is available in the lobby and there is a Starbucks on the premises - at the 5th Avenue entrance. This is a premium Starbucks and charges premium prices - even though they had run out of cinnamon. There are several places to eat in the hotel but we didn't check them out as we wanted to get out as much as possible. We didn't use room service - after checking out the prices. I wanted a massage in the Guerlain on site spa but at 180 dollars for 50 minutes I decided against it. We enjoyed our stay in this historic landmark. We stayed there for the ambience but if we visit NY again will probably stay somewhere a little smaller and less iconic. The hotel was quiet when we arrived but became very packed as there was a convention of psychoanalysts on during our stay and this made the lobby a little uncomfortable! On checking out we were charged for an item in the mini bar that we hadn't had but this was soon sorted out. (I had made the mistake of using the mini bar as a fridge to cool my own juice and it had automatically recorded this as a sale).

Too much hassle, too much pushing, too many people and much too long. At the hotel, which is so very conveniently located, close to everything, there were no porters or bell boys to help us with our luggage, nobody offered either, so we lugged our suitcases up the many stairs ourselves. Same thing for check out. No offer of help, which I found truly shocking. The lobby was stunning (Christmas time) as was the whole hotel . Okay, a bit dated but that is part of its charm I think as well as the historical links to it. The receptionist was very pleasant and helpful, as they all were everytime I needed to see them. The concierges gave the information needed but it was never ever done in such a nice way as at reception. I felt I was disturbing them. Upon our arrival the lobby seemed like a railway station: So many people, a guide with noisy tourists showing them around the lobby, just noise and people, people and noise. I must have got used to this because it didn\u2019t bother me anymore, I stayed for 5 nights. Anyone and everyone can come into the hotel, which they obviously do. The fact that a public Starbuck\u2019s is actually in the hotel (when you go through the front door on the left) doesn\u2019t make things easier. The buffet breakfast at Oscar\u2019s was just out of this world. Lovely staff and exquisite food. Oscar\u2019s was closed on Monday & Tuesday and we went to the Peacock Alley.

The Sir Harry\u2019s bar was always full in the evening and it was a pain to have to wait for someone to leave. I sent an email to the concierge asking to print out my boarding cards and he said he had never received it because the department involved had never sent in on to him. Anyway, on checking out, we waited for about 40 mins before it could be printed out, due to the internet connection being so slow. There was no practical information given concerning what to do and where to go on 31st December, which was a real shame. We just followed the crowd on the streets in the end.

I had real concerns about this hotel reading the reviews but deep down I really hoped that Waldorf Astoria could prove them all wrong. I was wrong. Our Superior King Room was clean with designer toiletries - as you would expect, Salvatore Ferregamo - but the bathroom was dated and the room was very dark. (It is never a good sign when hotels don\u2019t want you to see the room in bright light!?). On the other hand the size of the room was much bigger than I expected for NYC. As a conclusion, like in every hotel with close to 1,500 rooms you need to be prepared for the service to be impersonal. The location is great, but the guestrooms need some serious re-decoration. Now that I have been once, I will stay next time in a modern boutique hotel, where I could get a much better room for the same price.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cRomantic\u201d", "Author": "missH2525", "ReviewID": "UR122864061", "Content": "The staff at the hotel was very welcoming and helpful.

We arrived with our 2 children after a long trip from LA, and asked to be accommodated in the new wing of the hotel. Our travel agent had requested this on booking our accomodation, as we had been warned about the old section been outdated and bleak. The very helpful young gentleman at the reception told us there was nothing available until the following day. We also got told there were no interleading rooms, which we had also requested when our booking was made. We decided to be taken up to look at the room, and then make a decision. Well, I was shocked to see what the room actually looked like, let alone the fact tat my 10 and 12 year old were offered the same standard room FOUR doors down the passage. We requested to see a manager, who was on the phone!! After a good 20 minute wait at the reception desk, I insisted that they upgrade us to a suite until the morning. Finally we were told we had a suite in the towers but the children had to sleep on roll out beds! We decided we didn't have too much choice so late in the evening, so accepted their offer. Upon entering the so called suite, we were almost knocked out by billowing cigar smoke that was coming from the room next door! To say our room stank was an understatement! We accepted what it was and made a plan with towels to try and block the worst of the smell from coming through the connecting door in our passage. By this stage it was almost 11pm so we decided to order room service, which set us back $350! The service charges were ridiculous. We had come from the Sofitel in L A which is rated around the same as this hotel. It comes nowhere near it! Not even a free bottle of water in your room, let alone the usual gesture of a chocolate on your pillow! The amount of laundry that could be reduced with the simple 'green' steps of re-using towels, would easily allow for free water and a measly chocolate. We had up to 8 fresh towels daily, even though our towels were hung up! The concierge was extremely unhelpful, and managed to send us to a so called good restaurant, which left one of us with food poisoning! The Sunday brunch was the only good thing, the spread of food was outstanding! Oh but I forgot to say it set us back $400! The icing on the cake for us in this over rated, pompous hotel! You pay for what you get in life, this was simply a rip off!

This was a special trip for my 40th Birthday and I had waited ages to go! I was really concerned as I had not read many positive reviews! I have stayed in New York on many occasions but I wanted to do it in style for my 40th so that is why I booked this hotel. So here is my view! If you are concerned, e-mail them ahead of time. I did exactly that to avoid having any issues. We had 3 people sharing a room and I was concerned about room size. We were allocated two spacious rooms to make us more comfortable. when we arrived we did have a problem as one of the rooms had been released to somebody else and I complained. We were then upgraded to a suite in the Waldorf towers which was lovely. this had a sofa bed, very comfortable, which just gave you your own bed and we had two bathrooms. They had also placed champagne in the room too. Now there are not many rooms in many hotels in New York that are really large, unless you pay a lot of money for it. So if you have more than 2 people per room and want to stay at the Waldorf, pay for a suite. The double beds are not like ours at home and you could find it a tight squeeze! Don't rely on getting an upgrade, it doesn't always happen! With regards to the hotel staff, I have to say that apart from one or two I found them to be so very polite and very helpful. You have to remember that this is a huge hotel with hundreds of staff, it's constantly busy and it's human nature to have an off day! We wanted to visit the 911 memorial and did not realise we had to book advance tickets, they did this for us and we didn't miss out. The decor in this hotel does need updating as do many in New York, but I will say this about the Waldorf, it is filled with history, you can feel it just walking around and this trip was my 8th visit, I've never felt that about any other hotel. There are photos on the walls and if you get the chance, just take an hour to look around the hotel itself. I don't think it's the best location but it was worthwhile staying there, even if it was just for the experience! So New York is a great place, to get the best plan ahead.

We were greeted by a friendly receptionist who pulled up our details within seconds, a quick swipe of my card and we had our room keys in hand. The lobby area is full of beautiful decor, if you make your way around the the gift shop there are wonderful artefacts dating way back, including a large hand written bill for a party that happened at The Waldorf back in 1935 (don't hold me to that date I had to rack my brain but you'll see it in the cabinet if your ever near The Waldorf you should go check these things out). We were staying on the 23rd floor, the lifts require a key to operate between the hours of 6pm and 6am, despite being near the top floor the lifts are fast often causing our (family of 4) ears to pop. Our room was a twin double room, with as stated two double beds in my opinion the beds were quite small, we ( 4 adults) were fine in the room but the beds could have done with a little more width. The room had a desk, wired and wireless internet, a large tv with a selection of 25 channels, you can also select a movie (for a fee) from the list through the tv menu, a lot of the films were still in the cinema too. The room also had a mini bar, stocked up with plenty of drinks and snacks...although it's rarely needed given the amount of deli's and various other food stores near the hotel. The bathroom was very clean with a lovely beige tone and beige granite worktops, the shower was inside the bath making it perfect for both those who prefer a wake up shower or those who enjoy a long soak in the bath. The rooms are serviced once a day and were always lovely and clean when we came back from a day out in NYC... this is probably more of a compliment to the house keeping staff than I could ever write in words, our room was full to the brim with bags of shopping, bags of empty boxes, empty drinks... 4 females in a room meant copious amounts of hair brushes, straighteners, make up, perfume... so to come back to a room that looked fresh and clean without the house keeping staff actually really touching our stuff was wonderful and perhaps would require a magic wand for someone like me to achieve the same :p. The Park Avenue entrance is beautifully decorated (we went for the New Year) with Christmas decor, large Christmas tree's placed around the famous piano Cole Porter would play and wonderful garlands place above each archway leading to various areas of the hotel. As for local amenities, the hotel is fabulous, it's situated between 49th and 50th on Park Avenue and Lexington Avenue. It's a short walk to Times Square perhaps 10 minutes, and there are plenty of other shops on the way like Saks, Radio City is also a short walk too. We didn't dine in the Waldorf this time round but on previous visits we have dined in the Bull and Bear, Oscars and have also been privileged enough to enjoy the buffet offered at the hotel which was absolutely beautiful (we ate in the hotel back in 2009/2010 over New Year).

They did give me $50 credit on the room account, which we used at their restaurant for lunch the next day. I spoke to a manager that day and just told him to comp the meal (which was a tad more than $50). He was very apologetic and of course I understand that they had no control over the water shut off.

It also appeared that the WA is making most of its money off of conventions and office parties and that the majority of its guests are HHonors members cashing in points. On our first night we were given a room that screamed 1987 with floral spread and rose chintz curtains, peeling wall paper and stained ceiling tiles in the bathroom and a shower that looked like it had gotten into a fight with a caulking gun. We complained and were moved to a much nicer room for the remainder of the stay. The second room was still a bit outdated but it was spacious and had a separate bathroom and changing room with little art deco mirrored dressing tables. The hotel staff was average but with such a large property I understand the difficulty in providing personalized service.

However, my one complaint is that for a hotel that was, at least for me, around $800 a night, one would think that wallpaper starting to peel at the seams, and other structural issues : the overhead beam joints on the ceiling were cracking open in several places, the bathroom also had old, ugly, dirty looking phone jack in the wall by the window, a 70's era, dingy looking push button ventilation fan that was duct taped around the seams that was on the wall near the floor by the toilet, and-- I found some weird,ugly, unused base plate for some long-time-ago mystery apparatus was on the wall in the shower. I am sure these all are resulting from years of wear and tear that should have been(and easily could have been) adressed and taken care of---especially with the reputation of this place.

The Bull and Bear was lovely the Peacock Alley good for cocktails and Harry's Bar also good. Unfortunately our last night was spoilt by a very rude barman in Harry's bar. We were standing at the bar having a drink and ordered another round. A table freed up behind us and my mum suggested we sit down. The barman shouted over at me - You ain't going anywhere without paying your cheque'. I explained a) I was staying in the hotel and cashing this to my room b) I hadn't finished my evening yet and wan't ready for my bill. In the end I said I would sign it to my room and he then had the cheek to ask me if I was leaving gratuity! I love NYC but definitely would not spend the money to stay at the Waldorf again.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c5 days at the Waldorf\u201d", "Author": "j c", "ReviewID": "UR121265046", "Content": "Day 1- On arrival upgraded by Reception when booking in, with slight prompt.

The room was very spacious with a queen size bed, desk and a bit of a view on to Park Avenue although I can't imagine you get many rooms with a view due to the high rise buildings everywhere. We assumed that the door off the bedroom led to the bathroom but upon entering we found that it was a separate dressing room complete with dresser and large wardrobes and a couple of chairs. This then led to the bathroom which was a decent size and had a nice powerful shower.

I always wanted to stay at the Waldorf having visited NYC about 25 times... but was really never on the radar. We used to stay at the Stanhope right on central park but that closed. Used to stay at the Essex house when it was part of the Starwood brand but it was sold and the new ownership ruined the hotel Anyway, I am so glad we finally were able to stay at the hotel.

Very old... but majestic. Thought I might run into Winston Churchill around the corner or Ronald Reagon but realized they have been gone now for awhile. We all three liked the propertly alot. Thought we were fortunate to stay there and would definetly stay there again. Lastly the breakfast at Ocsars in the morning was excellent. The OJ freshly squeezed.... so good and the pastries... thought we were in Europe. I guess my advice would be don't expect this hotel to be modern and new... expect to go back in time where they spent an ungodly amount of money on a hotel that was (and still is) one of the top properties in the world.... with the clasic touches of marble, granite, mahoggany and painted ceilings.

The room was clean and had nice period touches eg the fireplace and some of the furniture. I had a room facing the side of the hotel, so it was very quiet in terms of street noise. Check in was smooth. Location is great and easy for tours, shopping, restaurants etc. Food in the hotel was very good, although very expensive. A couple of niggles that prevent this from being a 5 star rating. First off, for a few of the nights the main entrance of the hotel was closed because of private functions - this seems to be commonplace particularly on Friday and weekend nights. This meant either walking around the block to the back entrance, or using another set of internal lifts that were slow and had a lot of people waiting for them. This is pretty inconvenient upon arrival with bags, or when coming back later in the evening. Second was check-out. There were several small inaccuracies on my account (eg being charged for mini-bar items that had not been used, being charged additional tips for room service delivery etc). This is standard stuff and is normally sorted out immediately with a quick apology. In this case, I had to wait while the front desk \"investigated\" by calling room service, maid service etc to get an answer. Ultimately the 'investigation' went nowhere and they eventually told me that \"if I wanted\" they could remove the items from the bill. I was left with the distinct feeling of being dressed down for questioning such small items. I experienced similar feeling when interracting with other staff at the hotel in terms of expectations on tipping and extras, which was disappointing. Overall the stay was good and if you have never stayed at the Waldorf and want to have the experience by all means do so.

They couldn\u2019t find a king room so they put us in a double. The room was a joke: old, small, dark and a little creepy; the bathroom was equally dismal. We resigned ourselves to the cramped quarters and started to unpack only to discover that there was, essentially, no closet. There were two sliding doors where a closet should have been but most of the closet space was taken up by a large duct. Since we were there for four nights and had suits, a tuxedo and gowns to hang, this was unacceptable. My husband called the desk; they were apologetic and told us that if we could hold out for one night, they would have a lovely room for us the following day. The next day we were moved into a bright king room on the 23rd floor with all the necessary modern amenities, a large walk-in closet, windows with views of the Chrysler building and a pair of comfortable reading chairs. Even the bathroom, which was well sized and functional, had a large window with rooftop views. The bottom line is the Waldorf does have nicer rooms but you never know what you are going to get.

Let's face it, it's a legendary icon of service and I had to experience it for myself. My wife calls me a snob. Maybe I am. I like things a certain way. I get annoyed when there's no valet service. I expect fast check ins, spotless rooms, a bathrobe and impeccable service...and for God's sake don't serve crappy wine or make me pay for my internet. The Waldorf almost made it. The service was, in fact, impeccable. To start, they had valet service. Yes, it's $50, but this is NYC. Apart from parking your car on top of someone else, what can you expect? Check in was quick, very professional and courteous staff. The bags were delivered to our room minutes after we arrived. The bellman happily demonstrated all the features of the room. I look around the room. Paint is bubbling on the walls and there's a stain on the bed skirt. Seriously? There's me getting annoyed. I go into the closet. Ah. Two bath robes. The bathroom is all marble and nicely kept. The shower is nice and hot. They use actual toilet paper instead of sand paper. I can almost forgive the stains. I sit down at the desk and start up my computer. Going to get on the internet I discover that I have to pay for internet access. What the hell? Paying over $300 for a room and I have to PAY for internet? They give it away for free in the lobby, in a far more impeccable environment! I'm not impressed. We call up the concierge. Within minutes she was able to get me a reservation at the Artisanal Fromagerie (another check off our list). She was smooth and efficient. Big plus there...although the hold times on the phone are absolutely unacceptable to get to them to begin with. One nice thing about the Waldorf. It's location is fantastic. There's a myriad of taxis outside the front door almost constantly. When there isn't, a doorman's whistle takes quick care of it. You can walk to several restaurants nearby. It takes minutes by cab to get to an end of the island (it took us maybe 10 minutes to get to the WTC Memorial by taxi). After dinner I sit back and relax in a rather old, uncomfortable chair and have a cigar. It's not hard to get lost in the history of the place and imagining what type of grandeur the hotel must have experienced in it's prime. Looking out the window I could enjoy the skyline and an army of yellow motorized horns. Finally I go to bed. Sleep came effortlessly. The bed was firm and comfortable. Ample and comfortable bedding. The sleep was excellent.....until 8 AM. At 8AM I'm abruptly woken to jackhammers and grinders outside my window. The banging was obnoxious, giving me a headache. Ok, now I'm really annoyed. A call down to the desk (and another lengthy hold) tells me they can't stop the work, but they can move me to another room for a couple of hours. If they could do that, they should have done it the previous night. Why would I pack everything up, move to another room only to check out a couple of hours later? I thanked her for the offer, but declined. It was pointless. \"I tell you what. Treat us to breakfast and we'll be happy with that.\" She readily agreed. The customized invitation showed up at our door within minutes. Breakfast at Oscar's was good. Very good actually. An omelette made for me, right in front of me. Good start. A great buffet with a great selection of food that was actually warm. Bacon that was thick and not overcooked (there is a difference between bacon and jerky, for the record). Excellent. Attentive and friendly staff, ensuring my coffee was topped off (without asking). Check. They have rapid check out so there was zero fuss at departure. I drop my mail in the mail slot at the front desk and go to the parking to get my car. It's already there, the bags are ready and they load them into the car for us. A solid finish. Am I a snob?

Now I love this Hotel, but since my last stay something has happened and standards have dropped. Its an old Hotel and some rooms can be battered around the edges, but I can forgive that because of the history and normally very helpful staff. One thing that is annoying with this standard of hotel is that there are no tea coffee making facilities in the rooms, you can request a coffee maker, but I don\u2019t see why, even a Travel lodge gives you this basic item. The first thing we did on arrival was straight to the Bull & bear in the bottom of the hotel, lovely old bar with normally friendly staff. Within 5 minutes of sitting at the bar one of the barmen (a Newyorker I would say) was offering out his fellow barman outside for a fight, horrible man. We didn\u2019t stay or return to the bar during the week stay. Now this may sound petty, but this hotel normally prides itself on customer service, which on past visits has always been excellent. However, on returning to the room after a days shopping you want a nice cup of coffee or tea. To arrive back and find the cups and coffee machine still dirty and no coffee is just disgusting. On ringing reception, they were apologetic and sent up more coffee, but we had to clean the cups and machine ourselves. The following day I left a very polite note on the coffee machine asking for more coffee. On returning that afternoon, we were confronted by a note left by the room attendant, it said. \u2018I do not serve coffee please call 4767 and they will send you\u2019 and yet again dirty cups and machines, she had taken the spoons away so just don\u2019t understand the thinking. Ok some will say what\u2019s the problem with that just call them, well the problem is what happened to customer service?? Well what is wrong with the room attendant doing it for the customer ? this is not a cheap hotel and its basics that the hotel should do, why should I have to call ever day to ask for more coffee and every day have to clean out the cups and machine. It was a small thing but from a 5 star hotel not acceptable, and was annoying. The last thing I have to say is checkout. Now in most hotels when checking in or out you just stand in a queue until someone is available. Here they have a person stood at the queue who then directs you to the next available person, nice but overboard and not needed. When checking out I was stood there and a customer had just checked in and left the counter, the staff member obviously was not ready to receive the next person but we were directed to go over to the counter, we were greeted by him holding up his hand in a stop motion, not even looking at us and shouting out \u2018wait\u2019 Not even a please. I think you could see the steam coming out of my ears, I walked off and just went to the next counter that had just become available, never should I have been spoken too in that way and I was to say the least p\u2019\u2019\u2019d off.

The staff seems to be indifferent to the customers waiting for a place to sit... The room we were staying at (located on the 10th floor) was quite small and in a pretty poor condition. You could not use the bathroom at night without waking everybody else. Taking a hot bath was not possible, either, but fortunately the shower was working fine. There was a minibar in the room, but the pricelist was missing...

At check in we were told that it would be about 15-20 minutes until our room was ready. She gave us a coupon for 2 free drinks and directed us to the bar across the lobby. She told us to relax with a drink and she would come over and get us when our room was ready. At 8 pm in the evening after a long day of travel a free cocktail was a wonderful surprise. Just as promised, our room was ready in 20 minutes. This level of service was above and beyond what you normally experience at a large hotel property. We had a nice sized room with a king bed on the 16 floor. By NY standards, our room was very spacious with high ceilings, a work desk, sitting chair, large closet, and large bathroom with shower tub. The room also had two large windows that opened about 4 inches each - I love a room with operable windows that allow you to get some fresh air. The room was extremely quiet \u2013 I never once heard any sound from neighboring rooms which were all occupied during our entire stay. The bed was very comfortable with soft sheets and lots of pillows. Several of the posts here talk of warn fabrics and old furniture. Our room did not have any of these deficiencies - everything was in good condition. The Waldorf is an old historic hotel with loads of old world charm. If you want a modern, sleek d\u00e9cor this is not the hotel for you. The lobby, halls, elevators, and common area are magnificent. In addition, the location is fantastic and provides easy access to most of New York\u2019s major attractions. There is a Starbucks inside the hotel and as a Hilton Honors Gold member; we received a coupon for coffee, juice and a pastry for both my wife and me each morning of our stay. We also received free Wi-Fi. We did not eat at any of the restaurants at the property so I can\u2019t speak to that.

If they are clean, quiet and comfortable, it's difficult to disappoint me. Unfortunately, my three night stay here found a way to disappoint me repeatedly. For a premium hotel that is bold enough to \"suggest\" a dress code on their website, my expectations were not met. 1. The staff deliberately overlooked an obvious issue with my room. When I checked in. The thermostat was on 65 and a window was cracked, letting in considerable street noise as well as plenty of 45 degree air. Of course, I closed the window and changed the thermostat to 72 before hearing out for a few hours. Upon returning to the room, I discovered why the window was open and the thermostat had been on its 65 degree minimum, the room was burning up at well over 80 degrees. I soon discovered that the thermostat was inaccurate by about 10-12 degrees. Why the staff decided to bandaid the problem rather than fix it is beyond me. 2. The bathroom sink stopper was not working. It would not close. How was the maid cleaning? So I used a wash rag to stop it temporarily, only to discover that the stopper was then stuck in the closed positin with a sink full of dirty water. Again, an obvious problem that should have been fixed before I ever walked into the room. 3. The tv had no picture. I'm not much of a tv watcher and I only tried it on the very last night of the stay, but still disappointing to discover at bedtime that the tv doesn't work. 4. The bill slipped under my door at the end of my stay had overcharged me by more than $200. The room rate was incorrect for the last two evenings. Luckily, I had my confirmation email with me and was able to sort it out with the front desk after showing them the email. I hate to think what would have happened had I not had my email with me. What is so hard about charging the same rate that is included in the registration confirmation? Upon educating the front desk of the issues above, I got an apology. Final notes... I was placed on a floor with both smoking and non-smoking rooms. On two mornings, a strong cigarette smell invaded my room very early in the morning (prior to 6am), waking me up. Obviously, there is a physical issue where smoke is leaking between rooms. If you want a smoke-free stay, insist on a floor that's completely non-smoking. Room size was fine for New York. Typical for New York and Europe, small for most American cities. Room was very clean. Bed was comfortable. Lobby was beautiful (as depicted in web photos). The rooms themselves could stand some refurbishment on some cases...

I would have loved to have stayed there in its heyday. I do agree with others that this hotel is resting on its history but hey they can get away with it because the place is like Grand Central Station.The atmosphere is buzzing. The entrance, the lobby, the reception area is beautiful, so elegant. Yes it is expensive but one expects that. 5 star hotels in any city are expensive. We booked a room with two queen beds but were given a king in a small room with a view of the scaffolding (no problem with the scaffolding, maintenance work has to be done at some time) Following day I mentioned it to the receptionist and she immediately changed us to a bigger room with two beds. Got lost in the pillows and have never slept in more comfortable beds in any other 5 star hotels anywhere in the world, it took a lot of effort to get up. Of course the rooms are dated, its what makes it the Waldorf but I do think that Wifi should be available complimentary in the room as it is in many hotels these days. Nothing in this hotel is free except the toiletries. You pay for the room, breakfast is not included, there is not even cofee/tea making facilities. Most of the staff are friendly and helpful. The only issue I have is with regard to security. My husband brought an antiquated Nokia cell phone which he managed to lose between the cocktail terrace and our room around lunchtime on our second day. We retraced our steps 15 mins later feeling sure we would find the phone or at least be told it had been handed in as we felt that the type of clientele who visit or stay at this hotel wouldn't be seen dead with this old relic. It never did turn up. They have enough security agents there, maybe they should be looking a little closer at their staff after all this is NY not Dubai. Next, on checking out, we asked reception if they could arrange to have our bags brought down. They told us they could but someone would have to be in the room at the time. Kind of tells you something as this is a first for us. Never in all our years of travelling have we been expected to stay in our room and wait for the bags to be talen down.

I think it's a difficult hotel to review as it's really in a category of it's own having so much history attatched to it. The check in process was efficient and very friendly and we were quickly allocated a room. When we got to the room and started to unpack we suddenly realised there was a noise like a freight train passing every few seconds, it was we realised the lift shaft the on other side of the bathroom wall. No matter, after a brief conversation with reception we were relocated without fuss to a new room. In reality the rooms are 'oldy worldy' even down to the old fashioned light switches, so if you are after chique boutique with the minimal look then it's not for you. Bathroom, again more than adequate - marble, etc although an overall 'tired' feel to it. Free wi-fi in the room that was good although so it should be at nearly $400 per night. The hotel has a very busy air about itself being the host of functions most evenings so it's not uncommon to see people around in either black tie or (as we were there halloween) in fancy dress. One disappointment was they do charge for a tour of the hotel. Location is great for sight seeing being central to lots of attractions, taxi's at the front door at all times. Lobby, fantastic and the focus / highlight of the hotel, gift shop on the ground floor fantastic for those stocking fillers. Bars in the lobby, great for people watching but pricey, e.g 2 Gin & tonics $60.00 (only did that the once!). Used the shoe shine, that was great - shoes are still clean! In conclusion, glad I've been there / done that, but will go back to somewhere like the Westin again next time as in reality a NY hotel is just a base so I'd much prefer one with a more modern room - but that's just my preference - you need to go to make your own mind up.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Palm Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWaldorf did not disappoint me, this trip.\u201d", "Author": "DMeek", "ReviewID": "UR120263358", "Content": "This was my fifth stay at the Waldorf Astoria in NYC.

One gentleman tried to be helpful to me when I was looking for ice on my floor, he told me to go to 17 or call room service, another person interjected and said to go around the corner on the floor I was on, turns out the first gentleman was correct! Ice machines are hard to find! When I arrived, earlier than check-in time, they kept my luggage for me and texted me when my room was ready, this was great as I had a meeting to be at. Food. Granted I was with a conference eating the conference food, it was great. Top notch tast and awesome presentation. If you eat on site be prepared to pay top dollar. Value.

This hotel did not seem to appear as grand as it is from the outside (probably due to the upgrading works going on right now) that covered the original structure but nevertheless, walking through the doors, up the historical elevators and into the lobby was a 'wow' experience. Living up to its name as one of the world's grand old dame hotel and a place where founder Conrad Hilton decided to buy this place, it is definitely the place to be. We are a young group of friends enjoying the hustle and bustle of the city yet, staying at the Waldorf just kind of brought us to a completely different era. The interiors, decors, dim lighting, crystals, classic structure and more. This old dame is really magnificent and exudes a class of its own. The lobby is absolutely stunning with the signature clock and the Park Avenue entrance. We saw a number of them dressed up beautifully walking around the hotel - guessing there should be a high-end event happening at the Waldorf. We arrived pretty late and it was bad traffic so the cab took us to another entrance which is located at the side of the hotel. We were given a little upgrade to a larger room, though not much view, but it was big enough to accommodate all of us. The bed was really comfortable, the room had its own entrance corridor and an extremely large bathroom. What we really love most was the Salvatore Ferragamo amenities in the bath - when I return from the trip, I found out that they just launched it officially! The hotel is huge so the corridor may be quite eerie if you are not used to staying in old hotels. The doorbell is really really special! Service was good but could be better. A little miscommunication occurred during the stay but took quite a bit of time to resolve as we had to wait for half an hour, go down to the front desk and spoke to the executive on duty at the lobby. It was full house that very day so perhaps, they were really tied up but no excuses for being the top-tier in the Hilton family. Our receptionist was really friendly and helpful but the room service server who sent up our water was rude. I asked him some questions about the order mix-up and he could not be bothered - acted as though he has finished his duty for the day, hurried me to sign the bill and did not listen to my explanation. He also insisted me to contact the room service through phone rather than to speak to him! Breakfast was complimentary, lucky enough to be awarded one, as the hotel ran out of the room we reserved. It was at the Oscars and I feel it could have been better but the spread was quite a variety. The other restaurant was closed for renovation works so we did not manage to try out. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who plans to stay in New York, and hopefully get a good deal from them! We got an advance rate from their website and it was really worth it. The location is pretty convenient, lying on Park Avenue and just a few blocks away from Grand Central and Fifth Avenue.

This is our third stay here, and second \"free\" one. The last time we stayed for free, they put us in a glorified broom closet (albeit one with a window overlooking the air conditioning plant). I was a bit curious as to what we would end up with this time! Check-in was quick and easy, and our room was available even at noon. Agreeing to check in at noon is often just asking for a broom closet, and I mentioned to the front desk clerk that we would be willing to stow our luggage and come back later if that would give us a better shot at a \"Park Avenue view.\" After some ticking on the keyboard, he said that the room we could have right then was \"very nice\", and as it turns out, we got a generously sized room (especially by NY standards) with a Lexington Avenue view. We even got one free bottle of water out of the minibar per person per day (not a huge whoop but not $8.00 a pop, either). But the bottom line is that I felt that we were treated like frequent, full-paying customers. The room itself was very well appointed, with a couple tiny examples of the hotel's age showing through (hardly worth mentioning). The bed was very comfortable (but not Westin comfortable, though) and we drowned in the pillows provided. Toiletries were of good quality (Salvatore Ferragamo...who knew?) and good quantity. The full-sized built in medicine chest is a very convenient touch. The only complaint I had was a coffee maker is available only upon request, and the one I requested during the afternoon (in plenty of time for the next morning) was never brought up (I did not call back down a second time). And I HATE those flourescent bulbs everyone puts in hotel lamps any more, but what are you going to do? We did not hit the bars or restaurants here as we had done so during previous visits and there are millions of others in town. Tip: out the Lex Ave entrance and north a half-block is an outpost of the ubiquitous Cafe' Metro. Excellent place to begin the morning without spending a fortune. Also the 4-5-6 line subway is right at this corner, as well. I have read in many posts about poor or indifferent service in this hotel. Could it happen? Sure, especially in a hotel this size with the myriad things that go on here. But in three stays here, I have not once seen any indication of it. I simply love this hotel.

I had a group deal as my conference was held here, of \"only\" $330 per night (plus taxes, etc.). First thing you need to know, this is a gigantic hotel, with a couple of towers, with over 1400 rooms. It's like walking into a gigantic cave, never to see daylight again. The lines to check in at the lobby were enormous, and every time I walked by it, they were the same. People, hundreds of people, everywhere. Crowded and impersonal. The d\u00e9cor is frozen in the 1930s, and some furniture might have been here since then. The endless hallways still stink of cigarette smoke. The rooms are... barely ok for a \"semi luxury\" hotel. My room had an AC installation where you could still see bare wood through the holes in the paneling. To boot, I had to call downstairs because some kind of fan next door was making such an ungodly noise that I found it difficult to sleep. The view from my window... that was a direct view of the other side of my tower and was decidedly depressing; I kept my shades down all the time. I called the operator to find out if I had to go to another tower to access the 18th (\"Starlight\") floor for my event, to be told I had to.

I knew it had been under renovation for some time, but I had seen the reviews start to improve, and expected that the refurbishment was starting to show benefits to guests. I did contact the hotel in advance to express my concerns about getting a shabby room, and was assured they would get me a good room. First impression of the hotel was not good. Our car from the airport pulls up to the main entrance, and the doorman comes to the trunk of the car was it opens and takes out my carry-on bag, leaving me and my wife to handle our two large suitcases. Then he just leaves us there with the three suitcases. I figured, what the hell, lets just go check-in. But there is no way for a guest to get into the front door with suitcases, as there is a staircase immediately inside. Finally the aloof doorman asked if we would like him to take care of the bags for us. I held back any sarcastic replies and confirmed. At check-in I again asked about the room, and was advised we'd been upgraded to a Superior room. I also asked about further upgrades, as I had opted in advance to pay up for these if they were available. The check-in guy didn't seem to take any notice of what I was saying. Well, I will admit the room was large. Probably last decorated in the 1980's and last maintained not any time in the recent past. I cant fault a room for decor, as that it a matter of taste, but this was just lacking in any way. It's the Waldorf ! It should at least have some opulence and air of luxury, rather than old tenement. It just felt dirty. Carpeting left much to be desired. No hotel slippers in the room, but the next day I managed to get 2 pair by going down to the lobby. In the bathroom was rust around the bathroom fixtures, peeling paint and just a plain old smell. I will give them kudos for bringing us a second fridge. The fridges in the room do not allow you to take anything out, without immediately being charged. Whether you use the product or not. We had medication with us that needed to be kept refrigerated. So they did at least bring us one of the older fridges. I just wonder why they upgrade the fridges and not the rest of the room. The best thing about the room was the bed. It's that nice Hilton bed, very comfy. Rest of the room was the pits. The lobby is great, and it liked a NYC thoroughfare. Crowded, noisy and full of atmosphere. Don't stay here if you are looking for the personal touch. We only had drinks once at Peacock Alley. Otherwise we didn't frequent any of the other bars or restaurants in the hotel. We purposely did not take breakfast in the hotel, as this is NYC, and I wanted to get out on the streets. By day 2 we found Burger Heaven a short walk away, and had nice diner style breakfasts at the counter. Nice clean, reasonable and cheerful place with many regulars and friendly staff.

I'm not a big fan of the front desk as it seems to always have a line, so I tend to take care of my business during off peak times (early AM or late PM). With so many wonderful properties in NYC this isn't my absolute favorite, but if you're into nostalgia and antique furnishings it will be the place for you.

She even went away to get 2 levels of approval to put me up in a tower suite for 1 night as they were fully booked. 2. Value - this is a luxury hotel in mid-town and for the price I paid (around the $250 mark) it's really good value. It is close to attractions in mid-town. 3. Wifi in the lobby (Big hotels obviously don't usually give wifi) 4. Rooms are stylish, comfortable and of a decent size.

If i had to be critical (and i really don't want to be) it would be that as its such a beautiful hotel and is very busy sometimes i found it quite difficult to find a seat in either the Park Ave lobby or the main lobby, but its worth waiting for! On another note, we upgraded before travelling from a deluxe room to a Superior Room, which although i don't know what a deluxe room is like, our room was via a small hallway (how posh)!rather than straight off a corridor and i'm guessing slightly bigger, with a better view. The room was equipped with all the necessary items you would expect including mini bar and ipod dock, and the bathroom/dressing area was immense and decked out in marble.

Admittedly I was a tad early for check in but I expected a bit more in the way of customer service and pampering from such an iconic hotel. Instead my bag was whisked away to the store and I was dismissed to amuse myself for a couple of hours until the agreed 3:00pm check in time. Not much fun when you have been travelling for 12 hours. So I was less than impressed when I re-presented myself at the agreed hour only to be told that as the \u2018system\u2019 was down they could not process any check-ins and to \u2018check back\u2019 in an hour! After a bit of protesting I was grudgingly given a voucher for a free drink in the bar, and at $20 for a small glass of wine I sure as hell was not going to pay for one, and after further protest they added 24 hours free Wi-fi access (normally $15.95 a day). The reception staff were professionally sympathetic, albeit the rather effeminate male receptionist a bit over the top. ( He reminded me of Serge from Beverly Hills Cop, I think his name was Ramone, but of course it would be), but it did seem all very rehearsed and training manual derived as opposed to spontaneous and genuine. In short, it was all very hiltonised. I had requested, and got, a room as high up as possible, on the 51st floor with sort of views of sort of the Queensborough bridge sort of between the buildings. The room was a \u2018Queen\u2019 room, quite consistently appropriate given my check in experience. As one would expect from such a place everything was in impeccable condition if a little bit dated from a design point of view, very 80\u2019s country house hotel type d\u00e9cor. Other than that it was a very, very average 5 star hotel room. In fact, if you forgot about the fact that it was such an iconic hotel it was all a bit disappointing and poor value, even on the special rate paid. I\u2019ve had a lot better for less (as the politician said to the\u2026..) As for the food. I had room service on the first night. I mean you can\u2019t stay at the Waldorf Hotel and not have a Waldorf Salad can you? So I was a bit miffed when all I got was a rather small ordinary almost waldorf free salad, (I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re right out of Waldorfs at the moment, there has to be a sitcom in that somewhere) an un-chilled plastic bottle of still water with a glass of ice and a wedge of what looked like bought in cheesecake delivered on a trolley. Again all very basic and $65 to boot! After that I decided to avoid the $30 breakfast, instead I ended up having a veritable feast each morning for $3.99 in the Madison Avenue deli just around the corner. I had dinner in the Bull and Bear cocktail bar on the last night but again it turned out to be very, very expensive for what it was. Again, poor value. Would I stay here again. Definitely not.

First in 2006 and again in 2008 and a return to New York next year is in the pipeline and i wouldn't hesitate to book the Waldorf! It's arguably one of the most famous hotels in New York, if not the world, and has long epitomised the upper class choice. However, it may look and feel upper class, but if you shop around then the prices aren't as bad as you might think. The second you walk into the main entrance off Park Avenue your breath is taken away by the sheer opulence and the inviting scent of fresh flowers which are in a massive display almost dominating the marble floored entrance. Walking through to reception you pass Harry's Bar (more on this later) and your immediately transported back to the 1930's with all the wood panelling and Art Deco glamour. Check in is always swift and efficient. The receptionists don't generally exude the same relentless niceties that you find in the big department stores but then this is the Waldorf Astoria and not Macy's so a little decorum is expected. From receptions it's straight into one of the bank of elevators that seem to arrive surprisingly swiftly to take you to your floor. We didn't pay extra for a delux room or suite preferring to save our money for the shops and you do notice this reflected in the decor of the room. It's clean and tidy and functional but, in my honest opinion, it's not particularly glamourous. Having said that, how much time do you expect to spend in your room when you're in New York!!! Robes and slippers are provided and the maids clean the room and change the towels daily. Newspapers can also be delivered daily if requested. We were surprised to note that there were no tea or coffee making facilities but room service was only a phone call away! When it comes to drinking and eating, as with most decent NYC hotels, there's a wide selection of both. As i mentioned earlier, you can't go to the Waldorf without visiting Harry's Bar. It's a delightfully charming bar situated just off the main reception area. It's pretty low key - a small screen in the background keeps you abreast of the news around the world but people go there simply to meet and chat. As with most NYC hotels, the drinks aren't cheap but then what price is an ambiance like the one on offer at Harrys? Then there's the iconic Bull and Bear situated on the other side of the hotel with an external door leading out onto the hustle and bustle of Lexington Avenue. This bar is where you'll see high-flying business men striking deals and watching the latest stock prices filter through on the ticker tape. Opt for a seat at the bar to watch the bar tenders mixing an endless array of cocktails - if you're not sure what to have then tell them what you like and let them do the rest. Or, you can bag a discrete table in the corner for a more intimate evening. Food is available in the Bull and Bar or you can book a table at the restaurant adjoining. We chose to stay in the bar to eat and just had a couple of starters between us as the portions are pretty generous. In the main reception lies Peacock Alley open from breakfast through to dinner. We've not eaten here, preferring instead the hustle and bustle of the Bull and Bear. For breakfast though, it's got to be Oscars for some AMAZING American waffles and pancakes or for lunch to taste the eponymous waldorf salad. Location wise, the Waldorf is ideally located close to mid-town and just a short walk from Grand Central Station and the Empire State building. In summary, if sleek and chic is your bag then the Waldorf probably isn't for you but if you want to experience some real old fashioned New York glamour then look no further, i promise you won't regret it!", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel on a grand scale\u201d", "Author": "gmorris194", "ReviewID": "UR119277093", "Content": "I stayed here on business back in July 2011, this was the first time i had stayed here and i must say was really impressed with the granduer and style of the hotel.

I think you're mostly paying for their lobby decor and their history. Pros: Location. Beautiful lobby floor. Cons: Shows sign of age. Small rooms (but oh well it's midtown). - The bathroom toilet didn't flush well. Out of the say 10 times I flushed the toilet during my 3 day stay, I had to reflush 7 times. The bathroom ceiling looked like it had water damage (those bubbles looking things). Their air vent was FILTHY. I can understand they don't want to do major repairs, but cleaning air vents is easy to do. Dust was caked on so thick in some places it was starting to fall down in chunks. It's right above your showerhead, so you can't miss noticing it taking a shower. Ick. It was like that the entire stay. - Metal detectors. Yes, the first thing I encountered was those airport security type metal detectors. I had to stand in line and put my handbag in the detectors. Not very welcoming. Plus I went out for coffee and came back in 15 min. I still had to stand in line again and do the same thing. I was there during UNGA. Swarms of delegates everywhere. Hotel must have been at full capacity. - Overzealous hotel maids checking on security? Getting out of the room in the morning, a hotel maid stopped me and said \"Excuse me, what room are you coming from?\" I said 12XX. She said she was used to seeing a tall girl there, not me, and waited expectantly, as if I needed to explain further. So I said \"Yes, that's my friend.\" Are the hotel maids here doubling up as hotel security?? I was dressed in khakis and a white shirt with wet hair from having just showered, no makeup. Did I look like I wasn't supposed to be staying there? The maid was courteous but it was odd to be asked what room I had come out of. We had put out the \"do not disturb\" sign so it couldn't have been that the maid was figuring out whether to clean the room or not. Front desk: My friend got a message that a package had been delivered. They told her they couldn't bring it up to her. So we went to pick it up after dinner. The front desk person after midnight could not find any notation of a package. He checked several times and said it simply wasn't there. He asked to describe what we were expecting. Friend said \"Black dress, from St. John's\" and that we were down there because another person earlier had told us the dress could not be delivered to the room (at the Waldorf?! Don't they have staff to do this sort of thing?). He finally found a reference to the package and told us it was in their Business Center, that he had to first contact some other person to get the key to the center, etc. We got tired of waiting and asked him whether he could send the dress to the room. Thank goodness he said yes.

We stayed for four nights. Our party consisted of my husband and I and our 2 boys aged 12 and 9. On checking in we waited a few minutes and another desk was opened and we were served by the Night Manager \"Yon\". He went to check us in and commented that he thought the room that we had booked would not be comfortable for as my husband is 6ft 10\" tall and we had booked a double-double. We assured him that we were used to it but he offered us a suite albeit on the smoking floor. We gratefully accepted and excited went up to \"17H\". The suite of rooms was absolutely beautiful. We had a marble lobby area with butler area, a massive sitting room with windows over Park Avenue and a view of the Empire State Building from 49th Street window. There was a massive master bedroom with huge flat screen TV, DVD player and Bose radio. There was a large dressing room and a huge marble bathroom with separate toilet and shower and bath with 2 vanity areas. The rooms were spotlessly clean and richly furnished. There was bottled water and bowls of fruit that arrived at intervals. The suite smelt beautiful - not of smoke that you might have expected. The hotel delivered 2 rollaway beds for the boys and they set up camp in the sitting room. We are delighted to have a few nights in our own room after many days travelling altogether! The Concierge were very helpful in recommeding restaurants that the children would also like and all staff that we encountered were friendly and efficient. The hotel itself was like walking back in time. The displays and photos all around I found very interesting and we looked around the hotel and the various function rooms and you can begin to imagine what life for the guilded few was like 80 odd years ago. The hotel trades on it's past and why not - I really enjoyed it - and the people watching! It tied in nicely with the final part of our holiday - travelling home on the last ocean liner. For that our cabin was smaller than the walk in wardrobe in the Waldorf!

Consecutive of course but the hotel could not combine the reservation for some reason and as a result on the third day we were asked to pay cash for our room service coffee and hot chocolate ($32 plus $5 tip and the coffee was terrible). Twice. Once by the waiter and once by the manager who called us. I called down to Guest Services to ask them to use the credit card we used at check in (check in by the HHGold desk was smooth and pleasant) and got lots of attitude and argument until the staff member finally looked in her computer and pulled up the information. Unnecessary rudeness. Our room, a King Superior was nice with high ceilings, crown molding,beautiful furnishings and extremely quiet, but since we had to have a rollaway bed it was too small and felt cramped. We should have been given two beds and I'm not sure why we weren't as we booked months in advance. At check in we were told that as Honors members we would receive free wireless internet (wifi), two free bottles of water per day and certificates for two free drinks at any one of their bars. My husband had a little trouble connecting to the internet but the front desk sent someone up immediately and all was well with the internet for our stay. They had to be constantly reminded to replace the waters. Every day sometimes 2 x. The drink certificates were great my husband and I had a Cognac and a Cosmopolitan respectively and they threw in a lemonade for our daughter and a tray of nibbles. Very nice. The maid service was good and the concierge desk was unfailingly polite and helpful. This being New York we tipped well and often for the service we received because this is how these people make their money. It was appreciated. Overall, if you use points for this hotel it is a fantastic deal. The midtown location makes getting around the city extremely easy and inexpensive since a lot of what you want to see and do is close by or a cheap cab or subway ride away. I'm not sure how the $329 rate compares to other hotels in the area, it was low season supposedly so perhaps that is a good rate. With taxes and fees it was around $400.

The location is excellent, about 15 min walk min from Times Square, 2 min to Central Station, 15 min to Central Park and 10 min to 5th Ave shopping. Upon arrival the first impression is that the foyer area is grand and impressive although for first timers it might be a little confusing of making your way from the underground garage to the lobby. Being a Diamond member with Hilton Honors you do not even have to line up in the lobby for check in, instead you are ushered into a office for an efficient check in and for this stay I was kindly offered a complimentary upgrade to a suite and Starbucks breakfast by the General Manager. Once check in was complete I went up to the 27th floor with glimpses of Park Ave. The lounge room was large for and included a fireplace and there was complimentary wifi. One concern was that the room next door to the suite was occupied and I could hear the neighbours from within the lounge areas as the two rooms shared a common entryway. It would have been nice if the door would be made more sound proof. Although the lounge room was large in size the soft furnishings and furniture were a little tired to be honest. However the bed as usual was extremely comfortable and the room was completed with a walk in wardrobe. The bathroom, although functional and clean it was a little small in comparison to the size of the suite and was similar in size to that of a standard room. From reading the guest informant there appears to be a big difference between the type of bathrooms in the Waldorf Astoria Towers as opposed to the Hotel. Further, in prior stays the amenities were Penhaligons but this time around was the standard Waldorf Astoria Verbena amenities which were a little disappointing. Other room amenities that made the stay more comfortable were bedroom slippers and robes. Now for the rest of the hotel, the concierge staff are efficient ( although sometimes there is a bit of line) as the hotel is so large and during holiday season there are plenty of first timers to New York. Some of the concierge staff are more helpful than others but then again it is New York and providing tips does help. Regarding line ups, there is one thing that all guest have to line up is for a coffee in the morning at Starbucks.

The wi fi worked only occasionally which was desperately frustrating. The furniture was mahogany and dated but the bed was very comfortable; if a little small. Now, the problem...the bathroom was an utter disgrace. Mixer taps where you couldn't get the right temperature and you had to run the taps for about 2 mins to get the temperature up. The water pressure in the sink was pathetic. The toilet seat was broken and at a jaunty angle. No seperate shower (shower in the bath). Loads of mildew. Horrible. Later on, we had a few dealings with the concierge who was nothing short of rude when we asked about a transportation to the Newark airport. He basically laughed at us and told us that we should have booked it the day before and told us that a taxi would be over $100. Well, we got one in the street for the fixed fee of $75. What a $%&* that concierge was. Overall, excellent location but this is a tired old building with an old fashioned attitude to what's expected from customer satisfaction. I read before we stayed that we should spend our money elsewhere as this was a hotel relying on a reputation built up in the 50's and 60's, well, I wished I had listened to that advice because thats exactly what this hotel is.

Unfortunately our \"superior\" room at over $400 per night was so bad that we were moved to a suite in the Waldorf Towers. Our original room had holes In the wall, peeling paintwork, broken lighting and was dirty and dusty. After calling reception to explain this, we were told to wait around an hour to \"see what they could do\". I asked for someone to come up and see the room as I was astonished it could be so bad but was then just given a suite in the more expensive part of t he hotel. I got the feeling that the reception staff though I was trying to gain a free upgrade and that they weren't really interested in the disappointment we felt. Unfortunately, whilst the suite was very large, it absolutely reeked of stale cigarettes (we'd asked for a non smoking room) and was also shabby. Not once were we contacted by any member of staff to see if the room was acceptable and the service was exceptionally poor. Out of the 40ish Hilton Hotels I've stayed in, this was truly the worst. I have NEVER complained at any of the others and was expecting the best here. As our trip was only short, we put up with it and didn't want to spoil the rest of our time in NY. What should have been a memorable birthday trip was quite forgettable at this hotel. If you want to experience old style glamour and charm then choose The Plaza hotel - similar priced and with far superior service with staff that genuinely care about your experience!

His friend motioned him to let him know guests could hear him and he just dismissed it as who cares. At cocktails of $18 and up, this is not the behaviour you expect from the bar staff. Is this the standard of a 5 star hotel? I dont think so. I stay in a lot of them and this has to be the absolute worst hotel I have ever been in.

This was indicative of their approach overall--good solid customer service with the goal to make it a great stay for their guests. I know the Waldorf's reputation is for high cost and found this aspect mixed. For a suite, we paid less than what we have at times paid for single rooms in other Times Square hotels. So, we felt the price for the suite was quite good. However, prices for some of the extras were quite high. Massages in their newly renovated spa were priced out of reach and the items in their lobby Starbucks was twice what it would have been at their other locations. On the other hand, we had room service one morning and found the delicious breakfast portions were so large that one meal was easily shared by two, thus making the price for one comparable to going out to a restaurant for both.

(My spouse and I stayed there in mid-November 2010; see my December 2010 review titled \u201cNew York City: The Waldorf Astoria: Prestigious Name, But Service Level Is Lacking\u201d.) We found ourselves back at the Waldorf in January of 2011, despite saying in my last review that there were other choices in town. So let me explain ... Shortly after my review was posted (I also completed an online survey from an independent company reviewing the hotel), we received a letter apologizing for the mistakes we experienced during our November 2010 stay, and offering us a complimentary night in an Astor Junior Suite to make amends. If you can splurge on an upgraded room, this category is quite spacious, with a large sitting area with desk, sofa, two wing chairs, side and coffee tables, large TV, and a wet bar with a sink but no refrigerator; the wet bar area also a lack of appropriate glasses and utensils should we actually want to use the area to prepare a drink. (There was a minibar, but that was in the bedroom, not in the living room area.) French doors (mirrored, not transparent) separated the living room from the bedroom, where there was a king-size bed, two night stands, a small closet (which I think was the only closet for the large room), a dresser (containing the minibar) and a second large TV. The bathroom was large by any bathroom standards (so for a NYC hotel room, it was huge) with a separate shower and soaking tub and double-sinked vanity. Each room had its own window or windows, and each had its own thermostat. We took advantage of using this room to the fullest, visiting the city on an incredibly cold January weekend. (Living 1.5 hours away, we visit NYC often, so we were able to just relax and watch some movies rather then brave the cold city streets for sightseeing.) As Hilton Hhonors Diamond members, we were offered two free drinks in any of the hotel bars (we chose Sir Harry's; the coupon was good for any type of drink) and two free bottles of water. Unlike at other high-end Hilton properties, there is no executive floor at this property, and no free breakfast is offered other than a coupon to Starbucks for a beverage and pastry, but as with our last stay at the WA, the lines at Starbucks were ridiculously long, and we did not redeem our coupons. The hotel provides free wi-fi to its Gold and Diamond members; however, we did not get free movie promised as part of Waldorf perk (the hotel claims not to participate in that part of the program). We used the Diamond check-in area with minimal problems - another guest arrived just after our check-in began, and it was clear that he received preferential treatment over us because he was a repeat customer. I don't mind if that sort of thing occurs, but don't \u201crub it in my face\u201d. There was a private event happening on Saturday evening in the Park Avenue Cocktail Terrace/lobby area; therefore, hotel guests could not exit on the Park Avenue side of the hotel. During the event, guests were directed to the Lexington Avenue entrance, which wasn\u2019t a big deal, but it would have been nice if a card or memo was left in the room instructing guests of this detour. As it was, I had arranged to meet my spouse at the Park Avenue entrance to depart for dinner, which caused a bit of running around when the private event ended after I had left for our meeting point (and was directed to Lexington) but then opened again in time for my spouse to be waiting at Park. To summarize, we had a good (second) stay, particularly with our Astor Junior Suite accommodations, but I maintain my \u201cbottom line\u201d from my last review - there are other great hotels in town that I\u2019ll probably try next time.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampshire UK", "Title": "\u201cTraditional hotel - amazing location\u201d", "Author": "beenthereHampshireUK", "ReviewID": "UR116510397", "Content": "Staying at the Waldorf was my husbands idea.

I get to New York quite often on business, however this was my first stay at this property. Given the large conference at the hotel as well as the many tourists, the hotel was quite busy. Check in went smoothly and the agent was quite helpful, giving me an upgrade to a large corner room as I am a Hilton Honors member. He did notifiy me that there would be men working on my floor replacing carpet in rooms and that mine would be replaced immediately after my stay concluded. I guess that explains the strange, almost urine smell in my room. It was very noticeable each time I entered the room but I became acclimated to it each time within a few minutes and I chose not to ask for another room as my stay was only for two nights. The room was a large, virtually square room located in the corner of the building on the 8th floor which offered two large exterior windows. I enjoy corner rooms as the extra window allows for lots of natural light, ufortunately the windows were covered with what looked to be decades of grime such that you really didn't want to look through them. The bed was extremely comfortable with lots of extra pillows. I slept wonderfully and heard no noise from the hallway or other rooms during my entire stay. The room also featured a bottom-of-the-barrel Phillips television that afforded only passable video quality and abysmal audio. Woodwork in the room had multiple coats of paint built up over the decades as well. The most recent coat looked as if it had been applied by a child using a mop. There comes a time when you just can't put any more paint on woodwork and my room was long past that point. The bathroom was smallish, even by NYC standards. Although it really didn't make a difference or cause any inconvenience, I found it odd that the shower and water controls were located at the front of the shower and the shower head was located at the rear of the shower. The bathroom vanity still had some chrome effects that looked like they might be original and I don't realy mean that in a good way. I'm aware of the hotel's historical significance but when I pay for a hotel room, I'm paying for the here and now. There is a difference between \"historic\" and just plain old and this hotel crosses that line at times. I was in elevators on numerous occasions where guests would press a botton for their particular floor and it failed to light or stop at their floor. On on occasion, the light was lit for a the floor of a guest in the elevator but failed to stop at his floor, In many ways, this hotel reminded me of the Intercontinental Barclay just around the corner and why I no longer stay there. That being said, I spent some time in a room on the 9th floor that was temporarily converted from a quest room to a meeting room for my conference by removing the bed and replacing it with a conference table. This room was much fresher than my guest room and featured a much larger bathroom with a large, glass shower stall and modern bathroom appointments. This room was very nice in comparison to my guest room. The woodwork in the room was crisp and did not feature multiple layers of poorly applied paint. I did not use room service or the fitness center nor did I eat in any of the restaurants. Food at my large group lunch was a salad that I would describe only as marginally edible. I would have been very dissatistified to have received this salad in a restaurant. This was my first stay at the Waldorf=Astoria and I really don't see myself returning.

The Waldorf-Astoria has a reputation for its history of having been THE place to stay in its heyday. This is made known through its photographs of golden-era celebrities that line they halls, the stories of Presidents and dignitaries that have stayed there, etc. It IS fascinating and impressive to learn all the tales within its rich history , and I respect that this hotel is an \"icon\" of the Hospitality Industry, but overall, I felt that if you compared this hotel to a person, it'd be the \"aging Elvis\" : still famous, and talented, but losing the luster he once had. The facilities are VERY clean overall: guilded furniture, shining floors, polished mirrors. But the rugs are a bit worn , room (we stayed in the TOWERS) are a bit dated, amenities not exactly as expected. GOOD POINTS: (aside from reputation and richness of history) The best part was the STAFF! Concierge SO FRIENDLY and PATIENT, especially to a \"countrified\" out of towner like me. Bell hops treated everyone so courteously, even though we certainly were NOT the celebrities or government dignitaries I am certain they have helped before. (my luggage , a Nike Duffle Bag, was not exactly Louis Vuitton!) Room service efficient, polite, helpful: extra towels brought up promptly, unexpected chocolate covered strawberries left for us plus Champagne! Hotel bar staff SUPER nice! Rooms were very quiet, climate control just fine, beds were comfortable as well. LOVED THE FITNESS CENTER: I was not staying in N.Y.C to work out, but this fitness center was probably the NICEST environment I have seen in one in a loooong time! Impeccable, modern and GENUINELY top notch equipment!!! Spa looked good too, but it was closed until \"August 12th\" according to the sign. The BAD points: the Hotel's age is a plus and a minus. As stated earlier, there are signs of worn-out areas. Rooms would benefit from renovations: bathroom was pretty small considering this is a \"luxury\" hotel. Tub was dangerously slippery.. The WORST part is that in this day and age, HOTELS LIKE THIS CALIBER should have FREE COMPLIMENTARY WIFI in the rooms. I understand about security, but it was ridiculous they cannot provide free internet , especially after paying this much for a room. There is a Starbucks acorss the street and wifi in the lobby area (many people hung out here because of that), but it is MUCH nicer to go back to your OWN room and zone out after a long day battling N.Y.C crowds. Overall, if you are jazzed about the romantic history the Waldorf carries and do not mind a little out-dated aspects of an aging hotel, you'll enjoy your stay.

We arrived at the hotel at the Towers Entrance as that is where the taxi left us, the bell man took our luggage to reception and then shouted at us as we didn't tell him we weren't staying at the Towers! The receptionist was lovely though and arranged for our luggage to be stored and transported to the main part of the hotel when we checked in. The main reception was stunning and really made you understand why the hotel is such an historical landmark in New York. The toilets themselves in the lobby are worth a particular mention - absolutely incredible!! We went up to our room which was very large by NYC standards but was a little dated with some peeling wallpaper etc. It didn't really detract from what was a stunning room though. About 5 minutes after we arrived a butler rang our doorbell (the rooms have doorbells!! I loved this!) and brought in a tray of champagne with glasses and a printed letter which said on the envelope \"Mr & Mrs Moore - In Residence\" which was an amazing touch. The letter wished us congratulations on our honeymoon and asked us to let us know if there was anything they could do to improve our stay. A lovely touch! We decided to have a night in and make the most of the room so we ordered chinese food which the concierge helpfully gave us some menu's for. We also ordered room service for breakfast which was brought in with a set table and every dish had cloches over which was absolutely brilliant. The food was delicious and made you feel very special! Unfortunately of about 10 of the staff that we encountered about 8 were very rude and obnoxious. As I've mentioned we'd previously stayed at the New Yorker which is a much less expensive hotel and their service far exceeded that of the Waldorf. It really did make a difference to our enjoyment of the stay there and could have been improved greatly.

Staff - I checked in early and my bags were stowed by the bellhop so I could wander about the city. I explained to the check-in girl (named Mai) that it was my wife's 30th birthday. She comped us a bottle of champagne and upgraded us to a room with a better view than the one into which we were originally booked. The bartenders (Nowicki and the young Albanian) were really friendly as well. We had no complaints with the staff. 3. Room Service - pricey, but hey this is NYC. 4. Location - couldn't be better.

While the lobby is amazing, and the history of the place palpable and pretty glorious, there is much that could be improved in the hotel overall. The rooms are not big. Ours was a suite but was little more than an average sized bedroom in most hotels. The bathroom was averagely sized though the fittings outdated and generally tthe same is true of the bedroom. The style is outdated - which to some extent is fair enough, it is not trying to be a modern hotel - and threadbare at the edges. The bedroom window overlooked a roof with bits of rubble on it and the result was that the room got very little sunshine and was dark even in the day time! Despite costing about 400 dollars a night, there was a charge for internet access. There was a radio, though nothing as modern as an iPod docking station. It appeared (unbelievably) according to the room guide that there was a charge for using the hotel gym, though when we called to query this they said no, it was free. So they need to update their room guides.. The bar was beautiful, though when we first went to sit at a table we were told there was a queue - despite there being no-one queuing that we could see, and several tables free. we opted to sit at the bar - and unsurprisingly about 5 minutes later someone came and told us there was a table free. We chose to stay at the bar. The bar staff are friendly, the drinks are not cheap but it is worth having at least one drink here. I'd advise steering clear of the breakfast, it looks amazing but it is incredibly expensive - i think around 70 dollars per person - and there are no shortage of wonderful places in Manhattan to have breakfast or brunch - the Rockefeller centre outside restaurant is just one that is great for brunch. Late in the evening there are very obviously prostitutes hanging around in the lobby and/or chatting to men/potential clients. It seems strange that such a supposedly grand hotel turns a blind eye to this, but they seem to. The positives are that the staff, especially the domestic and maintenance guys, are really friendly, and that the location is very central. The downsides are the cost, the general shabbiness in much of the hotel, the lack of value for money.

We were very hungry and wanted some New York style pizza, so we went to concierge and they recommended a marvelous pizza restaurant called AperiTIVO Pizza Bar--definitely recommend it to you--which is in walking distance of the hotel. When we got our table at the restaurant we received a text message from the hotel saying that our room was ready, so we just had lunch and walked back to the Waldorf Astoria. Our suite was spectacular and we were not expecting the largeness of our room. We booked a two double one-bedroom suite for my family of four. My wife and I slept on one double bed, while teenager slept on the other bed. My other younger son slept on the sofabed, which he found surprisingly comfy, although the beds were obviously more comfortable, so comfortable that I slept like a baby. The suite was huge for a Manhattan hotel, so get you definitely get what you pay for ($500-600 per night)! It also includes a luxurious large marble bathroom. This hotel is also very nicely located--one block away from Madison Avenue, two blocks to 5th Avenue, and about a 10 minute walk to Central Park. I think that this hotel is flawless, but I have to say that their food is mediocre and very overpriced.

Ideal for a leisure as well as a business trip. A great get away. Has been in the heart of the city of New York since 1900s. Looks very palacial and has been a great host to may famous personalities since a very long time. Web special can give good rates else it is a bit expensive for a hotel stay but that is only because it is an extraordinary experience staying there. Awesome lay out of breakfast buffet. Yummy desserts. Worth trying hotel . A beautiful view of the downtown/ timesquare New York. Close to Empire state building and in the centre of the shopping hub in New York. It is a treat to see the starbucks coffee counter in this hotel. So if you are thirsty for aquick cold coffee you do not have to shell out alot of dollars ujust because you are sitting in Waldorf Astoria. I stayed there with my husband and the best part is that even though we did not have a conveyance or a private transport available, the hotel took vare of this without charging even an extra dime from us.

I can honestly say I have stayed in many hotels worldwide, usually 4 & 5 star, Dubai, Sydney, Bejing, Capetown etc, the Waldorf being the worst one by far. Finally, the conciege and reception staff were the most arrogant, rude, aloof, and unhelpful staff I've ever come across, and I think the Management should consider retraining them in good old fashioned manners and customer service. I realise they have many clients using the hotel every day as it was always busy, however they should give ALL customers 5* treatment like their 5* prices, and stop living in the past and relying on it's reputation, as it will be overtaken by new hotels.

While we had a lovely stay, I must mention that it was free to us since we were on points, and since my wife is a diamond status in Hilton we may have gotten a nicer room than normal and we also mentioned it was a special occasion for us. We were up on the 13th floor (which is odd since most hotels don't have a 13th floor), with a corner room that overlooked Park Ave and the church next door. They sent up a bottle of wine and cheese to help celebrate our special occasion. Our King sized room consisted of the bedroom area that included a small desk and another small table, kind of a dressing room with a makeup like desk area, and a gorgeous bathroom. Having read some of the other reviews, maybe our room was nicer than most, since the bathroom was all marble and granite and had a huge tube that my tall wife was able to full stretch out in which is a nice plus you don't see in most hotels or homes anymore. Everything in our room worked, and we had plenty of room for our clothes both in the closets and drawer space. They provided some nice robes for our use as well, and the closet had a safe that was larger than most I have seen in hotels and we could have easily have put our laptop into it if we were worried about it. The hotel was rather centrally located, and we had no problem walking to Times Square or a few more blocks over to Hells Kitchen. Within easy walking distance of Grand Central and catching a subway where ever you want to go. We found it a nice place to start our adventures on Manhatten. We flew into LaGuardia, and it was less than $40 with tip for a taxi to the hotel. We probably could have used the subway to get back and forth between the airports, but if you have large luggage this can be a bit of a pain. The only downsides I would say is that this hotel was expensive even on points, but when you realise you can stay at the Waldorf for only slightly more than the other hotels on Manhatten, I think it was worth it. The maid did come early in the morning, so put out your do not disturb if you want to sleep in. Even on the 13th floor, you could hear some street construction in the room if you were sleeping late.

But stay there and be prepared to be sorely disappointed. The staff at reception and the porters are very friendly and the carpets feel very thick under your feet but that's sadly where the air of luxury comes to an abrupt end. My family and I booked 3 rooms over a long weekend. One room was situated directly next to the air conditioning unit outside. This brings the phrase \"The City that Never Sleeps\" to a whole new level as you wont be sleeping either. Like us you'll be up at 2 in the morning trying to stop the constant humming that consumes the room. After a long journey the last thing you want to be doing is requesting a change of rooms which in the end is what we had to resort to. All of the rooms were very averagely sized and it's hard to place exactly what it is but much like the corridors leading up to them, there's just a feeling of not so much antique, but dated and in need of renovation. In one of our rooms the plug for the sink was broken leading it to remain full of dirty water and beard trimmings. All three rooms had problems with the televisions set. Despite being large flat screens the pictures were fuzzy and sometimes crackling. At one time the TV simply refused to show a picture. We were informed by a technician who came to fix it that it's due to the whole system running at maximum and so they've all got problems. The room service prices are laughable with a mark up bases in pure fiction for only the most idiotic person to order from. $8 for a glass of milk, plus tax, plus $15 for the pleasure of bringing it to your door, plus the expected tip. The rooms also lack any tea or coffee facilities which you'd expect in the loneliest 3 star hotel. They can be specially requested to your room but i can't help but think that this lack of amenities has something to do with the Starbucks located in the lobby. Why provide your guests paying hundreds of dollars a night with the option of making their own coffee when you can make them go downstairs in their bath rode and pay an extra $5 for the privilege? The porters outside the hotel seem to be nothing but ornamental with multiple times leaving and pulling up outside the front door in cars with no assistance from them. The cocktail bar in the lobby is very pleasant for a quick drink before heading out on the town but I'd check your bill very carefully. After only ordering 4 drinks the server made a mistake and charged us $50 for a simple martini. With their aforementioned rooms service i could almost believe it but I'm glad i questioned and had it changed. Overall a very disappointing stay and it will be a very long time before i return. Maybe they will realise they're surviving only on their past reputation and will have to improve but i doubt it and i believe their standards will continue to slip.

Booked a great rate through the WA website ($279/night) and chose an upgrade to a deluxe room for an additional $21/night. Had a great check in experience - bell staff took my luggage from the taxi and directed me to the lobby where I was approached by WA staff and directed to the proper area for check in. I had arrived early, directly after my flight arrived in NYC, shortly after 12pm. In spite of my early arrival, staff checked me in and thought to ask if I'd need a crib, extra toiletries/towels in the room, etc. The room itself was a bit of a let down. The size was fine, which was surprising for a NYC hotel room. The room just looked like it had seen much better days, and that those days were quite far in the past. Torn wallpaper, chipped and broken floor tiles in the bathroom, layers of dust, and a rusty bathroom heater made the room feel depressing and not at all what I expected from a hotel with the reputation of the WA. Our stay was unimpressive, other than being able to tell cab drivers to \"take us to the waldorf\". Once we arrived back at the hotel we had to use the motorcoach entrance in the basement as it was the only way in and out with a stroller - we didn't get to take in the splendor of the main entrances. The food and beverage prices were outrageous. My chopped salad and bottle of water through room service were $54, my omelet and coffee in Oscar's were $51. There was no coffeemaker in the room, but we made do with morning trips to the Starbucks tucked under a staircase in the main lobby (again, no easy way to get there with a stroller). Service beyond check in didn't really exist, although there were large numbers of staff milling about the lobby area regularly. Prior to our visit we received an email about the WA dress code (no jeans, business casual, etc.), but it didn't seem to be enforced in any way onsite. The President had an event at the hotel during our stay, but except for the throngs of people around and in the hotel, we weren't really impacted. Unfortunately, the empty room next to us had some sort of incredibly loud alarm that went off regularly during our last two days. The loud screech would continue until hotel staff entered the room and shut it off - but they couldn't seem to find a way to keep it off during our stay which was quite a nuisance. While preparing to leave the hotel I called down to bell service to request help with my luggage and was told by the bell captain \"Well, we could send someone to come help you, but it will be at least 15-20 minutes so you'd probably be better off bringing it down yourself.\" When a hotel prides itself on being able to 'do the difficult in minutes and the impossible in slightly more time\", I would think that having someone help a mother traveling with an infant and 5 pieces of luggage wouldn't be too much to ask. I managed to get to the lobby for checkout where I waited in the incorrect line for several minutes before realizing I was in the wrong line thanks to another traveler. The check out experience was typical of a chain hotel checkout - asked how the stay was, but unconcerned with my response and definitely uninterested in correcting any of the hotel mistakes such as the alarm or the bell captain experience. In general, I think I would have had a better trip by staying at a different, more updated hotel.

I arrived after a long flight in the evening around 10pm. The check in process was straightforward and I was relieved to get my key. However, when I got to my very small room I could hear a very loud high pitched whirring from outside my window. There were some large units making the noise. As I was staying 6 nights I knew I would not be able to cope with the noise for that length of time so I called Guest Services to see if they could change my room. The lady advised she would send someone up to see what I was talking about. 10 minutes passed... nothing.... 20 minutes... and still no one had come up. By now it was close to 11pm, after a long flight I just wanted to go to sleep. I called Guest Services again and they said the security guard had \"already been up and did not hear anything\"... The guard had not been told to come to my room. Even though I had clearly told them the noise was heard inside my room. How very odd. Another 10 minutes and the guard arrived, he confirmed the noise and tried to phone downstairs from my room but was put on hold. I had to go downstairs to the front desk to see what was going on. The manager barely even apologised for the incompetence of his staff, not communicating, he did however upgrade me to a slightly larger room on the other side of the building which was appreciated. However when I got to the new room, it was very hot, so I decided to use the thermostat to cool it down. I also wanted some water but the mini bar was locked for some reason. I called downstairs to ask why, the lady I spoke to did not know but said she would send up some complimentary water, which was nice of her. However, it never arrived, after waiting 20 minutes I fell asleep. I woke at 4am to find the room extremely hot. I called downstairs about the water and they finally sent some up. And when I asked about the heat in the room I was told that even when the thermostat was on a low temperature it would be blowing out hot air!! What on earth?? I was told that the hotel had NO AIR CONDITIONING. Not only that, but I could not open the windows. She said they had to send an engineer up to open the windows for me. Crazy. 10 minutes later he arrived to open the windows.... The lobby of this hotel is very very dark. Even on a nice day you have no idea what is going on. Having spent close to a week at this hotel based on my experiences with the service, and basic idiotic processes to just open a window I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The Waldorf Astoria has lost it's shine and is only surviving on its name. It is now run by the Hilton chain and worthless. The rooms are very very out of date and clearly need some TLC.

And of course there is that wonderful Guerlain Spa.....As my grandmother used to say, its not whether one runs into problems, its what one does to solve them that counts! So we came back. We decided to stay in a suite this time. We booked a King suite but got a Queen. The room was nice enough. We did not complain. We were too tired to face the check in desk again!

When my husband called the main hotel line he was told it was \"corporate policy\" and apparently corporate policy is inviolate. We were reminded that if we wanted to use free wi-fi we should go down to the lobby! (Did I mention we were too tired to go to the lobby? But of course one there is always the spa....Opps!

We tried to sleep - early appointment the next morning....When we got up to take a shower we discovered the water would not get hot - after 15 minutes.....At least the wake up call came on time - and came, and came and came: the thing would not stop ringing. The lady told us we had to actually listen to the recorded message or else it would keep ringing. I told her this was ridiculous and asked her to make it stop. She did. Apparently also they had known about the problem with the water: during the night something had happened and the steam that heated the water in the building had not yet heated all the water. I was advised to wait for my shower - out of luck, I had to leave.....finally, we mentioned the cold room - the first question was whether we had called the staff during the night. I explained we had been trying to get some sleep...... The hotel made a reasonable adjustment to the room rate at checkout. We stayed here to reduce the stress of a long commute and instead of starting the day refreshed and relaxed....well, at this point: 'nuff said! Why do I continue to recommend this hotel? It huge, but its comfortable - overall. I like rooms - this is indeed an historic hotel. When there is a problem, staff do their best to resolve it. The staff make a big difference here. This matters. Its just a pity there are so many problems they have to deal with!

The group I had booked through was hosting a large event there, so I decided to stay at the Waldorf for the convenience, but was a bit concerned after reading some negative reviews. I called Hilton Honors and specifically requested a recently renovated room, and also did an e-upgrade where for $20 more, I was guaranteed the next level of room up if available. Upon check-in, I was served promptly and courteously by Justin, who took pains to ensure that a room matching my specifications (i.e. newly-renovated bathroom) was available. My room was wonderful, with a king bed and, true to their word, a newly-renovated bathroom. The oversized shower was AMAZING!!! I could have stayed in the shower all day. I was in room 767, which faced away from Park Avenue, and there was hardly any traffic noise at all in the room. The hotel's location is very convenient. During my short stay, I was able to walk to the Rockefeller Center and Times Square, and Central Park was also close by. I was a stone's throw from shopping on Fifth Avenue (Saks, etc.). (Another tip - a sales lady at the Clarins counter at Saks did an amazing job with a free makeup application for my evening event!) So what is the \"small thing\" referred to in the title of this review? After receiving my room keys, I went to the concierge to obtain a map of the city, as I was meeting a friend at a nearby office tower for lunch. Not being too familiar with my surroundings, I asked the concierge how to get to the address of my friend's office. The concierge was engrossed in his phone (either texting or surfing the net), and gave me very quick verbal directions to turn one way, then the other, then the other. Of course, it was all lost on me. I asked for a map, and the concierge (still engrossed in his phone) handed one to me, still folded up, without further offer of help. I had to unfold the map, then specifically ask him to point out on it the location of the hotel, and show me how to get to my friend's office. He did oblige, but I was left with the feeling that I was somehow imposing on him. I must be quick to say that I described the above experience in an on-line survey after my stay, and to my great and pleasant surprise, received a call the very next day from hotel staff apologizing for this, and seeking further details from me. It was, overall, a small incident, but one that marred the stay nonetheless. Management's willingness to address so promptly gives me great optimism that this is not a typical experience for guests. I paid $420 for the room, including the $20 upgrade fee. This seems like a lot of money compared to most other places, but for a classy experience in an excellent location (in the middle of Manhattan), it was worthwhile.", "Date": "April 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boynton Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cThe most beautiful hotel with historic charm\u201d", "Author": "bailey1106", "ReviewID": "UR103269577", "Content": "This hotel has the most beautiful rooms, freindly and helpful staff and just a high class feel and atmosphere.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, MO", "Title": "\u201cGlad I stayed here once but probably won't return\u201d", "Author": "Maryandfamily", "ReviewID": "UR103155008", "Content": "My daughter and I spent the weekend at the Waldorf Astoria (NYC) for her 18th bday.

I almost felt like Marilyn Monroe would come rushing through the lobby or perhaps to catch a glance of President Kennedy. So much history, you can literally feel it...in a good way, not creepy. For me, it was perfect to luxuriate in all of that space and relax after a hard day. I felt special. No small thing in this world today. My only regret is I did not have a Waldorf salad!

I like staying somewhere in the vicinity of Rockefeller Center. First, I was very impressed with the staff at the Waldorf. they had a number of staff just standing in the lobby who would offer to help without asking if you had the slightest concerned look on your face. The concierge was great and was spot on with the choices. The business center was nice, but fumbled the ball on a package delivery that was guaranteed by 8 AM, but not delivered to me. The Bull and Bear restaurant was closed for renovation, so I could not comment on it and there weren't a lot of other choices in the hotel. The room itself was on the small side, typical of New York, I guess. But it had a nice work desk, an arm chair, and a largish flat panel TV. If you want to watch TV, however, it pretty much has to be from bed. luckily the beds was extremely comfortable with many pillows. The bathroom was a little dated, but everything worked. An oddity was that the shower head was at the back opf the tub, on the opposite end from the valve, so adjusting the temperature was time intensive, as the flow restricter made you wait for a while for the temperature to change. Flow was pretty anemic. the room seemed to be very quiet, other than a thin door hardly blocking hall noise. The fitness center was OK, but pretty standard. Not what I would expect for the price. In some packages you have to pay for it and it is definitely not worth paying for. All in all, not a bad stay.

Whether or not you have ever been to NYC or not, you have heard about this hotel. Whether it's from a tv show, movie, or in the news, the Waldorf has made itself known. I remember watching a lot of movies and TV shows and seeing the characters staying at this hotel. I also have read about royalty and very prominent figures staying here as well. So I decided to look online and could very well see just from the website alone how this hotel has such great notoriety. Knowing that my father and I were planning a trip to NYC in the near future, I looked on the website again to see if I could book a room and if it would be affordable. I will be honest, the prices can be a little shocking at times if you're not used to paying a couple hundred dollars a night for the room, but I have paid that before for other hotels in other cities that were nowhere near the caliber of the Waldorf. The prices for the weekend we were looking to go were actually modest and we decided to save up a bit and give it a shot. Upon arriving the cab drops you off out front and you are immediately greeted by doorman who are more than willing to assist you in/out of car and with your luggage. My dad and I travel light so we did not need assistance but it is always good to know that it was there. I will say whenever you first walk in the place is breathtaking. The lobby looks like (and I'm sure is) something right out of a magazine. The chandelier alone will be your first photo op. Right from the start you can feel the power of the this hotel. The staff (who are all dressed to the nines) and the guests walking around, sheerly are some of New Yorks elite. My dad and I dressed for the roadtrip were not in this category...haha...but we managed to blend in enough to make it to check it then up to our room. The room is hands down the nicest I have ever stayed in. The decor is undescribable and the ambience as well. We almost felt out of place because thats how nice it is. I felt bad putting a soda down on the desk and jumping onto the bed. I immediately realized I had forgot a toothbrush(as usual) and few other personal items. I was immediately able to speak to customer service and a very friendly Krystyna was able to assist me. She actually gave me more than needed. Customer Service at this level I would think would have to be above and beyond, and to be truthful, it really is. Dan Briks and Matt Lane are the directors of rooms and front desk. We spoke to them both over the span of the weekend and they were more than able to assist us in the requests that we had. Another employee, Melissa K, found out that it was a pretty important trip for me and my dad and was able to come across two free drink tickets for one of their hotel bars. The drinks can be a bit out of the regular price range but I ordered an Old Fashioned and its exactly the way it should be made. Missy was very personable and is definetely someone who should be walking about and accessible to the guests. We then went out for the night and returned to the room and slept on beds that I wish I never had to leave. They too are out of this world. We also found out that a few celebrities were in the hotel and there is always a good chance you can have a run in! For what it's worth, and I'd be lying if I said different, the hotel for the extra money is completely worth it. If you are just looking to lay your head down then this might not be the stay for you. But if its a special trip and you plan on spending some time in the room as well as the hotel to eat/drink and people watch, this is hands down the #1 hotel in NYC.

The hotel is also very safe, with card access required past 6 pm and police regularly outside the front door (my guess would be to protect VIPs that are staying at the hotel). Others have noted no in-room safes. This was a surprise to me as well, but given the hotel offers a full vault area in the main lobby, it wasn't a big concern. Charges for wi-fi are expensive.

This was not it! After a lot of searching and enquiries we chose the Waldorf as it seemed a quintessential piece of NYC plus well located for transport and sight seeing. We specifically wanted a room with a view and at the time of booking (by telephone) a room with a view of the Chrysler building was requested for us. We even upgraded to a king bed mini suite to try and ensure we would have a nice room and view. This request was backed up via an email reply to one sent by the hotel reservation team. On arrival by taxi, no-one offered to deal with our bags or direct us to reception. Even when we asked where the reception was, the reply was curt and still no offer to take our bags. There was a big conference on at the hotel and the lobby was exceptionally busy. We had to queue for some time to check in which was not ideal after a long flight. Whilst the lobby, reception areas and bars were very opulent the corridors leading to the rooms were rather drab and dated. Our room was nice and big (mini suite) and the bed was very comfortable but that's where the positives end. The room was very dark without all the lights on which was in no small part due to the fact that it looked out onto the inner courtyard of the hotel. So much for our nice view - just 3 walls of hotel windows!! There was a cupboard that purported to be some sort of kitchenette with an ancient fridge and horrible stainless steel sink and drainage board. Then the piece de la resistance was the bathroom. This was a poky little room (even the washbasin had to be located outside of it) that the bath just about fit into. A bath that looked at least 30 years old from the 1970's. Shower was poor. The toilet didn't work properly with water continually flowing after flushing. We rang to explain that we weren't happy with the room, especially the lack of requested view and bathroom, only to be told unsympathetically that there were no other rooms available that night. The hotel did offer to move us to a higher floor the next day but couldn't tell us what the room would be like and wanted to charge an extra $50 a night. We didn't take them up on the offer and instead checked out at 7.00am the next morning, moving to the Mandarin Oriental (see review) which was fantastic. At check out they tried to charge for 2 bottles of water from the mini bar which we had been told on arrival were complimentary. I don't think we could have been more disappointed with the Waldorf which did not live up to it's past reputation or our expectations. The rooms are badly in need of being brought up to date (especially bathrooms). The opulence of the past could still be retained with a sympathetic refurbishment. The lobby might be grand but that's not where you're going to sleep. They could also take some lessons in customer relations from other hotels. It seemed they were more concerned with their large conference and the business from that than their other individual guests and their concerns. Perhaps everyone should experience the NY Waldorf once in their life but for us one night was more than enough.", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cape cod", "Title": "\u201cAn absolute dream....heavenly.......start to finish!\u201d", "Author": "capekate", "ReviewID": "UR101415353", "Content": "I have been to NYC many many times and always used trip advisor to find to check the hotel that I was considering.

Best I have ever slept in, in a hotel, and the room was so spacious compared to the accepted cozy size of a NYC hotel room. It was very easy to walk to rockefeller plaza, times square, etc. And getting a cab is pretty easy too, so the location is quite convenient. I was concerned about finding someplace to grab a snack outside of the hotel. They were only to happy to point out an array of options within a block. There is a place that is right outside the back door that sells sandwiches salads fruit on and on....and some great restaurant very close also.... I think everyone should stay at the waldorf at least once in your life.... You may find that it may become the only place you ever stay in NYC! One more thing... The parking was 50.

For a true one of a kind experience this is the place to stay now that the Plaza has re-invented itself and morphed into something unrecognisable to what used to make it so special. Not the Waldorf=Astoria. It feels like it must have been back in the thirties,forties,fifties and so on without feeling for an instant a whiff of decrepitude or running down because of age. It really is a living monument in every positive way. Elegant without being pretentious, classy without being intimidating. Beautiful and alive with a great patina to savour and enjoy. A timeless classic. I can't wait to go back.

I am a HHonors Diamond and we stayed on points- I spend approximately 225 days a year on the road, about 100 w/Hilton properties. We both love historic hotels- given the choice, we'll frequently stay at an Embassy Suites vs. a Hilton or Waldorf because of the ameneties for our style, but we have enjoyed wonderful experiences at properties like the Waldorf Grand Waileia and found the flagship wanting. When one arrives at the main entrance of the Waldorf on Park Avenue, there is a 18-20 step staircase up to the lobby level. There was one doorman and no bellmen working (the main bell desk is next to the front desk in the main lobby, 200 feet up the stairs away), but to his credit the harried doorman helped my wife with our third bag to the top of the stairs and apologized there was no one to help to the desk- functionally this was fine, as we are used to handling oour own, but the doorman at the WALDORF is having to apologize for being unable to help on a Sunday afternoon? Check-in reminded me of a Vegas casino hotel, with the line and line-minder, but they were very friendly and when our room wasn't ready offered to call me on my cell when it was and directed me to the 'Diamond Reception' when we returned to pick up our keys. When we returned, we went to the 'Diamond Reception,' which was a two-desk room, only one manned, next to the bell desk at the end of the lobby. While waiting for the couple in front of us to be waited on, I got the pleasure of listening to the bell captain talk loudly into his cell phone in walkie-talkie mode as if he was yelling at his kids at home. That said, we were given nice coupons for drinks and continental breakfast at the Starbucks at the base of the stairs (where a bellman desk would be great), upgraded to a junior suite, and the bellman who delivered our luggage (we'd left it with walkie-talkie boy when we first checked in and the rooms weren't ready) was outstanding in both service ethic and personality. Sunday night- we went to the Met for a concert, stopped at the lobby bar for a drink, great service. Two hours later, after we haad changed clothes to go for a brisk walk (from dress to casual), went back to the same bar, sat down, I ordered an upscale drink and a glasss of water for my teetotaler wife, and received a very snippy 'there's a two drink minimum at the bar' from the lady bartender. Responding 'Oh, would it help if I am paying with this?' and pulling out the Waldorf coupon with my name on it as a Diamond, she just turned around and made the drinks, no other response. When leaving, at 5 am Tuesday morningn to catch an early flight, I had to stop at the front desk to fix our receipt- I'd been charged fro Internet acceess. Very friendly staff and no problem, but why? I have this problem 1 out of 20 stays- didn't expect it here. So we head out, down the stairs, and come to find out that the flagship of the Waldorf brand, a hotel located oon Park Avenue in NY City, doesn't have a 24 hour door presence. The taxi drivers were nice- the one who took us to the airport helped my wife through the door when her bag was stuck- but REALLY? You're the Waldorf and you don't have a doorman? Please understand- this is not overblown expectations. We spent the previous two night at the Intercontinental Barclay (also on points), and the service blew the Waldorf away.

Yet, one's actual experience as a guest can be variable. I attempted to check in around noon on a weekday, having arrived by an early flight, and the clerk was polite but firm. Check-in time was 3 p.m. and I would have to come back later. In my experience, a responsible hotel will nevertheless check the system in such situations to see to see whether a room is available. She was unwilling to do so. I said I would return later and in the interim leave my bags in the hospitality suite in the Waldorf Towers section of the hotel. I was staying there for business meetings, and the suite was already open. The Towers section is normally accessible from the lobby, but when I approached it, I discovered I needed a pass key, so I had to stand in line again at the reception desk to get one. This time, I ended up with a male clerk who immediately said: \"You can certainly have a key to the Towers but first let me check if a room is available.\" It turned out that a room was, in fact, available, so I checked in. I felt that the luck of the draw was at work here. The first time I arrived at the check-in counter, I received less than acceptable attention. The second time I received the kind of attentive treatment one would expect from a hotel of this reputation. The gorgeously designed lobby has been a familiar New York landmark for generations, and it is always a pleasure to be greeted by its warmth and atmosphere, but the rooms don't necessarily live up to your initial ground-floor impressions. Again they are of variable quality, although always clean and well-maintained. But I once had accommodation so small that there wasn't even room for a small desk. This time, there was space for a desk. but the appointments were pretty basic: Very comfortable queen bed, bedside tables, dresser, TV. The only chair was the desk chair: there was no easy lounge chair for enjoying TV, reading the paper, or comfortably partaking of a room service meal \u2014 because there was no room for one. In brief, many a well-run motor hotel does better. The bathroom, although offering only a shower, was well equipped with good lighting and ample hot water. The thermostat was eccentric and difficult to regulate. Meals were a problem on this particular visit. Because I didn't think I would enjoy room service food in my room, I opted for the public areas. The hotel has stopped opening its popular coffee shop in the evening (an unfortunate decision deplored by many regulars), so that leaves either its Bull And Bear Restaurant or a limited menu in its Peacock Alley lounge. Peacock Alley was closed (because of kitchen problems, I was told) so that left the Bull And Bear, a steak and seafood place where the food is excellent, the choice limited and the prices stratospheric (the most modest steak costs $48; vegetables are $12 each extra).

Prior to arriving we requested a room with a view and a bottle of wine for check in. Unfortunately the check out was not as efficient as it could have been. Although we arrived at midday (and the hotel states that they cannot guarantee check in until 3 pm) we had to wait until at least 4 pm as we were told our requested room was being cleaned. We were happy to accept this delay as we had been quite specific about wanting a room with a view, but was disappointed to find that the view was pretty limited, overlooking the air con units. However we could see the main street and this may have been as good as it gets for a standard room in NYC. The room itself was spacious and clean. The heating was straightforward to use, and this had to be put on 'high' as soon as we got into the room. Obviously, the mini bar and the bar//restaurants are a little pricey but we expected this and as we were in NYC for such a short time we wanted to eat and drink out as much as possible, so we didn't use any of the hotel facilities. The rooms were quiet and communal areas were clean which was impressive given the amount of guests they had at this time of year. Would I book this hotel agin? Definitely. Was there a hotel we passed that seemed better value for money, better location, with the wow factor of the Waldorf? Not that we saw. We debated for ages before booking due to some of the reviews on trip advisor, but we were not disappointed. We went there with the view that we would only be in the room to sleep, but we could have comfortably spent more time in the hotel if we had the time. The location was ideal. A short walk from 5th Avenue and about 20 minutes walk from time square. We felt safe walking back to the hotel in the night as the main streets were well lit and busy. We even walked to central park from the hotel (about 30 minutes) and grand central terminal was just around the corner. Sightseeing: If this is your first time to NYC, plan ahead. This was our first trip and we were told to be prepared that we wouldn't see everything that we wanted. We did. With a bit of planning it is possible to hit all the main sights. To give you an idea our itinerary was: Day 1: Subway to Battery Park. Go to Grand central terminal help desk and get a subway map and all day travel pass (cost about \u00a310). The subway is colour coordinated so pretty straight forward to use. From battery park (we bought breakfast from a street vendor: very nice) we went to trinity church, and then back to the park to board the sightseeing statue cruise to Statue of Liberty Island and Ellis Island. I would recommend both. Book these tickets online before you go to beat the cruise. Leave half a day to tour both islands (Ellis took us the longest about 90mins). Back on land, head for financial district (wall street etc) and then to WTC. Make sure you go into St Pauls Chapel directly opposite the site as it is filled with memorabilia of the rescue efforts. There is a tribute centre nearby, and a developmental centre opposite the church to end on a more uplifting note. We then got subway to china town for dinner, and then back to hotel by about 7pm. Day 2: We walked to Central Park and had breakfast in a small diner nearby. We then walked to strawberry fields and some other sights nearby, but we didn't go further up. Too cold and not enough interests further north. We then headed back towards 5th Avenue and walked the length of this down to Times Square. Fantastic Pizzeria's around here. Keep walking to reach Flat Iron (that was for my husband I wasn't too interested). We broke up the walking with shopping, and it took us the best part of the day. After a couple of hours rest in the hotel we went to the Top of the Rock at about 7pm. Again pre booked online saved the queues. Fantastic views of manhattan. Day 3: We got on the subway to Brooklyn and walked the Brooklyn Promenade to take beautiful photos of Manhattan skyline. You can walk Brooklyn Bridge, but at this point we had enough walking! We walked a few streets in Brooklyn to look at the beautiful houses. Again we felt perfectly safe. We got on the subway and headed back towards times square and we went to the Empire State building to have a view of Manhatten by day. Again fantastic views but cold. We also did a lot of shopping this day :$ Other recommendations would be to visit Juniors Cheesecakes in Central Terminal (I thought the cheesecake here beat the Magnolia Bakery cupcakes that are often raved about), Central Library, The Oyster Bar (a pint and 6 oysters for $12- unusual but nice), Famous Dave's BBQ (the ribs and shrimp were fantastic - and cheap. Don't have starters...trust me, you won't fit it all in. We went twice it was that good), Radio City Music Hall, and a Karoake Bar in Times Square (not sure of the name, but entertaining. Don't expect the standard to be similar to UK Karaoke, it was full of Beyonce type singers). We managed to squeeze all that in within our trip, and still have time for cat nap before going out in the night. Obviously we didn't visit everything (museums etc) but we managed to visit all the main sights that have been recommended on trip advisor and fitted our interests). So if you organised and wearing good walking shoes it can be done.

I found that, like many Hilton properties, The Waldorf left something to be desired. The reason for our stay was that I was to be operated on and my parents and I wanted a little bit of luxury and a classic NYC experience to make things better. I live in Manhattan, but wanted to enjoy myself by staying in an iconic hotel. From the very start I was a bit put off. Prior to checking in both my mother and I spoke with booking agents and informed them I was a government employee (city) -the hotel states online that they offer a discounted rate to government personnel. The agents responded by saying that all I must do is show them my ID at time of check-in and they would apply the rate. Upon checking in we were told that this was not the case and arrangements had to be made when booking the room. The woman at the desk went to talk to her supervisor, however the individual refused to accommodate us. I wasn't upset because we were not able to receive a lesser rate, but was upset that we were misinformed. We found our room to be comfortable (bedding especially), however, a bit dingy and lacking good temperature control. A knob on our dresser popped off and the screw appeared to be stripped, The mirrored doors to our closet had mismatched and cheapie looking handles. Small details, I know...but ones we noticed! The restaurants were overpriced...even by New York standards. I had a $9 pot of tea at Peacock Alley (which is quite lovely I must admit). In terms of service the doormen and garage attendants were very attentive, and most restaurant staff were very pleasant. I am happy I had a one-time stay here, but know I have no need to come back with all of the other great choices in the city. I'm sure that the rooms in the tower portion of the hotel are quite amazing, but if you are going for the more moderate priced rooms you may be disappointed. If I ever had to host an event I feel this would be a fantastic venue, however for a vacation I feel you can find better .", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Bloomfield, MI", "Title": "\u201cNice but pricey\u201d", "Author": "BelieverMI", "ReviewID": "UR94882097", "Content": "The Waldorf is a beautiful hotel in a great location.

I was very apprehensive on receiving a dumpy old room with no escape since i booked a non-refundable rate. We arrived at the hotel with a doorman opening the cab door. Walked inside and the lobby was kickin' as it was Friday night around 7:30 PM. I was lucky not have to wait in line for longer than a couple minutes to check in. Nice lady greeted me and welcomed me back (last stay Oct. 2001). I had called the day before asking if they could upgrade me to a 1 bedroom suite from my king mini suite and they told me they were fully booked but would try their best. They had assigned me the king mini suite but I pressed for a larger room and she told me nothing was available that would top my room and that they sometimes put Towers guests on the 27th floor. She gave me 2 coupons for full American breakfast for two at Oscar's and 2 coupons for Starbucks drink and pastry for 2. Had to use room key to access rooms after 6 PM. Arrived in room and yes, indeed, it was very nice with two rooms and two bathrooms, but it felt small. The room was very clean and lights were lit up making the room feel very welcoming, however, I could not get over how it felt small. I picked up the phone and called guest services and asked if there was anything else. After about 5 minutes of nothing else, all of a sudden, the lady asked if she could put me on hold while she talked to housekeeping. She came back on the line and said there was a large 1 bedroom luxury suite with boudoir, large sitting room and large bedroom. She said to meet her at the room. We immediately went down there and she came down the hall with 2 new room keys and a smile. We walked in and I was stunned at the size. Large marble foyer, very large sitting room with a fireplace!!, spacious bedroom, large boudior with endless storage space, large bathroom with two separate sinks and lots of counter space, separate tub and shower and commode room and kitchen (dated from the 80s but had fridge, stove, sink, dishwasher, cutting board and lots of counter space). Room was so big that my young kid would not go walking around unless I was with or would follow me around if I went to a different area. I could not believe this. I promptly called guest relations and thanked them. We ordered room service the first night. Food came within 30 minutes. To be honest, it was too expensive for what you got. Portions were a very good size but food was tasteless. Service was excellent. All the staff I encountered during the trip gave top notch service. We received a voicemail on each day of our stay wishing us a great stay and to call if we needed anything. We were in town for a wedding and needed suggestions to kill time during the day for our kid. Concierge gave great recommendations. Now, critiquing the room - furniture style was upper east side NYC. Sofa and matching chair in the room were very old. You could really see the age on those 2 pieces. Other chairs throughout looked more recent. Bed was comfortable. Lots of pillows. Flat screen tvs in bedroom and sitting room. While scrolling channels, I ran into 4 or 5 Arabic channels which I assume they had programmed in when the King of Saudi Arabia and his entourage were at the hotel in November. Breakfast at Oscar's was top notch. Had everything you could imagine. We ran into the housekeeper after breakfast and were able to hang out in the sitting room without feeling like we were in her way while she worked in the bathroom. She even vacuumed and I had not noticed anything highly visible so that was a big plus. The room, overall, felt very clean. Overall, my expectations were exceeded. I didn't have much cash on me but did leave the lady who upgraded us a tip. I found her at the check-in desk when I was leaving and was lucky enough to hand it to her personally. She seemed very appreciative. So basically, I think the lesson to learn here is if you feel your room does not meet your needs, call guest relations and they will do their best to accommodate you if they can and they do so with a smile.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cClassic\u201d", "Author": "NoVaWahoo", "ReviewID": "UR94096156", "Content": "Classic hotel.

The foyer, lobby and lifts are stunning examples of art deco design, so grand they warrant a visit themselves.

There is also nothing wrong with the quality of rooms; beds are comfortable, showers powerful and thick walls provide peace and quiet.

Service is brusque and procedural and not set up to deal with modern issues, such as wifi not working.

But it was more of a let-down. There is nothing romantic, friendly, warm, or exciting about it, but the name. So the location is great. no doubt about it. The staff (except for one lady whose role was hard to define - but she seemed like an \"angel in the lobby - mrs fix-it-all\" - she was brilliant) was very! ordinary. That started with a very rigid and partially even rude process of getting our reservation done. the check-in was more like standing in line at the post office - is this really 5 stars?? the level of friendliness is minimal and the doorman rudely ask for tip. Now, we travel between 8-10 times on leisure per year, and tipping in different countries is no stranger to us. Yet, asking for is so bluntly, whilst he didn't even hail down the cab for us (we had to do that ourselves) is just not what you'd expect of \"The Waldorf\" - in the end, I have to say, it's just another very ordinary Hilton hotel - not worth the money they take of you. The A/C in the room is hard to manage and totally outdated, the rooms are big & spacious - that was nice. Breakfast in the Lobby Restaurant was very ordinary and service was slow. The hostess seems to float on a cloud of Ego....not sure she understands service quality and that the guest actually pays her salary. The 2nd breakfast option was literally laughable....it's a cheap-charly buffet version that you'd expect in a 3-star hotel; Compared to other 5-star hotel breakfasts, this was a disappointment and we opted to not eat in the hotel at all for the rest of our stay. The bar is fairly nice & barmen seem to know what they are doing. The best part however was the super-cheap approach by \"Ms sales woman\" as my husband was waiting for me. Her smile didn't stop as she tried to sell!!! right after our arrival, some Hilton Card. - You'd expect that on a bazar in Morroco, but certainly not in the lobby of a 5-star hotel. Very cheap approach. The washrooms in the public areas are guarded by staff which is super unfriendly and rude. Obviously the hotel is used 50% as a tourist attraction and there is no security or anyone that would allow the guest a bit of privacy. It's an \"all walk in, walk around, hang around in the lobby\" feeling. - A smaller hotel gives you more the feeling of a welcome guest, than this corporate institution. Hindsight - it'd been worthwhile paying a bit more on the anyways exorbitant price and stay at the Plaza.

We are used to upgrades, and being treated really well as loyal guests of the Hilton chain. This came to a halting stop at the Waldorf Astoria. Yes, the lobby is grand, beautiful, festive, historic...etc. The staff, however, is incredibly rude, nonchalant, and cannot be bothered by the lowly like of those who would have the audacity to pay a *gasp* advanced purchase rate. You'd think a hotel would appreciate the fact that a guest would pay 100% up front, ensuring they will have that room sold, but instead, at check-in we were met with this exact phrase, \"I see you are a diamond member, but since you paid the advanced purchase rate, you will have to use Starbucks coupons for breakfast.\" Now, I know that a Starbucks coupon is appealing to 99% of the population, but when you are used to full hot breakfast, and they are parading people past the most extravagant buffet you've ever seen, it is a slap in the face to offer someone a cup of coffee and a doughnut that I couldn't even use because of food allergies. The line alone at Starbucks (sometimes 45 minute wait) makes this more of a punishment that a perk. We inquired about an upgrade, but were also informed that \"Europeans are willing to pay for the suites around Christmas, so they wouldn't be available.\" Why even say that? Just state that they are unavailable. Why say you are \"upgrading us to a nice superior room,\" when that is exactly what we paid for? The whole check-in process was condescending, rude, and was set up to make the guests feel defeated...guess I should have packed the fur coat. Once we finished the check in, we went up to our room, which was nice enough. There was the weirdest plug-in fireplace thing from I would guess the 1960's. The wall paper is pealing everywhere, the room was musty, and there was dust...a lot of dust. The beds were great. The soaps and lotions smelled great. Housekeeping was fabulous. The honking and sirens 24/7 kept some of us awake at night. We were on the 15th floor, and it was very loud! Our room was cold...very cold, even when the heat was turned up to 75, the heater just blew cold air and the windows are not insulated. The room service charges are insane (a cheese pizza would cost $55 after all of the fees, service charges, and taxes), so we passed it up. We were here during the blizzard, everything was closed, and we were starving, and Peacock Alley wouldn't even let us order Creme Brulee and take it up to our room. All in all, this hotel is a Hilton hotel in need up serious TLC.

The hotel itself is quite beautiful, you cannot dispute that. The lobby is festive and quite a place to take a picture. You almost might feel as though you are on the Titanic it is that nice. The entire check-in process is a production but when I say this I am one would think it is like a bad broadway play. It took over 20 minutes to get situated valeting the car and giving the bell captain our bags. It was chaos and disorganized. After that, it took over 25 minutes to check in at the front desk. There is not really a section alerting guests where to form a line, the process is slow and reception is understaffed. Once checked in, it took an additional 40 minutes to get our bags, a far cry from the 15 minutes promised. Don't over promise and under deliver especially when on a schedule... Our initial room was small (as can be expected) and had a nice bathroom. They do not use a/c in the winter but will open the window. Nobody ever came to open the window. When we called back, someone then brought us a fan. Our fan did not work. Our desk sparked electrical outlets sparked, shutting down power to that entire portion of the room which included the internet, lamp. This over plugged outlet was on top of a fancy drapery. Given the above all building up within the first 2 hours of our stay, aggrevation began to sit in and this resulted in a room change and upgrade. We started to bring our bags up to the room ourselve rather then wait an additional 30 minutes for someone to come help. The upgraded room was much larger with a private changing room and larger bathroom with barrel ceiling on the corner. I could not complain about the room as it was beautiful and in line with expectations one would have for the Waldorf. We did not utilize some of the hotel's features given we were sightseeing in NYC often. The housekeeping staff refused to come into the room and was discourteous to us and just laughed in another language to our co-worker. The hotel bar service was quite good and packed with interesting characters. The drinks were good. My advice, do not use Hilton Honor points in conjunction with a paying stay. They cannot seem to link reservations properly, our cards did not work after the first night and we never received an itemized bill. On our check out date we actually received a blank bill which did not even provide charges from previous night or an overview of the charged incurred for items such as room service. I am dreading going back to reception to finalize my bill as a broadway show is amazing, just not at the Waldorf. At this level and based on their boutique pricing, whether or not you get a deal or not, if your goal is to have a seamless hassle-free experience in a historic well known hotel, I'd recommend staying at the Plaza Hotel and or trying one of the many other boutique hotels in NYC. Would I give the hotel a second chance? Perhaps but only if it were not on my dime or some amazing deal came around... But in NY, time is money and wasted time with extra headaches costs money. I would rather stay at a standard Hilton, take my chances and save money and at least get consistent service and less headaches. Overall, I have found service to be more delightful at Hilton's Anatole in Dallas, Hilton's Research Triangle \"Mansion on the Hill\" or even a random Hampton Inn on the side of an interstate. You can always take your picture in the beautiful lobby. Some of the staff we encountered gave 110%, others however, you would think they hated their jobs and were giving 50% at best.

When we arrived in the evening of 23rd November at 7:30 after a long trip we were told that we did not have a room as a corporate client had decided to extend his stay and took over 90% of the rooms. I went ballistic and told them that I had a CONFIRMED booking. They offered to transfer us to the Marriot Marquise and reinburse us 1 night. I said it was not good enough, eventually after a long argument my wife said we should take the deal, but I said I also want a free meal out of them, which I got. We were then asked to follow someone to a waiting \"Limo\" to take us to the Marquise, and I was expected to carry my own bags, whoa, all stop, I am not going to carry my bags, get someone to it. Eventually there was a porter. We were then driven to the Marquise and the driver told us it was the King of Saudi Arabia who had taken our rooms. We did not realise that the Marquise was located in Times Square. Hold on, this is not the type of area we want to stay in, so we got the driver to take us back to the Waldorf. I then told them on the desk that we wanted a room, we had paid for one and we had a confirmation and we were not going anywhere else. The clerk then went into a back room and after a few minutes she came back and said they had one. Why did we go through this charade if they had a room after all? The room was very average and in need of a refurb, not what I expect in a 5star hotel, the toilet in the bathroom looked like it needed a good clean. There was no way of turning the heating off and it got too hot and had to sleep with the window open. The bed was comfortable and the room was adequate, but not 5star. We were woken the next morning at 9am by the sounds of hammer drills in the hotel. We took advantage of the free meal in the Bull and Bear which was very nice, the Maitre D was very good but the waiters were VERY average, my wife had her plate removed before she had finished. The meal was overpriced but we were not paying for it. We were waiting by the entrance to leave one day any 2 doormen were having a shouting match in which one was moaning he had been \"shafted\".

We reserved several Waldorf suites and a few additional rooms last July. On the day we were departing for New York, we called the hotel to cancel one of the rooms, after my mother decided not to go on the trip. My husband was put \"on hold\" for a long time; then a Waldorf manager came on to tell him we no longer had rooms at the hotel. A large party, he said, had extended their stay. We would not be accommodated; for us, there were No Rooms At The Inn. We were effectively kicked out, after planning and looking forward to this week at the Waldorf for months. No amount of reasoning with them helped. We asked them to re-check our history with the hotel - we had actually just been there a week-and-a-half earlier. We are seasoned travelers and had never, ever, been treated like this anywhere in the world. So we wondered: Were they being up-front with us? Did a group really extend? Or were the bedbugs we'd been hearing about taking over a hotel wing? Was Obama visiting? Prince Charles? Had they read my new parenting book (I'm an author) and not liked it? We were mystified. They made arrangements for us to stay at their sister hotel: the New York Hilton. They offered to pay for a night (we negotiated a few more) but it was just not the same. The Hilton - adequate though it is, is more than a few steps down in quality from the Waldorf. What's more, the hotel gave us virtually no notice. Remember - we'd phoned them. They clearly were not planning to spring this news upon us until we checked in, very late at night, with young children in tow. Where was their ethics? Their loyalty? Their revered style and service? And why have we not heard from them since? Somewhere, the Hilton family is weeping (Paris excluded). Maybe one day, we will find out the true reason for this egregious exile.

I had previously stayed there with my mum in Feb 06 and was keen to see if the place had changed at all. First, the location of this hotel cannot be beaten if you are looking to be within walking distance of shops, good restaurants and many of the sights. The subway on Lex and 51st will get you to places further afield. Second, all of the staff that we interacted with were very helpful, courteous and friendly - particularly the lady who manned the safety deposit boxes. Third, this is a lovely traditional grand hotel with a jaw-dropping lobby and reception to die for (even the ladies toilets are grand!). Plus, the rooms are large! We would return to the Waldorf and may well do so on our next trip to NY. It's a good hotel, but a few tweaks would make it a great hotel. Some minor grumbles below. When we arrived, it was very busy (rush hour too, it took about 2 hours to get from JFK in the cab). Owing to the traffic, the cab driver dropped us at the front entrance rather than entering through the designated entrance for cars and cabs. Fortunately as we only had 1 case between us, this wasn't a problem, but if we had been travelling with more luggage, we would have struggled to get it through the revolving doors and then up the stairs and into the lobby. Of course, this wasn't the fault of the hotel, but I fail to see why they cannot have somebody on hand to alert the bellhops if guests do enter via the main doors...surely they might require assistance with luggage too?! Check-in was very speedy, which we appreciated, since we just wanted to get to our room, freshen up and get out and about. There certainly seemed to be a more hurried feel to the entire experience this time around as compared to 2006, although to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt, this could be because we stayed there in the very busy period running up to Thanksgiving. On top of that, there were all manner of private events being hosted there, in addition to a wedding in the lobby area of the hotel on the Saturday. This didn't cause us any problem at all, although the letter posted under our door would have been better received the night before rather than at some point during the late morning on the day of the event! We had already left the hotel before the letter was placed under our door and knew that a wedding was probably going to take place in the lobby as there was a team of florists setting up an enormous archway made entirely of pink and white roses, right over the steps to the lobby! The location of the wedding meant that hotel guests could not access the main lobby from the Park Ave entrance, but rather had to walk through the hotel, take a lift or the stairs to lobby level from the Lex Ave side, then through reception back towards the Park Ave lifts. Again, a minor inconvenience, but if you are planning to stay at this hotel, be aware that these private functions are quite regular. Which is why I would have thought that the letters or notices could have been posted a lot earlier. On both occasions I have stayed here, the rooms have been of a very good size. The sheets are nice and clean and the feather mattress toppers make you feel nice and cosy. The bathroom sizes vary; on the latest occasion, I would say that the bathroom was about double the size of that of the previous room. This time around we also had a separate secluded entrance to our room, which was rather nice. The rooms are cleaned to a good standard every day. I would rate cleanliness at 4 and a half stars only because on this occasion, I noticed quite a bit of dust built up on the bedside table during our stay. That said, the rest of the room was spotless and there was no dust there when we arrived. The Waldorf claims to provide all guests with a nightly turndown service, but this seemed a little sporadic. Each night I stayed in 2006, upon return to my room at approximately 8pm, the bed had been turned down, music was playing (!) and the bedside light was on. On this occasion, on some nights the bed was not turned down at all (although the room had been cleaned and the bed made etc), while on one of the 5 nights we stayed, we indeed experienced the full turndown service. No criticism of the staff - the maids seemed to be there morning, noon and night. However, I feel that the service should either be provided fully or not at all. Personally, I don't require a turndown service but others might be disappointed if the service is sporadic. As other reviewers have noted, not all rooms at the Waldorf have a safe, so do ask upon check-in. Again, this was a minor inconvenience and in fact the lady who generally manned the safety deposit boxes was lovely and friendly, always greeting us with a smile first thing in the morning. Dining in the hotel can be pricey, so be prepared. We didn't eat in the hotel on this occasion (too busy sampling the meatballs at The Meatball Shop (84 Stanton Street - GO THERE!!) for that. However, I have previously eaten here and the food was good, though expensive. As other reviewers have said, there is a Starbucks in the entrance of the hotel (would have thought not the image that the Waldorf would want to portray, but no matter). Don't bother buying from there unless you are desperate, do yourself a favour and if it must be Starbucks, visit the one on the corner of 51st and Lex. It's about half the price and right around the corner from the hotel. We have both stayed in other hotels in New York but we like the Waldorf for the size of its rooms, the staff and the location. This is not a hip and trendy hotel by any means, but it doesn't need to be.

The hotel is everything you would expect of a world famous brand. The room was bright and reasonably roomy with quality fittings and the most comfy bed I have ever had in a hotel. Part of the Waldorfs appeal is its art deco finishings & our bathroom was finished in beautiful marble. The lobby area itself is something to see itself with its soaring ceilings & ornate chandileers. Of course as you would expect the customer service was exceptional.

I do not understand why they do not give up the Hilton name since they have such a problem being associated with Hilton. They do have a great Sunday Brunch. Most Hiltons treat Diamond members very well but after our 3rd visit to this hotel we have decided to avoid returning. No upgrades or complimentary breakfast unlike the Hilton New York where they have created a special area for diamond members. It is a shame that our America Hiltons are doing so badly. When we go to Europe, we are upgraded to the Executive Level where drinks are free (nobody abuses it) and they have a great afternoon tea if you happen to be around and not enjoying playing tourist. One has to wonder how the Europeans and British feel when they visit our country and the executive rooms are non-existent or provide the minimum service and hours. Certainly no upgrade to the executive level at the Waldorf. Again we love the location but really did not feel welcome, rather felt like our Diamond status counted against us. I guess they receive too many diamond members so we are a bother - one would think that would make them realize how much business diamond members bring in.

We were so excited to get to stay at the Waldorf=Astoria; that is until we woke up on Wednesday morning to discover that there was no hot water. The hotel had left letters at the registration desk noting that Con Edison, the utilities provider in NYC had informed them that due to a steam leak, the steam supply to the hotel would be shutdown between 11:55PM Tuesday and 6:00AM Wednesday. I woke up at 7:00AM Wednesday and tried to get in the shower. After calling the front desk, I remembered the letter. I was informed that the hot water should be back on by 8:00AM. I waited until then. I tried again to get into the shower around 8:20AM, and when there was no hot water, I went ahead and dressed without showering. Shortly thereafter, my husband noted that the hot water was on, so I went ahead and showered. I spoke to the Director of Group Services, Ana Tijan, about what happened. She infomed me that this was not something that the hotel had any control over; however, she kindly offered me a credit to the hotel to compensate my family for the trouble. She went on to offer my children each a Waldorf chef and bellman bear. This made my children very happy. We were very thankful and appreciative that they took our complaint seriously, and addressed the matter in a manner which was acceptable to both parties. After this, the remainder of our stay was very enjoyable. Everyone on the staff, from Sara with the safety deposit boxes to Mina and Jonathan at the Concierge's desk, was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend, and if I am ever blessed to return to NYC, I would be glad to stay again at this historic hotel.

On Sunday mornings, the main lobby is virtually a construction site all morning setting up for the Sunday brunch. Can't find anywhere else to do that? The hotel's apparent answer to midday eating is Oscar's, which really has absolutely no appeal and not only has the bar been closed (for whatever reason), it looks abandoned in place with empty shelves (save cleaning items and random junk). On a Sunday morning (as in this morning), there apparently is exactly one place to get a cup of coffee in the entire hotel, and that is the Starbucks take out kiosk in the lower level off the lobby. At any given time, Starbucks was 20 or more people deep, and as I said is take-out only. Part of the reason for this is that those with Hilton Honors status are given vouchers for \"continental breakfast\" in lieu of concierge lounge service (2200 rooms and W=F can't find space for a lounge?)

We left our luggage and went out for lunch, but our room was still not available when we returned at 2:30pm. Since check-in is not actually until 3pm, this wasn't a big deal, but I can't imagine that there wasn't a single room available for us 30 minutes early. However, by 3pm our room still wasn't ready. We were becoming impatient by this point. How could this be? The hotel has around 27 floors and there wasn't a single room available at check-in time? The lady at the front desk was very nice and gave us each a voucher for a free drink at the bar, then called us 10 minutes later to tell us our room was finally ready. We were given room 913, which was an upgraded room with a corner view and a dressing room. Very nice! Our luggage was brought up just a few minutes after we arrived, so no complaints there. However, the heating did not work and there was a very strange odor in the dressing room that grew worse throughout our stay. On our way out to dinner, we mentioned the heating to the staff at the front desk and was also going to mention the smell, but when I told them that I had forgotten to take the 'Privacy' notice off the door they said they wouldn't enter the room. Oh, well. We were in a rush to leave and since we were only going to be there one night there wasn't much point in forcing the issue. I'm sure if we had mentioned it there wouldn't have been a lot that could have been done, given their apparent shortage of rooms.

The W=A and Hilton certainly make this hotel out to be on par with other luxury hotels and are even using this property to spur a brand. However, if you have any desire for service, well appointed accommodations or expect any better treatment due to your brand loyalty....look elsewhere! The lobby is nice...historic...the rooms...are seriously bad. Our room reeked like dampness and mold and was masked with some potpourri/flowery scent. I can appreciate historic details but the shower, tub, casing about the shower was full of dust and hair and just disgusting. Trying to connect to the internet is almost impossible (wired, of course) and everything is just very....\"preserved.\" As a diamond member, it went totally unrecognized during my stay. No upgrade...the \"free breakfast\" i'm supposed to receive was instead rewarded with a gift certificate to Starbucks in the lobby. Seriously? The W=A sends you to Starbucks for a coffee and muffin to it's most loyal customers? It's just so tacky. I also was given 2 free water bottles from the mini-bar as a diamond member. I checked my HH accout today and was charged $73 and then another for $17 for mini-bar charges. I called the hotel, was put on hold, then transferred to accounting, put on hold again....then told that I probably moved \"everything around\" in the mini bar and that's why i got charged. It's laughable that they call this luxury. I didn't move anything and even if I did- they shouldn't be so quick to put $90 on someone's credit card after checkout without even asking. The accountign girl said...\"this happens all the time...' So...I wonder how many people out there are getting robbed by the W-A NYC. She reversed the charge, but it was a 15 minute ordeal...and not my fault. This stay was supposed to be special- and as one of the top properties in the Hilton brand- somewhere you want to go to use the points you earn. But because thsi place is such a let down...i'm seriously thinking of switching to being loyal to Starwood next year. Just think...I could have used Starwood points and been at The St. Regis vs. The Waldorf....and the St. Regis is on par with other luxury properties in the city.....(and the Plaza is spectacular).

What choice did I have?... Then I read the reviews here, and my heart really sank, so I went there ready for a fight and ready for a huge disappointment but had a blast! First of all, a quick tip - order the Super Shuttle online before you leave, order a round trip to and from the airport and add the tip. Believe me, you will thank me! Saves time and money. Then, I got to the hotel at midnight, my mom got here before me, and it was all great. We stayed in room 883 (not in the towers), and it was fantastic. Don't expect a nice view (our window overlooked the W hotel) because this is New York City - all you see around you are sky scrapers.

The only annoying thing was that after 6pm you need to use your room key to operate the elevator, but three out of the five elevators wouldn't accept our room cards, so we had to call the concierge and they fixed it. The other thing was that the hotel is expensive, period, so we couldn't eat breakfast or dinner there, and even the strabucks at the hotel was at least a dollar more per cup than any other starbucks,but since there are two around the corner from the hotel, we didn't mind. My mom had to put her diabetic shots in the mini bar, so we told them ahead of time so they won't charge us, and they offered to bring a fridge up for us.

II would venture to say that the carpet hasn't been upgraded in 20 years. The corridors are not lit well and kind of scary. You have to use your key card to access the elevator (I thought this was a 5-star hotel?). The room was a complete let down. I had a reservation for 5 nights and left after one. Here's why: 1. The internet in the room didn't work. They actually have a personal Cisco wireless router in each room. Is this a dorm room? Really? You have to find your room # in the list of 30+ wireless networks. Mine did not work. They also have the old school wired connection as well. That didn't work either. It wasn't just me; one of my colleagues stayed here and couldn't get internet access either. 2. The room itself hasn't been upgraded in some time. That would be fine if it was in good shape but it wasn't. The paint was chipping in the bathroom, the desk had several nicks on it and the room is very dark. The bathroom is really small and has a weird medicine cabinet. Maybe this was the trend in the 40's? 3. HBO kept going in and out on the TV. Not a huge deal but it was a Sunday night and I love True Blood! 4. No coffee maker in the room. I have come to expect this in most hotels at this point. Even the Ritz and Four Seasons has them. 5. This wasn't anything that negatively affected me, but they actually have a dress code posted when you walk into the hotel. Who do they think they're kidding? The hotel is in terrible shape. It was a joke. If it was super posh and deluxe, fine, but it wasn't. Don't stay here. They have a respected name and they're banking on it.

To make a long story short, myself and two friends splurged on what we thought would be a luxury hotel stay two years ago and we were greatly disappointed in our stay, specifically the dated and tired room we were assigned that had fallen into great disrepair. We all complained in writing and were each given a complimentary stay in a \"Luxury Suite\". I stayed again once last year using my complimentary stay and then last month I returned with my same two friends for two nights using their complimentary stays. For this, I am very greatful. I honestly do appreciate the fact that I have just stayed in a suite at no cost to myself or my travelling companions however the fact remains, this hotel is old, overpriced and requires MAJOR renovations. I have stayed in 4 different rooms in this hotel, from basic to what they deem \"luxury\" and the need for significant upgrades has existed in each of them. The bathrooms are like stepping back into the 60's or 70's with any upgrades that have been done being done cheaply and quite some time ago. The carpeting in the rooms is worn and dirty. The air conditioning systems are ancient, the paint is peeling off the walls, furnishings outdated, you name it, it needs to be updated. In addition to the fact that the place needs a major overhaul, The Waldorf Astoria gouges its customers on the extras. In room internet access is an exorbitant $20 per day and I would never recommend ording room service as the food is disappointing and ridiculously overpriced. Try spending $30 on a club sandwich and a beverage! On this most recent trip to the Waldorf I drove to New York City instead of flying. Parking at the hotel is astronomical at $60 a day. I was LESS than impressed when my vehicle was returned to me after having been parked in what must have been a construction zone. It was absolutely covered in a powdery white dust (which I can only assumed was from concrete being chiselled and broken apart near to where my vehicle must have been parked). The stuff was hardened to the paint and somehow managed to make its way to the INTERIOR as well...all over the dash board, seats etc. I take very good care of my car and expect when paying $60 a day for parking that so does the Waldorf. There was no time to complain about this at the time as when your car is returned to you, there is little time to leave it sitting idle without blocking others from getting out of the garage. All in all, I would not recommend anybody stay here. Your hard earned money can be much better spend elsewhere and there are many more affordable NICER options in the New York City Area.

When we spoke to the receptionist she said we could have an upgrade due to our Hilton Honors status but we would have to wait till the following day as they were full due to it being Mothers Day. Our new room on the same floor (26th) was huge. We had a separate living area, 2 bathrooms, a large bedroom with a separate wardrobe area and 2 tvs! The mini bar was due to be replaced so it didnt work but they sent us a fridge up to our room to use for our drinks! We got the use of the free breakfast buffet in the morning until 10.30 am but this was usually busy and tables were limited. We could also use the lounge to get coffee, tea and water from 12 til 4pm. All the staff were very helpful especially the concierge who booked restaurants for us. The rooms were very clean and we even got a turndown service in the evening. Some of the decor was slightly jaded but this is a classic hotel with a lot of character and history about it so a few scuff marks here and there is nothing. It was noisy at night even on the 26 floor but that was police and fire sirens. My only problem was and this is common in most US hotels is there is no tea/coffee making facilities (except for the free lounge for our floor) The lifts were usually empty and very quick. We had great views from our room too. As it was my birthday by hubbie arranged for a cake which was sent up to our room on my birthday and was delicious. They also sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne and some little chocolates which was a nice touch. My husband also booked some flowers throught the hotel which were beautiful. It was also our anniversary on our trip and we got a complimentary bottle of red wine too. The hotel is in a great location- just far enough from Times Square for it not to be too noisy. Althought there are thousands of cabs in the city it can be difficult to get a cab at night. The doorman will flag one down but give plenty of time for dinner reservations especially if the weather is bad as a lot of cabs dont stop. There are a few unsolicited 'luxury' cabs which stop outside the hotel but I wouldnt recommend these to be safe. There is wifi in the rooms but you have to pay so use the reception area which is free. There is a limo service at the hotel which we booked before hand that picked us up from the airport (even though we were delayed by 2 hours) and took us back to the airport. There are 4 resturants and a bar in the hotel so you are spoilt for choice (especially the Bull and Bear which serves excellent food. There is a business centre which you have to pay for but there is 1 computer set up to allow you to check in to flights on line for free and print out your boarding passes.

This hotel on the other hand received 3 stars, and that's only because of how beautiful the lobby was, how clean the rooms were, and the incredibly friendly bellman who greeted us. Other than that, it's definitely not worth the $300something per night that we paid. The rooms were very tiny and nothing about it stands out. I'm still trying to get over the fact that I paid over $300 a night to sleep in a little box, where even the bathroom door showed its old age. Instead of replacing a very old door, what they did was constantly paint it over year after year after year. Now what you have left is an incredibly old bathroom door with thick layers of cream colored paint. The headboards on the bed were old and cheap looking, and the carpet in the room needs an upgrade. It was nice saying that I stayed at the Waldorf in New York City, but I honestly don't think I'll be paying this hotel a visit anytime soon, nor do I recommend it, especially if you plan on staying in one of their standard size rooms.

The grand entryway is beautiful and leads to the main hallway which holds the historic clock. Staff was very helpful. We didn't get the room size and bed request we had on the reservation, but staff worked hard to find a replacement which was a downgrade from our original selection.

The furniture and fixtures in the bathroom look like they have been there for years however the fixtures and furniture were still good.

On reaching check-in, we were immediately offered an alternate option, that being all of our hotel costs would be covered if we moved over the block to Days Inn, a 2 star hotel (a sister hotel to the Waldorf). This was because a conference had over-run. Now we did not book the Waldorf to stay in a 2 star sister hotel across the road, so not clear why we were asked. I am also a Hilton Gold Card holder, so they would have known my preferences. However for refusing to move to Days Inn we were allocated a very small dingy room at the back of the hotel, with a tiny bathroom, which was many years old. Single glazed windows, so cold air blowing in. Not what we expected at all. The following morning my wife complained and we were offered a bigger room, on the corner of the hotel. Again the bathroom was very dated, the windows did not fit, and I know for the money we were paying we could have got much much better deal in New York (I had been to NYC a few times before). The hotel itself is prohibitively expensive to eat or drink in, you can cross the road and get the same cup of coffee at at one tenth of the price. Sadly its a hotel that has a great lobby that really takes ones breath away when you enter, once you are past that, it is very much all down hill - which is such a shame. The hotel has seen better days and is need of a refurbishment and to make the rooms and the bathrooms much more up to date.

We went for a long weekend over Easter, so I guess it would have been an extremely busy time of the hotel calendar ,however we found the service to be very, very impersonal. The doormen 'underground' when we arrived in our limo were not too welcoming - pretty abrupt to be honest. We had to find our own way up to reception and when we got there, we had to queue for ages to check in - v frustrating with 2 young kids after a transatlantic journey. We were assigned our rooms and given our keys and left to get on with it - nothing was explained to us about where to go for breakfast and at what time etc - we had to come back and queue up again later to ask that. We also were not advised that they had removed all the mini-bars from the rooms for updating - we found that out ourselves when we got there. Trying to speak to the concierge also involved a lengthy wait and even then we didn't find her particularly forthcoming. Our room (an Astor Suite on the 19th floor ) was gorgeous though - yes, old fashioned , but absolutely in keeping with the hotel and I didn't feel it was at all 'tired'. It was v spacious and the views out of our 5 ( yes 5!) windows were amazing. However, we could have done with the mini bar, Wi-Fi ( I think all decent hotels should offer this now ) and a children's channel on the TV ( couldn't believe that with all the channels in the US, they couldn't even give us one free kid's network - you had to pay for anything remotely cartoonish). Despite being so high up, the noise at night from outside was unbearable - constant car horns and sirens. I'm assuming it's like that wherever you stay in New York? I didn't sleep a wink the 1st night - takes getting used to I guess! The hotel inself internally though was very quiet - ie no disturbance from other guests/doors slamming/toilets flushing etc. We had breakfast in Oscar's each day and I have to say that was fantastic. The food was fabulous and the staff in there were absolutely brilliant - they even waived charging the children to eat which was unexpected and highly appreciated. In a nutshell - the hotel itself is absolutely as gorgeous as I had imagined and I loved just wandering around, taking it all in. Location and price are outstanding but I'm not sure if I would go back there though - I have seen it /done it if you know what I mean, so if I ever returned to NYC I think I would prefer to pay a little more and stay somewhere that we were made to feel like actual appreciated guests rather than a number in a line. That being said, I did enjoy my stay there and I'm glad I finally realised a long standing wish..

Spirits can only be purchased by the bottle so unless you are a beer drinker or want to drink half a bottle of wine room service is not really an option. The room service they did give was indeed first class. No tea or coffee making facilities in the room so if you wanted a hot drink between 6 am and 6 pm a trip to Starbucks in the lobby was a bit of a chore and a bit costly.

The room was upgraded to one in the Towers and was very nice. The staff was helpful at check-in and in guiding us through the building; my mom and I both have mobility issues. We dropped my mom and daughter back at the hotel at about 10:30 pm only to get a call from my daughter shortly thereafter telling me that there was a pile of excrement on the carpet next to the garbage can! I called Guest Services and the person was appropriately apologetic and said she would look into it; I gave her my number and 2 hours later, still no call. I called again, and spoke to the same person. She said housekeeping had cleaned up, and they were \"looking into what happened.\" I pointed out that she had not called me back as promised and also that I had wasted about 30 plus minutes on hold and on hang-ups trying to find out what was going on. They offered my mom a free breakfast, which she turned down. Finally, they said they would offer me a voucher for a future night's stay. When I said we weren't excited about staying there given what had happened and asked for a credit for the night's stay, they refused, with some incomprehensible claim about not being able to do so because of the credit card companies. This morning, there was no bill left in the room and more confusion around check-out. I called again and was told that the hotel would email the statement to me. Surprise--no email arrived. So I had to call again this evening, wait on hold, and tell two different people the story in order to get the statement successfully emailed. For an over $300 per night room, this was way more trouble than it was worth.

We were extremely disappointed as we had booked a Double Deluxe- wether this was 'standard' in the scheme of things I dont know but what we arrived to was a let down. We expected 2 standard sized double beds , but got what appeared to be 2 large singles. there was No Way my husband and I were going to experience a comfortable 3 nights !! I phoned reception straight away who were obviously niggled by my complaint but nevertheless did what they could to find us a better room, which they did. it was indeed a far superior room, but still 'frayed round the edges' ie-the air conditioning/ heating system didnt work properly, and the view was pretty awful. Ive actually been in low budget hotels that have been in better 'fresher' condition . The hotels location for us could have been better, as it was a bit far from most attractions [ a 15/20 min walk] but with the weather being pretty bad I suppose that made our walk feel worse. We didnt choose to have Breakfast as we discovered it was outrageously overpriced , but being English I was desperate to have my first morning cuppa.I looked at the Room service menu that priced ONE cup of tea at $8 !! Well, I still had one [which seemed to take ages to come] but went on to find when we checked out that, it did , in fact come to $18!!! I phoned immediately in disgust , and the patronising response was that it was 'service charge and VAT ON TOP !!!! Again most of my Hotel stays have had Tea and Coffee making Facilities already in the room, why not this one???? Not having breakfast did though have its downfall, we couldnt find anywhere in the immediate vacinity that did breakfasts!! we actually had to walk about 20 minutes before finding a reasonable restaurant that wasnt a Starbucks or Costa Coffee. Its been mentioned a few times about this Hotel but I will reiterate that The Waldorf really shouldnt use its Historical past as an excuse to continue charging ridiculous prices.

It was a stunning location, from our experience of seeing both ends of the scale I would definately say that the hotel may fall below your expectations if you have one of thier standard rooms if our first room was a fair reflection of that.

Check-in had a bit of a line, although the manager was quick to come and apologize (as apparently a convention was in town). Still not too bad of a wait (about 5 minutes). Was quickly given our room keys and up we went. I've stayed at the Waldorf-Astoria back in Jan. 2006, and this time instead of staying in a mini-suite, we booked the one-bedroom suite. The room was still had its classic red and gold charm. I will say that it was good to see that the TV's were now flat screens (back when I had been there they were still old TVs from the 90s), and that things had been renovated a bit. The bathroom is small and only one person will probably fit in there at a time (the only issue I've ever had with the Waldorf). It was supposed to snow that evening, and it was great finding out that we had a huge terrace all to ourselves that was already full of snow. There was an entrance to the terrace from both the living room and bedroom, which was very nice. Turn down service was nice, nothing I can really complain about... Went up to security at about midnight asking him where a good place to eat was...he did not disappoint and gave us places to eat that the locals went to as opposed to the usual tourist traps. Also, the best hot dog vendor in all of New York (that I know of) has his stand on the corner across the street from the hotel (in front of the church). He's there until 5am...so you should be able to get as many hot dogs as you want. The only thing I really had an issue with was when we checked out and went to get a cab. The doormen on the Waldorf Towers side got us a cab and helped us with our luggage, but wouldn't close my boyfriends door and just stood there. It took us a second to realize that he was standing there waiting for a tip! No hotel staff member has ever done that before. We didn't mean to try and go without tipping him (but we were rushing to the airport and had other things on our mind), but found it a bit rude that he would just stand there waiting.

The service is fantastic, and despite the constant bustle and activity in the foyers and reception areas, there is always someone around to help and offer advice on everything from booking a babysitter, to places to visit. The prices in the bars and restaurants were quite expensive, as expected, but the service and atmosphere were excellent. We booked an evening babysitting service prior to our trip, using an agency which the hotel concierge recommended to us. This allowed us to go to one of the hotel's restaurants whilst the children were cared for in the room for a few hours. Don't be afraid to complain however, if you consider that you have been fobbed off with a poor room. We thought we had booked the room rated above standard (possibly deluxe), but we were shown to a broom cupboard, with mould on one of the walls and thick dust on the skirting boards. We rang reception, who immediately \"upgraded\" us without any fuss, to a larger and much more pleasant room.

The short corridor on the other side of our door led round to a stylish bathroom with bath and roomy shower, a walk in wardrobe with ironing board, safe, lots of hangers and suitcase stands, then finally came the opulently decorated room with fantastic view over the city towards the river and antique furniture adding an atmosphere of grand country hotel. I love staying in good hotels and this will be put on my list of favourites, together with the De Tuilerieen in Bruges, Ritz Carlton in Berlin and the Inn at Whitewell in the Trough of Bowland. Breakfast was on floor 26 and continental, with smoked salmon and lots of fresh fruit and pastries, though the Sunday brunch looked wonderful, if expensive. My teenaged daughter was impressed by the idea of a chocolate fountain and the cakes looked wonderful; works of art fit for MOMA. Staff were friendly throughout our stay and the housekeeper even showed us a palatial room she was just finishing cleaning before new guests arrived, which looked fabulous. We had a late flight out of Newark back to the UK and the hotel looked after our luggage, leaving us to relax and notifying us when the suitcases were next to the cab they'd ordered at our request.

At the front desk I asked if it was possible to have an upgrade but no, according to the manager the hotel was completely booked. When I arrived at my room, it was very small and looked just like any other hotel room, I am extremely sad to say. A view of another building, and right next to the elevator. I assumed they saved the 'bad' rooms for Hilton Hhonors guests. The carpet had a horrendous moldy odor, and the light switch and doorbell were literally haning off the wall, which is at the least unsightly and at the most a fire hazard. When I called to complain they couldn't offer any solutions. The next morning I asked the concierge where I could get breakfast in the hotel and he informed me that the restaurant had closed. There was a huge breakfast buffet being set up in the lobby behind us. When I queried about that he looked at me dubiously and said, 'Yes but that breakfast is [XX amount] dollars\". How insulting!

It was before I looked for references on TripAdvisor and discovered all the horrible feedback about run-down rooms, rude staff and poor breakfasts. Ever since and until our trip I was looking for alternatives all the time, but failed to find better hotel offering: either prices were substantially more expensive (even for 3* hotels in Manhattan, or the location was much worse. So, we decided to take a risk, even though we knew that on top of everything else by default we will not be offered the best rooms in the range due to our \"deal\" booking. Let me also tell you that I had a chance to stay in many hotels around the world, including many Hilton hotels, so I pretty much know what the 4* or 5* standard should be. We were pleasantly surprised, after all. We were given Deluxe Double King Room on the 8th floor (one of the lower floors in the hotel). The room is very spacious (we did not need so much room in the closets either), the bathroom is OK, the heating system is loud, but it did not disturb as at least for us walking in the city for the entire day allowed very heavy sleep at night. We had a big flat TV and iPod dock - so, no problems with modern touch either (if only we had time to use them on our vacation to NYC). Yes, the overall condition is certainly not first year freshness, but at lesat there is a lot of character as opposed to the majority of other Hilton family hotels. The breakfast was served in Oscar's brasserie, the variety was very good, food delicious and there were no lines ever (as opposed to the top rated London Hilton Tower Bridge, where we stayed on the way to NYC) - so my fears of having to eat my \"Hilton breakfast\" in Starbuck's were unnecessary. Check-in was fast (but we arrived at 1 AM) and I indeed so crowds of people during regular check-in hours: the hotel was 100% booked. Public areas are truly magnificient, especially with Christmas decorations and the staff seemed to be nice (not much interaction as no problems encountered). Location was great - in the very centre, but just a couple of streets away from the crazy Times Square (last time we stayed in Casablanca hotel and experienced Time Square living in full - good and bad:) Yes, avoid Starbucks in the hotel - prices are 30% higher than elsewhere and there is another Starbucks nearby. In summary, for the price we paid this was a very good value, much better than tsimilarly priced 3*-4* TOP rated hotels in Manhattan. I am just For complaining business travellers expecting 5* luxury and absence of tourists in jeans - I would suppose Waldorf Towers can easily offer you this, along with associated price increase. For all other travellers screaming for rapid repairs necessary: yes, the repairs would make the hotel even more beautiful, but then I suppose this hotel would be a direct rival to Plaza, Pierre, etc in terms of everything, prices included.

Throughout our stay (one week) the staff was very nice and efficient and the concierge service was very helpful for booking restaurants or providing information regarding shops and museums.

We had been expecting a very old room (due to certain reviews we had read), but it was not run down at all, it even had a modern flat screen TV. The heating worked very well and the bed was huge and SO comfortable!! The room was definitely a 5 star hotel room. The location of the hotel is really perfect, there are many attractions close by and there is a subway line a few minutes away. The only negative remarks would be the very high price for internet access in the business center (however if you have a laptop, there is free wifi access in the lobby) and room service (over 50 USD for continental breakfast).

The communal areas (eg lobby, toilets, corridors, shops etc) are elegant. The room service food is good (did not venture to the restaurants) and is prompt. The bed / bedding, as well as bathroom soft furnishings are good, as is the iron. Now the not so good: It is pricey, very pricey: from the initial room fee, to the room service, phone calls, internet etc there was nothing that wasn't chargeable.....and by that I mean at an exoribtant cost. There never seemed to be enough staff: there was always a long queue at reception, and we were always put on hold when calling housekeeping or the concierge (but not on the room service, which is not surprising given the room service costs!!!). The room was delapidated to say the least (have the rooms actually been re-decorated since they moved into the building in 1910?) with a TV which didn't really work very well - also the plug sockets were hanging dangerously out of the wall. There was not enough storage space for two people. The room was either warm but incredibly stuffy, or cold - impossible to get a balance between the two, hence difficult to get a good night's sleep. Neither of the plugs in the bathroom wok sufficiently - impossible to have a proper shave or relaxing bath without having the water on permanently (i thought the hotel was on an energy efficiently drive?!) and the shower was lacking in power. The taps in the basin were a bit suspect too - scaldingly hot to freezing. The lighting was very poor in the room - just a series of lamps dotted around - which meant entrance/departure required a tour of the room switching on/off each light - again not very energy efficient as i'm sure most people could not be bothered to do this. The noise from the street (even 14 floors up) was incredible, which also prevented getting a good night's sleep - and if you think there nothing that can be done about it, check out the numerous airport hotels which have complete sound proofing eg Hilton at Heathrow T4). There was no tea / coffee facilities nor a kettle in the room. No complimentary water to drink in the room - the tap water didn't taste great. Overall: if you're old & well past your best, and want a hotel that is too, then this is perfect for you. If you want to get a hotel which is comensurate with the price you pay, go somewhere else, where the rooms will have modern amenities, and have had a coat of paint in the last 100 years. With thousands of hotels in New York, this is not the worst hotel by far, however it's well over-priced, overdue a makeover, and you could stay at a 3 star hotel offering better rooms.", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth", "Title": "\u201cHigh Expectations but Very Disapointing\u201d", "Author": "americanholiday", "ReviewID": "UR52614011", "Content": "Front of house public areas (lobby, bars, shops etc) just divine.

We arrived late on the Sunday evening, checked in and then went down to one of the restaurants in the hotel for a meal which was extremely pricey (as we expected) but some of the restaurant staff were almost to the point of being rude - not the \"unparelled hospitality and service\" promised on the hotels website. On returning back to our room we did notice that it looked a little bit tired but as we wanted to make the most of New York's sights we only really used our room for sleeping and bathing until our last day when we spent some time in the room packing and that was when we started noticing things. For example, the net curtain at the window was flithy, the valances on the bed had holes in and were stained, paint was peeling off in the bathroom, the sealant was hanging off over the bath/shower, the toilet seat was loose (you had to be careful how you positioned yourself when you sat on it!) and the vent in the bathroom was full of dirt which must have taken months to accumulate. There were 10 of us in our party which meant we had booked 5 rooms for 4 nights each which we had booked and paid for 5 months in advance. At the time of booking we had also upgraded the rooms. I'm sure there are some nice rooms in the hotel - apparently the President stays at the Waldorf in the Presidential Suite when he goes to New York so I'm assuming that's quite a nice room! - but unfortunately it would seem that none of our party had a nice room as on our return and discussing the hotel it appeared that there were similar problems in all the rooms. My sister in law wouldn't even put her bare feet on the carpet in her room as it seemed so dirty and these were the upgraded rooms - what would we have got if we hadn't upgraded???

Just a tip, request your transfer driver/taxi driver, to drop you off at the \"check-in\" entrance, and not at the front of the hotel in Park Avenue, as you have to drag your bag up the stairs and through the foyer to get to the check-in counter. If you arrive at the hotel guest check-in entrance, the concierge marks your bag and stores it, and by the time you have checked-in and get to your room, your bags are already waiting for you. The doormen also went the extra mile, hailing cabs for guests, and even asked us where we were going and told the cab driver where to take us.

I complained by calling down from the room and was told by the reception manager that she was too busy to deal with me or my complaint. I went down to reception and threatened to make a fuss in the lobby if something wan't sorted and they found us a larger room, but still not the one I'd booked. We were there during labour day weekend for the US Open tennis and the hotel was packed. Clearly customer service had gone out the window. The new room was much larger but horribly old, tired and dirty. It even verged on the dangerous as the carpet was so threadbare that both my mother and I slipped over on it several times. Nothing has been updated or changed since our original stay in 2000. All the flower arrangements have been removed and even the carpets in the public spaces are dirty. Such a shame for a once fabulous grande dame. The only saving grace is that the beds are still comfortable. However, I doubt Hilton have any plans to change those either so presumably the only positive factor will be gone in a couple of years time. The service is laughable....after the mix up with the rooms, we were promised an additional foldaway bed which never arrived and then a complimentary bottle of cheap champagne was delivered to our room in apology....except that it wasn't for us.

Not every day can you say an award winning chef has prepared your lunch...well you can when staying at the Waldorf.

I got a really great deal on Expedia and was very excited upon check in to find out I had been upgraded to an Executive Suite on a Concierge level.

The concierge level offers a special room that serves a light breakfast including cereals, breads, fruit, and boiled eggs. There was coffee, juice, and water available.

I even told the clerk at check in \"there are 4 people in this room.\" I checked out, was told they were not able to print me a bill. 3 weeks later, I found out why. I saw an odd charge on my credit card for $122.77. I called the hotel to ask what this charge was for, we had not taken any items from the room, ordered room service or billed anything to the room. The billing department advised me that Travelocity told them to bill me this fee for extra person charges. I called Travelocity (Apparently the company Continental Airlines uses) and they said they knew nothing of it, had no records of ever telling the hotel this. I was eventually told by travelocity that the receipt says my room was a double room rate, not a quad rate, even though it says the room is for 4 on my receipt. I ended up giving the issue to my credit card company saying I did not authorize the charges and eventually, I was refunded the money. I am not sure if Travelocity, Capital One, or the Waldorf are responisble for the refund because none of them bothered to call or email me with a resolution.

We were on the Lexington side of the building (no view - but this was not my complaint). Here are the issues: stayed on 13th floor but visited other floors to confirm impression- once you've left the lobby and are on the Lexington tower you'll quickly notice some dramatic changes in quality and feel. Carpetting is very, very worn, does not look or smell clean or fresh. Gave me the same sense of cleanliness of the security checkpoint carpeting at the airport. Other than the ballroom floors, the hallways on the Lexington tower appeared to lack air conditioning and proper ventilation. I am 40 something guest....and never cared about ventilation before. Courtesy and personalized attention is non-existent (at least for patrons at this rate) - if you need anything more than to hand a tip or your credit card to anyone. The shower admittedly old, did not provide reasonable expectations of hot water or adequate pressure. The front desk attendees had a difficult time delivering a complete bill including mini bar charges. The mini bar had stale $6 potato chips. Room door is not well insulated. In the morning, we heard the whispers and non-whispers of a dutiful (and courteous) cleaning staff on the adjacent rooms. However, not a good sign if sleep is what you need. The TV appeared to be a $100 1990 Walmart purchase - my local Motel 6 has already updated to flat screens - not sure if too much to expect from the hotel touted as the only one where the President stays. Arrived very late at night with not another guest at the time. Nevetheless - it took over 35 minutes for the bags to make my room. It took me 3 minutes to get up to my room. We were pleased by the comfortable bedding. Not impressed by anything else. Hotel business center and computers are quite out of date. You share printers with others in a four computer small room. Difficult if you have sensitive business to work on. I thought this was unbelievable for a hotel of this magnitude. Person in charge of taking my bags for the afternoon after checkout would not stop asking what is my profession and whether business is good - not sure this is what I want to discuss with the hotel staff.

The Waldorf to us seemed very New York, very classic - it would fit so perect into our New York Destination Wedding. I was VERY disapointed in the hotel and service however not to be confused with my STAY in New York , that was amazing. You often read reviews and think \"Disgruntled traveller and blames everything \". I have taken the time to join up on Trip Advisor and write this review as I feel my stay needs to be shared. Check In - was quick and professional. however no \"extra\" service. Can conceirge help you with dinner reservations?, can I assit with any local information, is there anything I can do to assit with your stay ahead of time?. None of these were asked and it would have been a nice touch. It felt like you were at an airline counter, line up and be sent off in a hurry... Conceirge Rude , Rude , Rude and unhelpful. I was made to feel like an inconvenience at any time I had a request . Very disapointing. Extras It would have been nice to receive a welcome card or congratulations card or our wedding ; however their was no acknowledgement at all. Even though it was noted in our reservation and wearing a wedding dress is a clear indication. It wasnt a big deal however small touches do differ hotels from others. Room Service A bottle of champagne was delivered as a suprise to us from a friend ; we were then charged for this. Upon explaining this was a gift and it had clearly been pre paid ; we were given the third degree. After making us wait they found the records and then decided to remove it the bill. I was made to feel as if I was lying and trying to get a ree bottle ! We clearly made the mistake of putting our champagne in the minibar as then we were charged or $100.00 worth of items that were just moved to the side to make room. We were told that we were not allowed to make room for personal rereshments and that was considered taking the product. The drinks were just put on the side of the fridge as the minibar attendant would have clearly noted. Really.... a little pathetic. Afterall its still the champagne that was from their hotel. Valet Asking for my wedding dress to be pressed was such a challenge. I never thought a reequest of this nature would prove such a challenge and a 40 minute wait in the lobby. The bell captain was very unhelpful just telling me to call the Laundry on his desk phone and ask them my request ... very unprofessional ... can they not annouce calls and or handle requests themselves , making me wait? The service of the dress at the end was well done. All in all , I never mind paying top dollar for above adverage service to say the least this was just below par. The hotel would charge you to breathe! from $13.95 a minute local phone calls , excessive business centre charges, charged for extra glasses to be brought to your room, $5.00pp room service fee...

The hotel apparently does not have AC and heat...they only have one or the other. the temp was 80 degrees in NYC but the AC in the hotel had not been switched on. Our room was not uncomfortable but our friends did complain. they were told to open a window and they provided them with a small oscillating fan. It was funny to see this cheap little wal mart fan blowing around a room in the WA. Our room was small but it was well appointed. the bath towels were top notch and the bed was very nice. the 42 inch flat screen was cool too. check in service was polite and the concierge was very helpful. Bartenders were cool and recommended great restaurants. The WA is nice and everyone is as nice as they could be but honestly the place was a little disappointing. Overall, I think the problem that I, and all of our friends, had with WA is that the hotel itself does not live up to its big name. when you say WA you think of timeless elegance and oppulent accomodations. Not bashing the WA but we are just used to something a little nicer and i think most seasoned travelers would be on the same page.", "Date": "April 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "eandjbeck", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel, good service, challenged experience.\u201d", "Author": "eandjbeck", "ReviewID": "UR28497442", "Content": "The Waldorf is a beautiful Hotel with comfortable beds and a helpful staff. Its location is perfect, near the liveliest spots but far enough to allow for a good nights rest. Now for the not so great, our non-smoking room was a smoking room with an air-ionizer placed in it. The hotel double charged our account for our stay, only after placing a hold for 100 dollars a day over the initial quote for the possibility of \"incidentals\" (ie. minibar, internet use etc). This brought the on hold amount from our bank account to 240% of the initial quote. In the staffs defense, after being told by the desk attendant I was wrong and the charges were correct, the manager called and corrected their mistake, 24hrs later it was corrected, both on paper and in my bank account. The television remote never worked, but we were so tired from running at city speed we didn't have time to notice. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The staff, attentive and courteous, with the exception of the desk clerk,were always professional. I had high expectations for this hotel, but found myself disappointed when I had to correct another billing issue at check out, this time an incorrect charge for the minibar, of course in the hotels favor.

Breakfast included cereals, fresh fruit salad, yogurts, smoked salmon, bagels, a selection of breads, freshly brewed tea and coffees, all of which could be taken away and eaten in your room if you wanted.

Now, we would probably only stay in a hotel maybe two or three times a year, so are not experts or anything, but we know when we are enjoying something and we DEFINITELY enjoyed the Waldorf Astoria.

The restaurant promotes itself for its awarded beefsteaks, and we found our own to be true to the advertisement. The location of the hotel is magnificent, at the centre of action of New York City. Everything was near, and when we needed to do some shopping all we had to do was to walk a bit, simultaneously enjoying the atmosphere of the city.

If you go to the website you can also download an I-Pod walking tour of the hotel. Fabulous! We arrived early. Although our room was not yet ready, we were able to check in and have our luggage stored until we came back from a Times Square sight seeing walk and some lunch. After our return, we picked up our key and our luggage was taken to our room. We had a corner king (room 1113) on the eleventh floor. Note: After 6:00 pm you need to use your card in the elevator to go to your room. Our room was recently renovated. I had asked for a renovated room because the room we had last year, although very nice and large, was in need of sprucing up. This year, our room had tones of Gold with red, green and beige. The accents were dark wood and brass with beautiful fabric wall paper. There was plenty of closet space. The room included a long desk, comfy large upholstered chair, marble bath with tub/shower and plenty of towels, Lg. Phillips flat screen TV, I-Pod dock/radio/alarm clock with presets, 2 phones, and a comfy king bed with enough pillows for both of us ...I'm a pillow person. The bath had very nice amenities including cotton balls and tips, glycerine soap, lotion, shampoo, conditioner. There were heavy drapes at the window with both sheers and pull shades. The views from our two windows were fabulous. There was a great view through the far window of St. Bartholomews church and it's dome, as well as, down Park Avenue. The view from the front window was slightly obscured by the building but Park Avenue was still visible. The only thing I can say that isn't complementary is that our room had uneven floor boards under the carpet on one side of the bed. That's it. And truly, hardly worth mentioning. Nothing more than that. Everything else was great. In the morning, my daughter and I ordered up a small pot of coffee and small pot of hot chocolate. This is where you either like room service or not. I knew what the total cost would be before I ordered. But for those of you who may find this excessive I will explain. Each pot is $8.00...not too bad for a 3 cup pot in NYC. However, there is a $5.25 surcharge per person for your order. There were two of us, so, our coffee and chocolate came to $26.50 plus the $2 tip. If this is too much for you, there is a Starbucks downstairs at street level by the Park Avenue entrance (revolving doors) to your left, before you go up the stairs to the Terrace lobby. Or, you can take coffee downstairs in Peacock Alley or at the Terrace. Overall, everyone we interacted with at the Waldorf, from the doorman to the concierge to the reception desk to the waiter who brought up our beverages in the morning was very professional, courteous and helpful. They made my daughter feel as if she were a princess in a castle. The location can't be beat. This hotel is located on the East side of Midtown Manhattan. Close to Radio City, MOMA, Rockefeller Center, Top of the Rock, American Girl Place, Build a Bear and within a 10 minute walk of the Empire State Building and Times Square. A thirty minute walk will take you down to the Central Park Zoo. A little less time will take you to the park's playground, horse/carriage rides and FAO Schwartz (my daughter loved the floor piano -- think Tom Hanks in BIG). There are so many things to do at the park. On the East Side of the park, a little further down from the Zoo, is the petting zoo and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. On the West Side of the park (you will need to take a cab or walk for a bit) is the Museum of Natural History. Don't forget the Tavern on the Green, the castle and all the fabulous concerts and outdoor performances in the summer.

Although the Waldorf was fully booked, we never had to wait or ask for anything - check-in went very smoothly - we were escorted to our room and the luggage arrived immediately, as soon as we stepped outside we were asked if we needed a taxi and it was promptly hailed, as soon as we arrived to one of the hotel's restaurants we were immediately greeted and shown to our table, the server came to our table instantly and continued to provide excellent service, each call to guest services for a request had someone at our room within minutes - even getting our car at the end of our stay - Biden was arriving as we were leaving so the cars were being delayed but the staff was wonderful and very responsive to the guests - we relaxed in a lounge area of the hotel and when we returned to get our car, it was waiting with a couple people helping to load the luggage, open car doors, etc. - and, it was extremely busy at this time. Again, all the staff were genuinely warm, friendly and extremely efficient. Everything seemed to go perfectly, we did not have to \"think\" it was so seemless. The Waldorf is an older, historic property and there are some things about the Waldorf that probably would be helpful to know: - During all my stays, there has never been a coffee maker in the room, I have speculated on reasons - building construct and codes, etc., but have never found out for certain. However, we called room service and asked if they would deliver a hot pot and a variety of tea bags for our stay - we paid a very minimal charge and these items were delivered promptly. - Rooms appear to be continually renovated. Also, there is a great variety of room types and the floorplans on each floor vary. I always note that I would like a renovated room when making a reservation and repeat the request upon check-in. I have always received wonderful rooms. Each room appears uniquely decorated and this time we stayed in a beautiful one-bedroom suite that definitely had an elegant, warm, \"home\" feeling rather than a cookie-cutter hotel room feel. - As with any hotel, there may be maintenance issues, but the staff responds immediately and expertly if you mention it. We had one of the heaters in the living room giving off cold air, no heat.

This arrived in 5 mins - a brand new, quiet, tower style heater.

We made our reservation through American Express for a room listed as \u201c1 King Bed Concierge Level\u201d. The Waldorf had always been a hotel I wished to stay in so I was excited about the visit. The hotel is truly magnificent. Staying there really takes one back to a time when a visit to a hotel was an EVENT, not something we do simply as a necessity. I was taken thinking of how my parents or grandparents would have felt as a guest there, and how much the hotel has changed in the past century, but how little (overall) the Waldorf had managed to retain the grand charm of days long past. If for no other reason than connecting with history, staying in the Waldorf is an experience one must do at some point in their life. The room we were given was in the Waldorf Towers and we were very pleased with the room overall. The size was exceptionally large for a New York hotel room. In addition to the main bedroom, there was an entry foyer, a kitchenette area, a dressing area, and a very large bathroom. The fixtures were a nice blend of old and modern, from the trio of closets to the multi-jetted shower. The condition of the room was excellent and all the linens and amenities were of superior levels. The view was a decent view down Park Avenue but nothing postcard worthy. The Concierge Level lounge provided a very nice continental breakfast each morning in a private room. The quality of the food and the selection were excellent, even if you had only a moment to grab a coffee to go. The staff in this area did a nice job of helping with most all requests. The area is small though, so don\u2019t be shocked if you have to wait a few moments for a table. The main amenities of the hotel are all superior. The fitness facility is very modern and well thought out, even providing guests with fitness gear in case you have left yours at home. The concierge is most helpful, providing good information and reviews on local restaurants. The shops and business center are well done and very convenient. And the location of the hotel is hard to beat. My main complaint with the hotel is one of attitude towards guests who are younger than, say, 50 or 60 years. Although they were always polite, the staff seemed to be uncomfortable dealing with my wife and I (both in our 30\u2019s but looking much more like two people in their 20\u2019s). From the front desk to the bell attendants, there seemed to be this underlying sentiment of \u201care you sure you are old enough to be staying here?\u201d whenever we dealt with staff members. Given that we are polite, courteous and professional people, it caught us very off guard. Overall, this is a fine hotel and well worth a visit.

Frankly, this is an old, prestigious hotel, and I wanted to experience the art deco building and style. Check-In: More clerks than guests, so I walked right up at about 4pm. Pleasant clerk took my check-in, and said that I had been upgraded. Nice. Asked several times if there was anything he could do for me, anything I wanted to know. Nice attitude. Room: For NY, this was a LARGE room. Big King bed, huge desk, flat screen TV, mini-bar, two large windows (alas, overlooking a rooftop of another section of the hotel, but you can't have everything - if I looked sideways, I could see the street). Furniture was traditional style, and very fine. No wear and tear. Bathroom was good sized, black and white marble, exquisite fixtures in art deco style. Amenities: everything worked well, including the heat controls, and the maid did the room early each morning. Just fine. Newspaper every morning. General: Elevators are on key-card after 6pm for security, and they were FAST. Lobby is fantastic. The entire hotel is beautiful and kept up well. There were employees everywhere asking to help. The concierge was helpful, printed my boarding pass for the return flight without charge. Room service was expensive, so I left it out. No coffee maker, but I suppose that was an economy measure. Starbucks is in the hotel. Lower lobby. So, why bother? All-in-all, it was a very delightful stay. Room was great, checkout was swift. Internet in the lobby is free; in the room it is a charge. No problem sitting in the lobby accessing the net. Others did it too. Enjoyed seeing Cole Porter's piano in the Cocktail Lounge. And, I felt like a rich Master of the Universe, for only 120,000 points. The room is certainly worth the money - the location is great, the service is excellent, and the art deco furnishings and architecture are fabulous. A landmark it is.

The lobby is magnificant really opulant and I love that, we had no problems checking in, we all arrived separately and they accomodated an early check in as my brother was arriving first. The rooms where v small, which I was prepared for, however three of us where staying in a room with 2 double beds and there where 4 small drawers in total + a wardrobe for hanging, so we ended up just living out of our suitcases. Bathroom was tiny, but functional, we only used our rooms for sleeping and cleaning, so size wasn't getting us down. We had breakfast in the hotel in the morning (Peacock Alley - Oscars was shut during our stay) - cost was outrageous, I don't care how affluent you are, this was too much. Also having to pay to use the gym on top is bizarre I think. In summary, I found that other reviews lowered my expectations in terms of the rooms, however it was definately a dissapointment on my original impressions of how it would be. Lobby aside, the whole place is just a little too tired for my taste. Did I enjoy it - yes, as a one off with my parents and brothers, but would I go back again with my wife and kids - no.

Service was rubbish-we waited at the reception desk for about 45 minutes whilst people buzzed around EVERYWHERE. I was personally upset upon arrival to my room. It smelled of urine and smoke, the bathroom was appallingly tiny and the toilet failed to flush. It was a good summary of the Waldorf experience. Come dinner time on the first night, we were waiting for about an hour for some disappointing food which should have taken about half an hour maximum. The waiter had an attitude problem and felt the need to correct a jet-lagged and disorientated yours truly for pronouncing a dish wrong. Breakfast was fun, though (NOT). It was worse than waiting in a long queue at the supermarket. Whole groups of tourists gathered around our table to talk to friends sitting at other tables, taking photos and in general disturbing most people trying to eat their breakfast. Often, the queue for breakfast was so long that it extended up the stairs which lead to the room itself. To have an enjoyable breakfast you'd probably have to be down there by 6am. After two dreadful nights, we left the Waldorf Astoria and I honestly could not have been happier to find a haven in the form of \"Le Parker Meridien\". Not only was it less teeming with people, the staff were friendly, the rooms beautiful and modern and the service impeccable. This is a plea to anyone thinking of going to the Waldorf. Don't go!

Our one stay in the Towers is remembered mostly for the rude and unhelpful Towers staff. Our room expereinces in the main hotel have been hit-and-miss with both postives and negatives. In terms of the rooms alone, our best experience was being assigned a corner suite on a high floor. This suite was very spacious and the basic decor was classic. Yet, some of the furniture was broken and (in the bedroom) the backs were literally falling off both nightstands. The wall paper in the parlor was waterstained and bubbled around a window. I mention this case specifically because this is very typical of our 5 Waldorf expereinces--a mix of postiives and negatives that some will find acceptable (or at least tolerable) and others will judge totally unacceptable. This past year (2008) we had a Lexington Ave side king- suite--significantly smaller than the corner mentioned above but overall better appointed and in better condition. A few oddities with the bathroom plumbing and a large entertainment console that did not fit well in the parlor. Quite noisy at times due to Lex Ave emergency vehicles and garbage trucks. That mix again. The queen Astor suites in the Lexington Ave side of the hotel were redecorated a few years ago and overall I would expect these suites to be in better condition than others. Early on we had a mini-suite with an excellent bed but otherwise in need of furniture replacement--topped off by 2 bathrooms and a great view of the St. Barts dome across 50th street. Always a mixed experience. Over the years we have found the reception and housekeeping staffs to be polite and willing to help when asked. As I am a native New Yorker, we have never used the concierge staff. At present, it appears that occupancy is down (hotel was significantly less busy that in previous years)and staff reductions have already occurred. A problem in the making--not sure. So why then have we returned on numerous occassions? The main reason is that we have had mostly good times at the Waldorf, in large part because we have been able to enjoy the positives and put the negatives aside. In many ways this is a great classic hotel. In terms of cost, the suites have been nicely priced in late Dec. (relative to many other hotels). As others have frequently mentioned, the public spaces are magnificent. I started this review with a bit of a negative tone because I think that one should be aware of the Waldorf experience. Given that, I have rated the hotel above average overall as this is how we judge our collective experience with this hotel. As this forum indicates, many others have a different view. I have no reason to think that the general situation sketched out above will change for the bettter or for the worse. If you like modern and impeccably appointed hotels look elsewhere. If you are comfortable with history, classic decor, and flexible on many little details you may well enjoy a stay at the Waldorf. I believe that no two rooms/suites are the same, so you are in part dependent on the luck of the draw as far as accomodations are concerned. Will we return?--haven't decided yet.h", "Date": "January 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cunforgettable holiday\u201d", "Author": "mum08", "ReviewID": "UR23164544", "Content": "we stayed at the Waldorf for Christmas, what a great expierence.

I was spending a quick weekend for pre-xmas NY enjoyment and wanted to use some Hilton points. I saw I could book the fabled Waldorf Astoria - why not? I knew it was a bit of a gamble but figured the location was right, plus I didn't require much, and when else would I get to check it out? It went fine. It was what we needed. The location was indeed very good. The room was good enough. If I had paid $ I would have been very disappointed. It was like a best western I guess.. except I think those have had to keep up with the 1990s at a minimum. I can't think of much to compare it to. Old school vegas, maybe. Think freemont street. Frozen in time. Everything is a bit musty and dank. If they built it today and used that styling you might call it retro and give it a good laugh. When it is actual items from the 60s, however, they are a bit grimy and dirty. The rooms are full of carpet and oldness. There is a massive draft through the poorly sealed 1954 window. The temperature controls are pretty shoddy. Think motel 6. There are 600 uniformed employees to watch you as you walk around the hallways... there are large chandeliers... these things are all true - note them if they are what you are into. The mini bar doesn't autodetect what you take. If you are really lucky they will give you some COUPONS for free tiny bottles of water from the mini bar. They will instruct you to place these COUPONS in the minifridge in lieu of the water.. really... 1984-style. It is a riot. The showerhead literally has a font from a beatles album on it. Neat... but.. not very good for showering. The business center literally has FLOPPY DISKS for sale. I kid you not. I heard them tell someone they could lend him a charger for his laptop - $50/day. Funny stuff. Wifi? You gotta be kidding... nothing close. Lucky you have power. 2-prong power. No ground plug. I can't believe they had mag cards now that I think of it - I would have expected a bunch of skeleton keys handed out at the front desk. Kiosk checkin? HAHAHAHA. No way. Oh it gets better... We get a PERK.. free breakfast! After the checkin person mentioned 2 restaurants that would honor this, they backtracked in apparent embarrassment when the printed vouched stipulated the 'breakfast' was at.. STARBUCKS. Yup... one cookie and a coffee. Out of control with oldschool old-fashioned cheapness that seems ignorant of all the real hotels with customer service dotting the city. Oh yeah... went for a run. Wanted a hot tub. Called around and inquired about having one at the gym... no.. maybe the spa?... no... nowhere. No hot tub in the entire palace. Ok. In sum, this is without a doubt the worst hotel I've stayed at in years - and certainly in New York. It should definitely be demolished and replaced with something useful. It still exists for the same reasons as racism and The Varsity restaurant in Atlanta - sometimes people value 'tradition' over any actual quality/benefit.

This did not even cover the cost of a buffet breakfast for two. Our room was draughty, the sash windows were not clean and the whole room had an air of faded charm.

Great service from all, had a refrigerator delivered to the room FOC - great for keeping beers in ! - wonderful service from front of house, great bar - who could resist having a manhattan in manhattan !! - just a great place to spend a long weekend. i would recommend it. room was fine, a litlle dated, but what do you expect. everything clean and working order. had great alarm clock with ipod docking station. stole all of the toiletries and stationery, well, you have to don't you !! go there once, for the experience, you won't be disappointed - we weren't !", "Date": "October 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Finland", "Title": "\u201cTime Warp in a positive way\u201d", "Author": "JuhaniJyrkka", "ReviewID": "UR21124506", "Content": "After a couple of stays in this NYC classic I\u00b4m very pleased with service and also with rooms provided.

We found our way to the lobby with our cases and checked in within five minutes. The staff were friendly and asked if we needed help with our luggage but we declined, knowing that it might not arrive quickly. When we entered our room we were very impressed with the size and the decor was traditional and well maintained. We had e-mailed a few days previously to ask for the best room possible at our rate and also stated that it was our anniversary, so arrived to find a bottle of champagne and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries with a note wishing us a pleasant stay. The airconditioning was effective, the room was clean, and the maids provided a turndown service each night. We were on the 27th floor and had good views towards the East River and Park Avenue. We did not intend to eat at the hotel knowing that the prices were high, so have no complaints about the cost. We did drink in Harry's bar and ,although quite expensive, I am sure that we could have found other hotels nearby with the same prices. The hotel itself was beautiful, and if you take the time to walk around and explore, you can imagine what it must have been like in its heyday. The grand ballroom and silver corridor were especially magnificent. The location of the hotel is great as you are within easy walking distance of most of the main attractions but do not have to put up with the constant hustle and bustle of somewhere like Times Square We had no problems buying food nearby and ate in places varying from the cheap Viennese deli on Lexington towards the Chrysler building, to the Oyster bar in Grand Central Station, and the View restaurant 48 floor up in the Marriott Marquis hotel in Times Square. We also would recommend taking the Gray Line bus tours from the 49th street side of the hotel. We had 72 hour passes and these included all routes and tickets to the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty. There are street vendors everywhere but we bought ours at the hotel ticket desk. We experienced prompt attention and good service with no queues. We went to the Statue of Liberty via the bus and although it took some time to get there, the tour was very interesting. The queue to the boat was long but moved very quickly and we only waited half an hour. We did not get off the boat but you can disembark at Liberty Island and Ellis Island if you wish. We went to the Empire State building when it opened at 0830hrs as recommended by the hotel staff, and walked straight through with no waiting and no crowding on the viewing platform. Later in the day queues form outside and around the building. Returning to the hotel after a busy day was always a pleasure and the sheer opulence of walking through the lobby and not being in a brand new 'chain' hotel with no history was lovely. Staying at the Waldorf Astoria does not have to be that expensive and to be in such beautiful surroundings only enhanced our stay in New York.

The bathroom and the bedroom were spacious. The bathroom had been renovated, but it seemed more like a 'face-lift'. The sheets on the bed were ok and the towels in the bathroom were good as well. Getting a cab from the Park Street entrance was a nightmare. The front door men seemed really lazy and there was always a line of people waiting for a cab. Not to mention the bike riders constantly asking if you want a ride. It's NY, so it's ok. The staff would try and move them to the side, but they always seemed to be in the way of cabs and cars. It was easier to walk a block down and flag a cab myself. The restaurant took a very long time to get seated for breakfast, which was odd considering there were only 4 people eating at the time.

When they turned it back on at about 7:30 a.m., it came out of the facets in the sink, the shower and in the toilet, black. We could not shower, wash or even brush out teeth. When I got down to the desk to complain, I had to wait in line to speak with someone. I heard other people compaining about the water as well. I was compensated with a free night. That was the only prositive part of my stay. They also sent our bill up to our room on the day of checkout, riddled with mistakes. There were charges for mini bar purchases we did not make and charges to the fitness centre when my husband is a gold priority club member and fitness centre visits are free.

Our room seems to have been updated based on other review. The bath room and room are a bit on the small side but this is NYC. They are big for NYC. I have stayed at other hotels in the city with smaller rooms. The room was cleaned every day and even had a turn down service. My issue with the Waldorf was that nothing seemed to run smoothly. Maybe my expectations were too high. We checked in at 11 am and were told our room was not available. This was no big deal and expected. We were asked to give them a cell phone number and they would call. We were also told not to stand in line when we returned since all we needed to do is big up keys. I should also mention that we were using Hilton Points to stay at the hotel and were in the city for a wedding. We left the hotel and went to entertain ourselves in the city. At 4:30, we decided we should head back since we had to be at the wedding rehearsal at 7pm. It was over 100 degrees in the city that weekend and needed to shower before the event. When we arrived at the hotel we went were we told to go at 11 am. A woman working for the hotel came over and said we needed to stand in the check in line. After explaining our situation she said we still need to stand in the line; which had over 10 people in it. Oh, I have forgotten to mention I am Hilton Gold. After a 20 minute wait, we got to someone to help us. We were told that we had been upgraded to a nicer room but it still wasn\u2019t available at 5:30pm. At which point, I told her I had to be somewhere at 7pm and needed to shower ASAP. She left to go speak to a peer. 15 minutes later we were given a room key. We were told it was just a normal room and to make it up to us they would give us drinks at one of the hotel bars. At this point, I was more worried about making the rehearsal. We were told our bags would be sent up. After 30 more minutes our bags finally arrived. The room was extremely hot. The bell boy told us they don\u2019t keep the AC on in the rooms. He showed us how to work it and left. We were in the room for only 45 minutes before we left as well. The room was as hot as when we got into it. When we got home at 2am the room had not cooled down at all. However, since it was so late and we were exhausted we decided not to worry about it. The next day we went to the front desk and they said they didn\u2019t have any other rooms at that time but could move us later in the day around 6pm. The wedding was at 5pm and that was not going to work. They said they would send maintenance up to the room and see what was wrong. That night it didn\u2019t feel any cooler. The next day we noticed the entire hotel was warm. In the long run I do not think there was anything wrong with the AC. I believe the Waldorf is an old hotel with an old AC system that can not handle a 100 degree heat wave. On our last day we checked out and stored our bags at the hotel. When we came back to get them at 4pm, it took over 45 minutes to get them. The bell boy even expected us to tip him. FOR WHAT! Thankfully, our car service understood and we still made our flight with plenty of time. Some other issues were that neither our tub nor sink drained properly. Additionally, the mini bar smelled like something had died in it. The smell was terrible. Thankfully, we only opened it once to get our Hilton Gold Gift-bottle water. I did mention this to the maid in the halls. She said she would clean it. I do not know if it was done since I didn\u2019t want to risk opening it again. PEWWW!!! We also had a few drinks with friends at Sir Harry\u2019s in the Waldorf. The service was terrible. We hit it at a lull so I would expect some slowness but we both had to ask for our bill and then also walk it up to someone to get it run after waiting 20 minutes for her to pick it back up. Unfortunately, my experience didn\u2019t get any better once I got home. My bill was $0 since I was using Hilton points for my stay. The Hilton website confirms. However, once I got my credit card statement I had 3 charges on my statement from the Waldorf. One for $16.10; one for $8.70 and one for $1578.00. I have been on the phone with the Waldorf and they plan to credit my card back for all the charges. It is just a hassle to deal with in the first place. I am glad that I got to experience the Waldorf. If I was paying for the hotel, I would go somewhere else. There are plenty of hotels in NYC that do a better job and have better service. The name isn\u2019t worth what they are charging and for what you get. Once you get out of the lobby the rooms are the same as any other Hilton, DoubleTree, or Marriott.

Rooms were big - our room had two double beds, walk in wardrobe (great for the shopping bags) although it did have a small bathroom. We experienced problems with the shower.. you have to run it for over 15 mins before any hot water. My sister complained once and was given breakfast vouchers (which we didnt use) but the water was never fixed properly.

The best part of our stay were the beds, because they were some of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept on.

One was the constant static electricity we built up due to the plush carpets throughout the hotel. We kept getting shocked every time we touched metal. The second was the maids who were quite insistent upon coming in to turn down the sheets around 6pm, even when we asked them not to. They seemed to be blatently pressing for tips.

For the last few years I've stayed at the Hilton on Avenue of the Stars and it was fine, but I thought I'd try Hilton's \"premier\" NYC property the famed Waldorf Astoria.

I had a 6th floor room with a view of anything other than a rooftop. Fine, not a big deal but the floor was also being used to host a conference of some kind and there were tables set up in the hall all the time of my stay and a constant procession of wait staff setting up things for the conference. When I got to the room neither the TV nor the Air Conditioner worked. I called about both. They fixed the TV but didn't do anything about the A/C. (The TV here is a old tube not like the sexy flat screen a the \"lesser\" Hilton a few blocks away). I called again about the A/C the next morning and they said they'd fix it .. but nothing again. The morning of my last night there, I called again. When I got in from my meetings at the end of the day, they had installed a crappy window unit air conditioner in the room. It was extremely loud and was letting in heat in the side spaces where it didn't quite fit in the window. I called and complained and told them I wanted my rate reduced. They agreed to give me my last night free. Of course, when the bill came under the door it included my last night so I had to go wait in line and manually check out in order to get that night removed (And explain the whole experience again). I've actually never answered the question \"how was your stay?\" with the answer \"not good\" before until now .... at worst, I would say \"fine\" to the person checking me out but I just couldn't hold my tongue.

My parents stayed their about 25 years agoand I had always wanted to stay their. We're from Las Vegas and we've stayed in many luxury hotels all over the country. This Hotel was exceptional, especially when you consider the history of the building. We need to get one thing straight. The Waldorf=Astoria is OLD. If you're expecting everything to look shiny and new, you'll be disappointed. If, however, you are willing to accept the fact that you're in a well kept piece of American history, and not the Disney/Vegas-based hotel/resort, you'll be in good shape. The hotels does have its pros and cons. To be honest, I probably wouldn't stay at the Waldorf again on my own dime. The place is full of history and really lets you peek into what the \"old guard\" must have marveled at in it's day. The entire hotel drips with history and old world charm that makes it very obvious as to why its considered the \"Gand-dame\" of hotels. But for a regular guy like me who wants to squeeze as much luxury as i can get for my dollar, it may seem like a waste of money. Though my wife and I agree that the service and staff were all phenominal. We just couldn't bring ourselves to spend $8.50 for a glass of Sprite and $14 for an Amstel light at the bar. The $95 per person Sunday Brunch buffet had us very puzzled, as we've both been to some of the greatest buffets in the country and never paid more than $30 per. If you're a business traveler and have a decent expense account, the Waldorf may be for you as the hotel seems to be really concentrating on large meeting and conferences, which with corperate sponsorship, would make more sense for some of the prices. The area itself is just about perfect if you want to be close to the action, but not RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of it. A ten minute walk will get you to Times Square, which in my opinion is just an unkempt Disney-type property. Every piece of wall is covered with some sort of advertisement designed to catch your eye, and there are thousands of ads trying to out-do eachother to get you attention, so all together you look at everything and focus on nothing. Though it is quite the spectacle, Times Square epitomizes that universal image of NYC; almost overwhelming. Before you get to Times Square from the hotel you'll run in to Rockefeller Center. Top of the Rock is a must do. Beware of the creepy security guard at the top who REALLY seems to like to take pictures of couples kissing with the view of the city in the background. My wife and I couldn't stop laughing because he kept moaning \"yeah, yeah, kiss her again\". Friendly guy though! Walk over a few blocks to the east of the hotel and there are several privately owned restaurants that won't hurt your wallet. We really liked Ristoranta Lazagna. Great specials and amazing Lazagna, especially for the price. We also enjoyed the Grayline Hop-on/off bus tours.If you walk into this the the mind set that you're going to get to see the city from a bit better view than what you would in a cab, you'll appreciate it a bit more. Don't expect much more aside from that. What more advice can I give you? Don't be afraid to eat off the street carts. Try the gyro guy a block west of Rockefeller Center. Try Ray's Pizza on 7th Ave btwn 53rd and 54th st. and have a slice. Try the original Grimaldi's Pizza in Brooklyn. Friendly staff and great pizza. Don't be afraid of the subway, It's very easy to learn the system, and most people will gladly help you find your way around. Try everything!!! It's New York City!! Last last bit of advice is to take comfortable shoes. In NYC you never realize how much you've walked until the end of the day.

Couple of small issues- the furniture was dirty and could stand to be cleaned and even on the 13th floor the room was noisy. The concierges were useless, usually concierges in a NYC hotel are helpful and knowledgeable. And I expected the same from a large hotel like the Waldorf. I called about a week or so ahead of time to see if they had any pull at a particular restaurant and the concierge could not have been less helpful. To quote, \"Its not like they are holding any tables for us\" well no [--]. During our stay I asked one of the concierges about the address for Brooks Brothers and what the cross street was- no clue what Brooks Brothers was!! She aked me to spell it for her and then she had to google it-I eventually just walked away. Overall the staff at the hotel was great the exception being the dopey concierge staff. Also Bull and Bear drinks are outrageously expensive. I've been to NY many times but even I was a little surprised at 18.00 for a gin and tonic and 20.00 for a maritni. But the atmosphere is very NY and the bartender was excellent.

The paint was peeling and the bathroom had make up all over the door and basin. I used the toilet and it got blocked, very blocked, so we called reception who said they would get a plumber. By this time, we were beside ourselves with tiredness. We asked if we could have another room to go to sleep and were told no as it should not be long. The room was like a sauna all night and we slept in by 30 minutes(having slept about 2 hours in all) so we missed the buffet breakfast that we had paid for months before. They said all they could offer us was coffee and sweet pastries. It was such a waste of money, hard earned money. I have stayed in better hotels here for 1/4 of the price.

The entire place had that \"old money\" feel. Our checkin was quick, but we didn't have our confirmation page with us. We were told to provide it before we left or we would be charged $910 a day. We were not required to have bell service with our bags. We were given 4 free passes for a drink/Bull and Bear or for a breakfast/Oscar's. We took the drink tickets and headed down to the Bull and Bear. Our wine was $14 a glass. The three of us had dinner for a grand total of $333. Two of us had the filet for $50 each. It was terrific, but it could have been a smaller cut for less money. The lobster soup was first a dollop of lobster served in a bowl with garnish. The server then came back and poured the bisque into the bowl. Fabulous! We tried the waldorf salad, but it was basically a partial red and green apple slivered for $17? My friend had just had a birthday, so she picked up the tab as her celebration. One of us is a smoker so we were going down the elevator a lot at night to smoke at the ground level parking entrance. We wound up making friends with the valet staff. There is also a private entrance down there for upscale clientele. One night we saw Donatella Versace and her daughter, Allegra. Room Service: We didn't want to pay $8 for a small pot of coffee (3 cups) delivered to the room...plus a 15% gratuity and a $5.25 service charge. Instead we headed across the street/outside on 50th Street to Starbucks. $2.11 for a Grande/including tax. Later on we found out there was a Starbucks in WA, but their prices were higher. Suite: There were beautiful tapestry pillows and bed runners on the beds. The first time we returned to our room after being out all day, we found our beds turned down with the music playing at the IPOD station. We enjoyed the scented body lotion left for our use in the bathroom. The bathroom lacked a fan for ventilation.

One evening in the bar the barman looked a bit sniffy at our 15% tip on 2 drinks. And my parents had a problem with their room. Good bits - Fabulous lobby - very grand and beautiful. Every member of staff we had contact with was extremely friendly, polite and professional. We got some great advice on where to eat, and excellent help with everything we asked - cancelling a restaurant booking we had made elsewhere, directions, booking return flight seats - nothing was too much trouble! Our room was spacious, and we had a corner room, so 1 window that overlooked other room windows, and the other with a view down Park Avenue. Big TV, great radio / clock, and a really comfortable bed. There was a room service note to say they would change the sheets every 3 days unless we asked them to change more often, but they changed the linens every day anyway. Our bathroom was small, but looked like an original bathroom, which we thought was nice - it was small, but fine for 2 people. Good turndown service - bedside lights are turned on, and the radio is left on low so its almost like youre returning home. Maybe if I were to be picky I could say that the decor was a bit faded, but if we wanted sparkle and modern we would have stayed at the W or the Hyatt. MY parents twin room was large with a gorgeous bathroom, but they did have a problem, and when they spoke to reception they were immediately moved to a suite which was beautiful. Their problem was handled swiftly and professionally - perfect! We didnt find the hotel, the other guests,or the staff stuffy or snobby in the least. There were functions going on every day, and we just marvelled at the management that this took. It was lovely to see people all dressed up in their finery, and yet we didnt feel out of place at all. Some of the reviews had said you would be out of place if you werent dressed up in designer clothes at all times, but I dont see that - I saw people in jeans and trainers, flip flops, and shorts and t shirts just back from running, and no-one batted an eye. Some of the retaurants have a dress code, but thats to be expected, isn't it?! There is a starbucks just to the left of the main doors that opens at 6.30.

Don't ever book a room that is near the elevator because all you will hear all night is the sound of a 747 taking off down the runway. The website doesn't tell you that there is a Starbucks down stairs. And it does not tell you that it costs 50.00 a day to park your car and an additional 10.00 if you have an SUV. I paid 120.00 bucks for two days OUCH! The lobby is very \"grand\" and dark, again like an old ship. I will say that when I checked in I found the staff to be very friendly, including the bellmen, the doorman and any man or woman that worked there. Here's a cool fact that the man who checked me in told me when I had advised him that my father stayed there in 1950 for his honeymoon, he asked if he still had that bill? Then went on to tell me if he still had the bill and wanted to stay there, that the Waldorf would honor that price he paid in 1950. If you are going to have to stay in a hotel, don't you want to have the same amenities or even better amenties that you do at home? I suppose if you are a history buff, you might love it", "Date": "April 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "N.J.", "Title": "\u201cElegance and Service with a great location!\u201d", "Author": "FamilyofFiveNJ", "ReviewID": "UR14813136", "Content": "My husband took me to New York City to celebrate my 40th birthday. We spent two nights in the Waldorf-Astoria. This hotel embodies old word elegance and charm. I felt like I was in the middle of an old Hollywood movie from the moment I walked into the impressive lobby. This sprawling hotel is also quite luxurious with plush carpets and swag draperies. A bellman greeted our cab as we pulled up to the hotel and our luggage was whisked away by very efficient porters. At check in, we learned that our room probably wouldn't be ready until about 3:00 p.m. The front desk clerk took my husband's cell phone number and said that he would give us a personal call when our room was ready. After receiving the call that our room was ready, we took a ride in the elevator to the 15th floor where our room was located. I must admit, after reading some of the trip reviews posted here, I was a little nervous and scared that I would find mold in the bathroom, peeling wallpaper, or dirty furniture. Thank goodness I did not find any of these things. Instead, we walked down a private corridor to our room and were greeted with a very elegant and clean bedroom. The main room had a King sized bed, a plush chair, a desk and chair, nightstands and an armoire with a large flat screen T.V. on top. Off of the bedroom was a dressing room with another plush chair, a small table, two mirrored his and her wardrobe closets, and a vanity area with stool. The bathroom had French doors and was done in black and tan. There were lots of nice details such as silver waste baskets, a silver tissue holder, complimentary magazines relevant to the NYC area, and plush robes. The molding and light fixtures were very pretty and added character to the room. Shortly after settling into our room there was knock on the door. Because it was my birthday, the hotel sent up a birthday card and a silver tray complete with fresh fruit, a small loaf cake, and a large bottle of Spring water. It was services like this that made our stay so unforgettable. We ate in Peacock Alley and Oscar's while we were there. I ordered a steak in the Peacock Alley and was disappointed to find that it was full of fat and quite tough. The service in the restaurant was top notch and the waiter quickly noticed my distress. The manager came over and said that we would not be charged for my entree and would I like the chef to grill me another steak? They also provided my husband and I with complimentary flutes of champagne in honor of my birthday. My husband was very pleased with his meal and gave it a thumb's up. Since the service was so wonderful, the unfortunate steak incident was quickly forgotten. We had breakfast both mornings in Oscars. They offer a decent breakfast buffet which was complimentary to us since my husband in a Hilton Diamond member. The location of this hotel is very nice. Walk two blocks and you are right at Saks Fifth Avenue and across the street from Rockefeller Center. You are within walking distance of Central Park, great shopping on and off Fifth Avenue (including Bloomingdales), and Times Square. Cab service was very easy to catch from the front of the hotel. The hotel assists guests with finding a cab. The bellman always opened the door when the cab pulled back up to the hotel which gives you a nice \"welcome home\" feeling. One thing I did find strange was that the conditioner, soaps, and moisturizer were all from the same English brand but the shampoo was Neutrogena. They did not refill the soaps or shampoo between cleanings of the room. We did enjoy the turn down service each night because they also pulled down all the window shades and closed the curtains. We did not find the room to be too noisy considering that we were staying in such a central section of the city.", "Date": "April 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, UK", "Title": "\u201cFamous hotel, but a little dated\u201d", "Author": "trumptonfireman", "ReviewID": "UR14803315", "Content": "The Waldorf does live up to its reputation, although in parts, it is becoming rather dated.

We paid a bit extra for a superior room but got a good discount. The room was very large with 2 king size beds and a walk in wardrobe and beautiful marble bathroom. You will be bowled over by the architecture and stunning flower displays. The rooms do not have tea and coffe making facilites but there is a Starbucks in the main entrance that we used. A good tip if you havent been to NYC before is to take advice from the concierge with regard to restaurants as some look decidely ropey from the outside but fantastic when you get in. We had great meals in Little Italy and China Town. We also booked Empire State building on the internet and got a far better deal than if we paid on the day (plus you can jump the queue) We went to BB Kings for brunch on Sunday with the Harlem Gospel singers and had a great time. This was also booked online as all the shows at BB Kings were sold out for the 4 days we were there. The pace in New York is frantic and all the people we met were friendly and helpful without exception. The key is to plan what you want to do but be flexible according to the weather.

Unfortunately after the front desk, service pretty much went down hill. I remember Lauren checked us in and she was quite nice giving us the option of two rooms to choose from and even supplied us with a map of NYC, complimentary water and a verbal overview of the hotels restaurants. The room (1727) was nice enough, pretty clean and I could find almost no fault with the room, loads of hot water, working quiet heater, no inside or outside noise. The lotion that the staff leaves from FRESH is top-notch. Unfortunately at the Waldorf apparently the doormen are too busy doing other things (standing around looking Waldorf=Astoriaish) to hold open doors. At the Waldorf bell hops are too busy (talking about other guests broken luggage) to take your bags and just leave you standing around feeling foolish in front of the hellhop desk. At the Waldorf cleaning staff never fully make your bed, but instead leave the bedspread and shams folded in the room on the luggage rack for your entire two night stay. At the Waldorf's Bull and Bear Restaurant where one soda, one drink and dessert run $50 the staff is far too busy to provide your table with a table cloth or service of any kind. At the Waldorf you will be left to fight off black town cars sent over by the staff to take you to the airport. The WA even has a sign inside suggesting you only take yellow checker cabs, so why an employee would send a black town car over to it's guests is beyond me. If you want to stay here, you are going to do it no matter what you read.

Check in was fast and courteous. The Receptionist wasn't overly friendly or interested in us but that suited us quite well as we just wanted to get to our room. We'd had a long and bumpy flight and been terrorised by the rudest little man I've ever met at immigration in JFK. Anyway. The room was a good size, very clean and comfortable. I had been worried by previous reviews mentioning the shabby decor but although it did look a little tired and dated in places the wonderful comfortable beds, walk in closet and fluffy towels made up for that. The bathroom was also slightly dated but the shower was great and the toiletries were replenished daily. There was a good hairdryer in the room and an iron with ironing board. The only things missing were tea and coffee making facilities. I know Americans don't drink much tea but this was an international hotel and I go a bit mad without my tea. The staff were helpful and polite and I did feel a little bit special despite it being such a large hotel. This was very welcome because outside of the hotel almost all the New Yorkers I met were very rude - something I found gobsmacking in a city where the world and his wife wants a tip for their \"good\" service. I only had two real problems with the hotel. Firstly, the lighting in the bathroom was somehow rigged to make you look like you'd been dead 4 weeks - or feel like you wish you'd been dead 4 weeks. I've never felt so ugly! Secondly, the entire hotel gives out electric shocks constantly and is filled with the sight of people leaping back from light switches and elevator doors. It did make us laugh at first but when you've had your 9th shock of the day and start debating with your friends who is going to draw the short straw and have to touch a door nob then it gets a little bit irritating. However, these are minor points and if you can get a good price via the internet then I recommend the Waldorf because of it's location, cleanliness and peace (the lobby is often very busy but once upstairs in our room we never heard a sound from another room or from outside). I wouldn't pay the full prices asked for if you book directly. We didn't eat in any of the restaurants as we'd heard they were expensive but did enjoy some ultra strong but wonderful cocktails in the lobby one afternoon.

The bathroom was large, with fabulously opulent oversized taps and shower fittings. The bath was DEEP, so you could really soak away a day' worth of walking in it. The toiletries were quality and smelled wonderful - and were replenished when even a little bit had been used. The sink area was between the bathroom and the main suite, and had a large, well lit mirror over it.

This is the legendary Waldorf=Astoria, after all, so before the trip, I checked the negative reviews here for things to be wary of. I need not have bothered, for I had that rarest of hotel experiences - feeling sorry to leave at the end. What about some of the most common previous criticisms? 1. Rooms too small: My room was fine, 20 sq. meters. 2. Musty, old smells: The room and corridors were not scented, but smelled fresh and crisply clean. 3. Decrepit heaters. My room heater was indeed an old design, but quiet and extremely efficient. The electronic temperature control worked perfectly (It was -4C outside).. 4. Not \"value for money\": Maybe not, if you consider only the high cost of a bed here. But I was aware of enjoying every moment in the hotel, not because of the room, but for the elegant hallways, the beautiful lobby, the historic ambiance, photographs, and mementos (including Cole Porter's piano in the Park Lane lobby), plus the bustle of people coming and going and meeting by the old clock in the main lobby. You do also pay for the Waldorf=Astoria New York experience - and it's worth it. 5. Offhand staff: Unobtrusive, maybe, but I liked that - and friendly, without the \"have a nice day\" American fakery. I got to test the reception staff when I found my check-out date was incorrect, a day too early. (Not the hotel's fault, my office screwed the booking). I expected reception to find me another hotel, or at best another room, but not at the lower conference rate I had checked in on - since the place was clearly booked solid. It may have taken 20 minutes juggling bookings on his computer, but the receptionist managed to keep me in my room for another day. It was at a higher price (which was OK), but then his supervisor stepped in from behind him and told him to keep me on the cheaper rate and she would actually enter on the computer that the hotel had misbooked my dates. I have never experienced individual service like that in any major hotel. My conclusion - this is a hotel to fall in love with. It was beautiful, elegant, friendly, a pleasure to walk around. My room was as comfortable and friendly as home, the superb breakfast and cheery staff at Oscar's restaurant made waking up early every morning a real pleasure. Complaints? 1. The room Internet rate of $15 a day is a ripoff. But the wi-fi in the lobby is free, and my room was covered by a couple of independent wi-fi transmissions of intermittent quality. 2. The usual mini-bar scam. Ignore it. I found several small shops nearby and loaded up with snacks and a bottle of Scotch for around the price of one mini from the bar. 3. Amazing, this - no coffee maker, water heater in the room.", "Date": "March 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNot bad at all\u201d", "Author": "Matt-7", "ReviewID": "UR14007142", "Content": "I stayed here for 4 nights with my girlfriend mainly for a shopping trip and enjoyed the stay.

On the plus side, the lobby is great looking and the rooms are very comfortable compared to most 4* hotels in new york. They are also a decent size. On the negative, the hotel is a business hotel and is very very large so there are lots of suited people all day long. (I was on holiday so wanted to stay away from work). There are 10 people serving at check-in who are busy all day. Lots of conferences are held at the hotel and you get the feeling that you are not one of their important guests and therefore deserve less attention - in room movies didn't work so we called down and were put on hold for 10mins before we gave up. Only a minor hiccup but noticeable because it is the Waldorf Astoria and I'm sure if we were a guest at the conference where the Duke of Westminster was speaking they would have treated us differently. All in all though a good hotel to stay in as it's only a short walk to most places like Bloomingdales etc. I would recommend it for the experience but in all honesty would not stay again as there are better hotels in New York which have better service and I personally prefer staying a bit closer to time square so that everything is on the doorstep.", "Date": "March 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cOldie but a goodie\u201d", "Author": "yaltachick", "ReviewID": "UR13939830", "Content": "Fabulous stay at the Waldorf.

Have been reading all the reviews in the past months leading up to our trip and was a little worried about our stay here. It turned out to be perfect! We loved the hotel, its location, the service, the breakfast (only meals we ate here). The only problem we encountered was at the check-in (unfortunately). We had a gentleman who insisted on putting us in a small room w/2 double beds w/no extra sitting area, couch, etc. My husband is a Hilton Gold Card Member and whenever we travel to Hilton hotels they are very accommodating. We were w/our 15 yr. old who has allergies and this was documented at the time we made our reservation. I believe it was because we were using our Hilton points to reserve the room. I had called numerous times and was told that in the middle of February it is their slow season and there shouldn't be any problem w/an upgrade. He began to chastise me about the allergy problem, saying I should have made note of this prior to check in, which I had, more than once. Since my husband is 6'3\" and a very early riser I asked for a cot for my daughter if we couldn't have a bigger room. Even being a Hilton Honors Member he wanted to charge us $35/ a night. I finally agreed to the regular room w/no cot and when we were brought up to the room it was very small compared to other Hiltons we have stayed in. The problem was that the beds were pushed up against the wall with a desk in between them so there was no logical way to get out the bed. If I had been travelling w/just my daughter or one other person we would have been able to make do but because there were 3 of us in this room for 3 days I knew it would be a problem. My husband ended up asking to speak to one the managers and she corrected the problem immmediately. They put us on a lower floor but in a 2 room suite - 1 queen bed and bath and a living room area w/ a fold out couch. This was perfect for us and not sure why the person at check-in would not have given this to us as it was requested on all our check-in information The manager who moved us also sent up a box of chocolates which was a very nice gesture. The rest of our stay was wonderful and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to NYC because of its location and such a beautiful hotel. Our room (both rooms) were extremely clean, maid service was 2x a day. The hallways always smelled vey clean with a nice fragrance (not sure what they used but would love to find out). We had great service at breakfast and enjoyed the buffet. Not sure what the other reviews are talking about in the cleanliness or condition of property because that was not our experience.

Why in the days of double or even triple glazing such noise should disturb ones sleep, is beyond me! Particularly when you provide such comfortable mattresses.

When the maid raises the roller blinds, the cords are too short to be regained without standing on the desk! The general state of the decor is tired, the handbasin cracked, the bathroom door seen better days, the cornice around the room poorly patched! And yet, the room has no disposable slippers, no safe, no sewing kit, no tea or coffee making equipment. The decor around the elevators on floor 10 is badly held together with duct-tape! When we left the room one day at 08.30 and toured the city, upon returning at 16.30 the room had not been serviced, and we were obliged to go out again while it was serviced! The toiletries which exist on entry to room, mouthwash, cotton buds etc are not replenished once used! So had to go out and buy our own! On Saturday evening when I called down to order a Sunday paper, I was told \"we don't do papers at weekends!\" when I said it was part of the room service breakfast menu, the guy checked and then came back to the phone and said \"what paper you want!\".

Like the other reviews say, the lobby is beautiful and the staff was very helpful. I am a diamond member at hilton at they have a separate diamond reception desk to check you in which is very nice, I wish other Hilton hotels had this. The diamond desk rep was very nice and gave me a large room overlooking park ave with a bathroom that was actually bigger then the bedroom.

The room came with two robes and slippers which was nice and if you are an HH member you get free water from the mini-bar. Unfortunately that is where the amazement ends. The bedroom, while not bad, was not what I would expect from a flagship hotel. The TV was about as old as the hotel was and the furnature and fixtures are showing their age. The architecture in the room is very impressive with vaulted ceilings, arched walkways and a huge arch above the tub. The ceiling fixtures are classic, but the old wallpaper and peeling paint really take away from it. The carpet is quite old and faded and the bed is actually not as nice as most hilton bed I stay in. I realize that this is a classic hotel and very old but really, does it take that much effort to keep it up, they manage it at the plaza just fine, and its a shame because honestly, even though its a classic hotel and the service was wonderful I would most likely not return. Another detractor from the hotel is the price gouging that continually gets you. Room service for a burger, coke and desert was $70, parking was $55, internet was $23 a day, you will not eat in the hotel for under $70 a person no matter what restaurant you choose.

The paint was peeling from the walls in areas, there were evident damp patches, peeling wall paper etc. Fortunately, at first glance this isn't too obvious, but is really disappointing for such a high-priced establishment. Our suite on the 20th floor had a large terrace/balcony which was great for viewing the skyline from (and as a location for our wedding photos) - unfortunately it's not decorated/kept in any way and is therefore rather ugly and littered with hundreds of cigarette and cigar butts. Quite foul. It can't take much effort to pop a couple of plant pots up there and sweep up the litter! We didn't have any problems entering the hotel, as previous reviewers did. In fact the door staff were very friendly and really helpful with directions/taxis. On the whole, we really enjoyed our stay (we had a fantastic wedding!) but would agree that the WA is trading off it's reputation a little too recklessly. Considering the room rates and other charges in the hotel, they should really give some attention to the upkeep of the rooms... Plenty of NYC hotels offer a lot more for a lot less, but none can match the grandiose old-fashioned sophistication of the WA.", "Date": "January 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peebles", "Title": "\u201cNice but dated and expensive\u201d", "Author": "G M", "ReviewID": "UR12556148", "Content": "The hotel is impressive from the outside, has laods of history and character attached to it and well worth a stay but...it's decor is dated, it's a little impersonal and food and drinks really over priced.

Staying in a King mini-suite, our room felt fresh and clean, with all the charm that you would expect from the Waldorf. The view wasn't amazing, which was a shame, but we spent more time out exploring than gazing out of the window anyway!! There were negative aspects - it took us 20 minutes to check in for no apparent reason and I would advise most to stay away from Oscar's (restaurant/bar near Eastern entrance). Although the food was good, we waited almost 90 minutes for our main course and the waiters seemed, well, incompetent. Everyone seemed to be complaining and sending food back to the kitchen for various reasons - apparently they were short of kitchen staff. However, I have heard better reviews from others, so maybe it was a one off. Regarding other staff - most were friendly and helpful but there were the occasional employees who didn't really seem to care what impression they were giving (again, mainly in Oscars).

Even then the disappointment was starting to set in. With only 24 hours in New York (with my wife and daughter) I decided to book us on a couple of short tours to make the most of our visit to the city. The tour desk in the lobby were extremely helpful and within minutes had us booked on a harbour tour with Circle Line that evening and an open-top bus tour of Manhattan the following morning. Already my wallet was nearly $200 lighter \u2013 the fees for the tours plus the Waldorf Astoria tour desk's commission on top. As I turned from the desk, my wife said, \u2018I think he was expecting a tip. He put his hand out as you turned away.' I chose to ignore it and we went off to find our room. The whole tip thing became something of an irritation for the rest of our stay.

At 6am the next morning \u2013 when the Starbucks in the hotel itself was still closed (no facilities in the room either) \u2013 I went in search of a coffee. A bellhop in reception directed me to a Starbucks outside the hotel and promptly stuck his hand out for a tip. He didn't get one. The room itself was nothing special and didn't even come with coffee/tea making facilities. For $428 (before taxes) for one night, I expect more. We didn't dine in the hotel restaurant, but we did take breakfast the morning of our departure. That cost $60 for the three of us, and we didn't even go the whole hog \u2013 my wife only had a poached egg!

We were disappointed for the following reasons (I'm excerpting this from a letter that I'm sending the Waldorf): 1) Service - It seemed as though there was no structure to the service. There was no one there to greet people who had reservations for tea--no host or hostess. Everyone just sort of walked in and sat wherever. Our waiter was good, though. 2) Food - The finger sandwiches were medicore. The scones were good, but when we were brought our tray, it didn't have scones. The waiter said that there was some sort of delay and that he would bring the scones as soon as they were delivered. It turns out that we waited a good 30 minutes for them. 3) Tea - The tea was a bit weak, even after I let it steep for 10 minutes. Apparently, they put in too little tea and a lot of water into each customer's pot. 4) Level of formality - For a place like the Waldorf, you would think that there would be some standards of formality. However, there was absolutely no dress code for the tea. Also, the sugars were served in packets rather than lumps as I've seen in many afternoon tea services. One particular incident surprised me: A couple came in for tea, and a woman (who seemed as if she might be some sort of restaurant manager) with a flour-stained black skirt, abruptly informed them that she had no more tea strainers. I couldn't believe it. I mean, only about four tables in the whole place were occupied. Where the heck were the rest of the tea strainers?

I have never stayed in anything less than a suite, so I cannot comment on regular rooms. The best thing about this hotel is that it is half the price of other big name hotels (like the St. Regis, the Four Seasons, or Trump Towers). The suites are really quite large. The rooms I have stayed in have had large sitting rooms, often with two couches plus other seating, in addition to a desk and chair. The bedroom is often smaller, but comfortable, and the bathrooms can really vary in size depending on where you are located. The rooms can be inconsistent from room to room depending on what layout you get. Some rooms have a TV on a cart, while others have a full armoire. Some bathrooms have a large tub and a separate, small shower, while others are combos; still others have pedestal sinks and others have large dressing areas with vanities. Some rooms have butler pantries, which don't really add much functionality. Generally, no matter the layout, all the rooms are decorated with antiques or mock-antiques. I happen to like how the rooms are decorated with an older-world charm, reminiscent of the hotel's history. However, the rooms are definitely shabby. Cracking paint, scuffed furniture, old and poor-quality TVs, and shabby couches are often seen, but at least it is a NICE shabby couch. In other words, everything is high quality, but there is wear and tear. The air conditioning doesn't seem to be working wonderfully, though, as the rooms often got quite stuffy at night. Room service is really good, and they make a point of getting it to you fast and hot. Plus, the quality is above average. The concierge level has a nice breakfast in the morning and cocktails and appetizers in the evening, as well. Several of the restaurants in the hotel are quite good as well, including Bull and Bear and the Japanese restaurant. Service is impeccable, but not to over the top, as in, it's not St. Regis butler service. But the concierge was able to get us into Per Se on one day's notice after I tried unsuccessfully on my own, which is plain unheard of (typically takes a reservation over a month in advance to get in). The lobby is really nice, with beautiful fresh flower arrangements dutifully groomed daily, and the eclectic group of people, from businessmen to tourists to dignitaries, is fun to people-watch. Also, the location is really great, with proximity to all of midtown Manhattan and pretty easy access to subways. Overall, the hotel is a nice hotel at a nice price. It isn't as nice as the nicest hotels in New York, but a great compromise, especially if looking for a suite (these are large for New York) or an extended stay.

If you are looking for old world style in a convenient Midtown location, this is the place to stay. Are there swankier hotels in New York? Yes, I've stayed at several. Are there hotels with better rooms and/or facilities? Yes, I know from personal experience. Are there hotels with as much tradition and personality. Perhaps only a handful and that is debatable. From the minute you enter off of Lexington or Park Avenue, you know you've stepped into a special hotel. The lobby is a gargantuan, stately cavern with attentive staff and an excellent bar/lounge. The main entry hall is very impressive, leading up to the flower table they change every Monday morning. Venture up a few flights of stairs to the ballroom and see if you're not impressed. The point I'm making goes as follows: how many hotels do you visit where you spend part of your stay walking around to 'tour the grounds.' I can think of only a few. I have seen critcisms from other members as to the rooms. Since I base all of my reviews on my own personal experience, I can only comment that my room was excellent. I had a fantastic view of the city, a large King bed, a spacious room, and an updated-remodeled bathroom. Perhaps I missed the remodelling other members experienced... Service was prompt and curteous. I had to place two calls, one for drycleaning and one for room service, both of which were taken care of immediately. Location of the property is amazing. You're ten blocks away from Central Park and only a few from Midtown's shopping areas on 5th and Madison. You can walk to Broadway. You can walk to Grand Central. You can walk to the Rock. I can understand the criticism of expense by some members, but you have to bear in mind that 1) this is New York (where all accomodations are overpriced) and 2) this the WA, one of the original luxury hotels in the City.

I had the filet and my husband had the surf and turf. Yes, dinner was expensive but for something special this was the right place. I especially liked the area that the hotel was in. It was walking distance to time square etc, but it was out of all the madness. We found a great deli on 7th Ave and 50th street for breakfast. My husband and I will definitely stay at the Waldorf again. Also, the hotel's website is very helpful. We read almost the entire site and reviewed the menus before we went so there was no surprises as to cost.

The lobby is beautiful and check in line went quickly. When we got to our room and opened the door, a very strong odor hit us hard. Our porter agreed that we would have to make a room change, made a phone call, and returned with a hotel key to a standard rooom. The hotel night manager apologized for not having a comparable business class room, and offered us a much smaller deluxe room. We had no choice (we decided the smell was mold). We were told not to unpack, so that they could move our bags for us when a upgraded room became available the following day. Good thing we didn't unpack because the closet smelled awful, almost like moth balls, musty and moldy. We were gone for most of the next day and as instructed, went to the diamond reception office to pick up our keys to the new room. However, this arrangement was not complete and waited 20 minutes. When given permission to up, housekeeping was still cleaning the room. After waiting another 30 minutes for our luggage(and delaying our dinner plans) we had to call and wait an additional 10 minutes before it arrived. This room was quite nice. Beautifully decorated, no odor, great view of St Barts's church, spacious, a comfortable bed, and lovely art deco bathroom (the shower did not drain adequately). The complimentary continental breakfast was nice and you could choose from a variety of hot items for an additional $6.00 .The hotel is in a great location. Rockefeller Center, Grand Central, the UN building, Times Square, Theatre District and subway are within walking distance. Would I stay again? Probably not. Was it worth all our hotel reward points? No. This is a beautiful old building that needs some well deserved attention. For the prices they charge for accomodations, you would expect this hotel to be a well preserved landmark. The night manager was very nice, apologetic and went out of her way to find a shoe I left behind in the first room.

The room was clean, with lovely decoration, bed linen etc. No signs of the peeling wallpaper or mould others have mentioned. The bathroom was clean, marble and fresh paintwork stocked with toiletries etc. The heating seemed fine too, on/off and quite controllable, and anyone who saw the weather over the Easter break will know we needed warming up! Although we didn't eat in the hotel restaurants, we were made to feel free to wander, which we did up to the Ballroom, the Starlight Roof etc. The old world elegance was overwhelming in real life, the pictures really don't do it justice.

It was also my first visit to New York. Having encountered an un-pleasant visit through JFK airport (to be fair building work is going on) and a very unhelpful miserable taxi driver we parked up outside the hotel (legally) only to be told by a very rude member of staff to get out at the garage. Nothing of a welcome, hello, afternoon. The driver took us into the deserted dark garage round the back of the hotel where we unloaded our bags and tried to find reception which wasn't sign posted (luckily I sort of knew where to go as I read another report about this before we departed). We were taken into a private room to check in and went up to our room which was of the size I was expecting for $380/night not inc breakfast but it was in desperate need of a revamp for following reasons:- A lot of large brown stains all over the walls in the lounge room. Some panelling coming away from the wall. The air conditioning did not work except for blowing out hot air even at the lowest setting of 18 degrees. The shower head had come away from the wall. No hot water from the hot water tap in the washing basin. Considering the price I was surprised to find no complimentary drinks (not sure if this is isolated just to the Waldorf or for all hotels in New York). These problems didn't really bother us as we were only there for 2 nights and more interested in seeing what New York had to offer. Our main problem was a knocking noise coming from pipes inside the wall. It was a similar noise to trapped air in a home central heating system. It was quiet at first so didn't bother us but when we returned later that night it was louder. As we were shattered from a very long day we went to bed regardless. I woke up at 4.30am as the sound became unbearable. I called reception who confirmed it was a known problem with the hotels steam system during cold weather and there was nothing they could do about it. I couldn't quite believe they knew about the problem but still put us in the room regardless. No apology was provided but we were offered an alternative room but could only move into it after 3pm. As we couldn't put up with the noise we decided to get ready and start our sight seeing at 6am. On the 2nd night the noise wasn't too bad but it was warmer outside than the previous day. We were disturbed twice by staff who entered our room whilst occupied without ringing the bell (unless the bell didn't work). Bar staff and concierge were very friendly but the Bar Manager did drop a note to the pianist (via one of his staff) on the Saturday night to finish early which was disappointing as the pianist playing was superb. In fact many people stayed longer at the bar because of the pianist. I have stayed in far better 5 star hotels and would even go as saying I have stayed in better 3 star hotels. The prices were the only aspect I found of this hotel meeting a 5 star requirement and would advise booking in other 5 star hotels unless you are offered an extremely good deal.

We arrived by airport shuttle at the \"motor entrance\" to the Waldorf. The motor entrance was disappointing as we were let off in covered alley that was dirty, noisy, and confusing. In the modern era, no one is arriving by horse and carriage, and I doubt few are dragging their luggage down Park Avenue, so I am mystified why the motor entrance seemed to be an afterthought and an embarrasing one at that. The bellman was perfectly pleasant but pointed us in the direction of the hotel and we set off up a series of steps. The direction was not well marked and we did not see an elevator there. Once at the top of the second flight of stairs, we could see the lobby. The lobby was richly decorated in dark woods and colors that said \"old money\". There was a lovely flower arrangement in the hall that stood about five feet tall above the table. The staff at the reception desk was very pleasant and even apologized that our rooms were not ready at 11 am. We checked in, and left our cell phone number because the staff offered to call if our rooms were ready before 3pm (they did not call, and we received our room keys when we returned about 9pm). We asked the concierge where we could have a light lunch nearby. First, he called an Italian restaurant that did said they didn't open for a half hour. Next, he called another cafe just a block away, and told us they were open but did not accept reservations. Although, we asked specifically for salads and sandwiches, we arrived to find only a breakfast buffett and a staff that wouldn't even give us the lunch menu until after 12 noon. I was suprised that the Waldorf concierge had been unable to fulfill our simple request for a light lunch. We returned to the hotel about 9pm and presented our photo id in order to receive our rooms. We did have our 3 rooms in a row as requested. The rooms were small by modern standards, and one person's suitcase had to be kept in the closet. However, they were nicely appointed with a tv armoir, bench at the end of one bed, a desk with fax machine, and a walk-in closet. There was a little street noise on the 9th floor, but not enough to be distracting. The beds were made with feather pillows and a down duvet. When I called to ask that the bed be remade without feathers (serious allergies), the housekeeping office did not question and promised to send someone right away. The housekeeper arrived quickly and did the job, but seemed to be having a bad night as she spent much of her time in the room yelling into the walkie-talkie that she only had two hands and would get to the next room soon. Fortunately, that was the only time when the staff was less than pleasant. When we were checking out, we could not seem to find our way back to the motor entrance because the way out was not marked well, just as we were confused when we arrived. We ended up coming out of the lower hall at the Park Avenue entrance. The door man was very helpful and he had us wait there while he called the motor entrance and had our car brought around to us. I have to believe that this happens often. Overall, the Waldorf was pleasant, friendly atmosphere.

How sad to realize that this 'Old-NY institution' has become just an impersonal, kitschy, stuffy, boring and pretentious conference centre. Actually the first problems arose already at the moment of booking: the lady at the Hilton-reservation centre provided us quite a good rate for an 'executive-room' , expressly guaranteeing that this rate was inclusive of breakfast and that the room was on the 'executive floor', with access to the executive lounge. Once at the reception we were faced with the first very very disappointing surprise: the lady at the reservation centre had allegedly made a mistake (I wonder how it is possible??), we were told that at the Waldorf no executive floor exists(!!) but only a so called 'concierge floor', unfortunately our booking did not allow us to stay at this floor. Furthermore the lady at the reception informed us that the breakfast was not included in the rate, neither was any of the facilities mentioned at the moment of the reservation. No one seemed able or willing to explain the reason for this irritating situation, the receptionist even seemed to imply that we were lying. Absolutely disgraceful! No apology was rendered. No solution was offered. Even worse: although we were willing to pay for an upgrade to stay at the concierge room this proved impossible, because the floor was fully booked! No alternative accommodation was offered. At that point we were, of course, already quite disappointed but the worst was still to come. The room was decent, not too small for NY-standards but definitely and absolutely in need of some improvements..stuffy, signs of age were visible which can barely be tolerated in a 3 star hotel but are unthinkable in a 4 or 5 stars. The service was simply not what you expect from an hotel like Waldorf Astoria. To say the least. On the wedding day my fiance ordered champagne and strawberries to be delivered at midnight, great thought...too bad that the champagne was actually delivered at 2 p.m., just when I was about to leave for the ceremony and therefore remained on the small table, in the room, getting warm until the moment when we finally got back to the room..at about midnight. Of course the mini-bar was too 'mini' for the bottle to fit. Luckily there was an ice-machine in the corridor. Still a better faith than the small treat sent by one of our witnesses which she expressly asked to have delivered to our room on the same day, together with a card, both the treat and the card never arrived at destination. Again no apologies, just a mumbled 'there must have been a mistake'...yeah, there must have been. Last but not least: when checking out I forgot a pair of nice lammy-gloves (a present to which I was very attached to) in our room. When the day after somebody of our wedding-party went to collect them...nobody knew anything about them and nobody had seen them. Yes, plenty of mistakes, a bit too many.

The reception staff were so helpful and even arranged for our rooms to be next to each other.

With that, I decided to stay at The Waldorf on my next vacation to NYC, with the hope of experiencing \"an old world charm\" right on Park Avenue. After logging on to the hotel's website, everything looked great. Duh! They probably photoshopped it . With the hope of finding a good deal, I logged on to Expedia and got myself quite a good deal for a standard room at The Waldorf Astoria. I requested an early checkin as my flight from Bangkok arrives JFK at 7:00 in the morning. Arriving at the hotel, my first impression was that it looked quite old from the outside. But of course you can't judge a book by the cover! Cars are not allowed to park in front (on Park Avenue) to unload your baggages, instead you are directed to this damp crappy basement area, and have to find your way up to the lobby with no one to welcome you. (Remember, this is a 5 star!) Arriving at the lobby, I thought that this was Times Square, because it was soooo crowded. I can tell that only 20% of the people there were hotel guests. People taking pictures, posing with that \"famous clock\", walking around, kids shouting. The scene was quite chaotic, and I am not exaggerating. Nevertheless, we checked in and was told that the room is not yet ready since it's only 9 am in the morning. Since I am Hilton HHonors Gold, they were nice enough to upgrade me to the \"Waldorf Towers\" floor, and provided me with complimentary breakfast everyday. Shortly, I was taken to my room on the 42nd floor. The room was ok... but a very small size, not like the pics on the website at all! It's old...yes, but at least there were no cockroaches or spider webs. Like I said, the room was ok. It's just that I find it a bit too small. The bathroom was acceptable, and was of moderate size. Service is quite good though. I think that all the maids were trained to greet and sorta bow down on you everytime you walk pass them. The beds however, were extremely comfortable...I should've checked for the brand of the mattress. All in all, I am satisfied with my stay at The Waldorf, but was not impressed. Maybe all the fuzzes that I heard about it were overly exaggerated. If you expect this hotel to be like The St. Regis or The Four Seasons, then do not ocme here, because it is NOT. ** RESTAURANT REVIEWS** The Waldorf actually has a collection of many good restaurants, and I had a chance to dine in 2 of them. Bull and Bear Steakhouse (Formal) This is a really nice restaurant with a warm and romantic atmosphere. The restaurant itself is quite elegant, mainly from the decorations and the people that dines there. Great steaks! Very well prepared and the service was really nice. The restaurant is divided into two sections, the bar and the restaurant. I recommend the New York Strip! Oscar's American Brasserie (Casual) This is where I had my breakfast in the morning. Although it is always very busy, and you have to wait at an average of 15 minutes to get a seat, the staff are excellent in making sure that your water/orange juice gets refilled instantly. Great buffet, very wide variety and the ingredients are fresh. The food is quite good that you wouldn't really mind the busy, loud noises.", "Date": "March 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cImpressed!\u201d", "Author": "lncd515", "ReviewID": "UR6849458", "Content": "I have always wanted to stay at this famous hotel, and am extremely glad that I did.

The saving made paid for a very nice dinner. Of course there may be times when the hotel desk can obtain tickets that are simply not available, but it is certainly worth checking our first. Oscars breakfast was average so we chose to eat out on most occaisions, including lunch at Gordan Ramsay which was excellent and despite not having any stars was every bit as good as his London restaurant in Royal Hospital Road, and it was great to see that some of the staff were direct from his UK operation.

It was busy but, after all, this was the holiday period AND New York so what else do you expect? We found an amazing deal - $279 per night through AAA - so I assume we were in one of the least prestigous rooms in the hotel (the front desk guy told me there are over 1400 rooms). Despite being the 'poor cousins', I am left with the overwhelming impression of comfort and history. The room was pretty average sized, but the sheets were soft and the doona/comforter/duvet and pillows were oh-so-luxurious. The spacious bathroom was clean, the towels and huge floor mat were super plush, the toilet tissue was thick and soft (I'm sure you wanted to know that). There was plenty of storage space in the room so that we weren't stepping over ourselves to move around the room and all the fittings were in top condition and worked (which isn't aways the case in other hotels). The room didn't smell of anything; not smoke, not dampness, not horrible airfreshners; we couldn't hear noises from the neighbouring rooms and we had control of the air conditioning. On a more superficial note; the decor was homey and tasteful without being 'musak for the eyes'. The TV included internet access, however I didn't try it out. Instead, I used the business center downstairs (which was expensive but efficient). The 'fridge had a well stocked mini bar and the coffee supplied for the coffee maker was a really nice medium blend. Unfortunately we were only supplied with coffee whitener instead milk or cream, but there is a little deli across the road (Dominicas) where we could buy fresh milk and as we left each day, which picked up a treat-coffee from the Starbucks shop inside the front entrance of the building. The staff were all great: helpful, attentive, polite and sometimes charming, only one of them was snooty-polite; the rest were quite down to earth. Each day our room was cleaned nicely. We don't come from a tipping culture so I wasn't sure how much tip we should leave in the room each day (so we left about $3), but it didn't seem to affect the quality of the room cleaning (which is not always the case). The history of the place made it an extra special place to stay and you can feel it the minute you walk into the building. There have been movies set in the Waldorf, (eg 1945 'Week-End at the Waldorf ' or 2004 'Alfie') so it might enhance the experience to watch these movies before you stay at the hotel. Once you get there, check out the mosaic floors in the entrance and the art deco decor throughout the building. I regret that we didn't find some reason to spend some time sitting in the waiting chairs of the lobby and reception to enjoy the view and soak up the ambiance. Another great feature of the hotel is it's centrall location. It is one of the route stops of the grey line hop-on-hop-off bus tour. Its also a pleasant walk to central park. If you're comfortable walking a mile or so, you can easily get to HEAPs of NY attractions, including Empire State Building, Rockerfella centre, St Pat's Cathedral, Times Square, The United Nations and a large chunk of the Broadway theatres. Having said all that about the Waldorf Astoria, I'd be happy to pay $100 less per nite and catch the subway into the city each day from Brooklyn or New Jersey. But, as a once-in-a-lifetime treat, it was definitely worth it.", "Date": "January 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOver-rated\u201d", "Author": "ChristineZac", "ReviewID": "UR6550724", "Content": "Have just returned from a five night stay at the Waldorf (28th December - 2nd January) I have to say how disappointed I was with the hotel. Travelled with family (2 adults + 2 teenagers) for the New Year Period. On arrival the hotel lobby was absolutely jam-packed full of people waiting to check in. We had to wait a couple of hours for the room to be ready. We paid top rate even though we booked directly with the hotel and felt that it was not worth the money. Yes, the first impression was \"wow\" on entering the building but after seeing the room this was not the case. The room was a \"deluxe\" double-bedded room which for four people was certainly not adequate. The bathroom was tiny (and dusty round the edges) and the bedroom definately needed up-dating. I appreciate that it is art deco style but it didn't quite work. I didn't feel that there was any personal attention, I think we were just numbers and nobody actually asked if we had enjoyed our stay as they will fill the hotel regardless. I would look at other \"boutique\" type hotels for our next visit. We went to Gordon Ramsey's new restaurant at the London NYC and that was really smart. If you have the money stay there as the hotel and location is fantastic. Also the Palace hotel looked very nice, but again probably more expendsive than the Waldorf. Having said all the above - New York is a fantastic place to visit. We booked tickets for the Empire State Building on line but still had to queue up for about 30 minutes to actually get in the building but you then bypass the ticket office. Also I would suggest booking tickets for the Statue of Liberty as to go in the Statue they only allocate so many tickets per day, although you can still visit the island. Also went to the top of the Rockefeller Centre which was fantastic and I thought better than the Empire State. Central Park was lovely but the carriage ride was a rip-off as you only do a 20 minute circuit for 40$. Grand Central was well worth a visit as was SoHo for shopping as well as Macy's and Bloomingdales. My husband and son went to the Natural History Museum which they really enjoyed, they were there for quite a few hours! We travelled on the subway quite comfortably and didn't feel anxious as I would have expected. Finally on arrival we caught the train from Newark to Penn Street Station and then took a taxi to the Waldorf. Coming back we hopped on a coach (Newark Express) at 42nd street which runs every 15 minutes for $14 per person, as taxis are very expensive.

However, I was particpating in my one of my best friend's wedding, which was at the Waldorf (and all of his wedding-related activities were held at or near the Waldorf) Thus, I opted to stay there for the primary reason of convenience. I stayed at the Waldorf for five nights in mid-October. For two of the nights I paid the rate quoted on the hilton homepage. The remaining three nights I used hilton points. I arrived at the hotel and the taxi driver dropped me off at the wrong entrance. It was a side entrance and there was no staff to help me with my luggage. I entered the hotel and upon entering, a staff member asked if I was staying at the Waldorf. When I replied, \"yes,\" he welcomed me and took my luggage for me. I checked-in very quickly at the reception desk. The person who checked me in was very friendly and upgraded me for the first two nights to a luxury suite. The suite was beautiful and very spacious! It was like a large three room apartment, probably about 1500 square feet total. There were three separate rooms in the suite and a large foyer area. One room was a sitting area with a large couch, two chairs, a fireplace, a TV, desk, fax, etc. The second room was the bedroom with a king size bed, large TV, two chairs, nightstands, etc. Also, there was a walk-in closet with a secure safe in the bedroom. Very spacious for NY. The last room was the vanity and changing area and bathroom. This area included a sitting area for the ladies to \"freshen up,\" two good size closets, large floor to wall mirrors on both closet doors, a changing area, and the bathroom. The bathroom had a separate shower, a bathtub, and was alot of space for all of your toiletries, etc. There were a fair number of windows in the suite and they did provide a nice \"city\" view of the street, buildings, etc. Best of all, the suite was very clean and the carpet felt like it was just shampooed. I was very pleased with the suite and after two days had to check-out. I had a separate reservation for the remaining three nights b/c I had used my hilton points. When I checked out, I went to the Diamond reception desk for Hilton Diamond members. I had to check out by 12 and could not check back in to my new room until 3 pm and I didn't want to lug my luggage out of my old room for just three hours. So, the Waldorf staff had me leave my bags in the suite and they aranged for my bags to be moved into my new room. My new room was a double executive room. When I entered my room, my luggage was waiting for me. The room, of course, was alot smaller than the suite. I had a friend stay with me in the double and it did become a little \"crowded\" in the bathroom. The bathroom was small, not very much space for makeup, toiletries, etc. However, I did think that the size of the double room was sufficient/pretty good considering that it was in NYC. The room, again, was very clean. I also received two free coupons for the breakfast buffet at the restaurant Oscar's. You can upgrade the breakfast for a small charge and they serve freshly squeezed orange juice with FREE REFILLS! The food was pretty good and they have a pretty decent selection at the buffet. It gets crowded very quickly though, but the wait is typically no longer than 5 minutes. For those room service fanatics like me, the room service was good, but nothing special. I ordered room service on three occassions. The food was good, but nothing extraordinary. The service was prompt and friendly. The prices are a little higher than usual, but this is the Waldorf and NYC... I expected that much. One more thing. the LOCATION IS GREAT!!!! It is near the shopping areas, alot of great restaurants, day spas, etc. There are only a couple things that I would say were \"negatives\" about the Waldorf. 1. Because it is the Waldorf, it is ALWAYS crowded and somewhat noisy, at least in the reception/main foyer area. There are ALWAYS people taking pictures, or just hanging around in the reception area. Also, I didn't have to use the conceirge service at all, but I noticed that there was almost always a line when I passed by. Thus, the hotel isn't really \"low-key.\" If you like the \"bustling\" atmosphere, then this wouldn't bother you. 2. The hotel can get noisy. When I was in the double room, I could hear alot of the traffic and honking from outside. But again, it's NYC and the hotel is located right off Park Ave. 3. The room temperature controls were not that great. They have some old heating/cooling system in place. I typically like the room a little toasty, but the heat did not work very well. It blew out, at best, lukewarm air. All in all, I was pleased with the Waldorf. It's a beautiful hotel. The hotel is probably best known b/c of its reputation/history and architecture, and that's probably one of the primary things that sets the Waldorf apart from other hotels. In all honesty, I don't think the Waldof is that much different from any of the other top hotels that I've been to.

We booked the room 6 months ago and when we got there we asked for an upgrade if they had any available, which they did. When we arrived in our room we were a little concerned as to what our non-upgraded room may have looked like. This was one of the smallest rooms I have ever stayed in and our view was of the aircon units servicing the building. As they had no other rooms to offer we decided to make the most of it and went out for dinner. When we went to bed I woke an hour later to the aircon generators stopping and starting on rotation like they were in he room which us. Then on top of that our room was close to elevators which ping twice when someone gets of on your floor - I swear every person in NYC was staying on our floor - that lift pinged twice on and off consistently between 1.30 and 3.30.

This then continued for the rest of the morning until we gave up trying to sleep and got up. We complained, but as we had booked thru an agent they could refund the room rate, which I will now never do again as you have no come back. So we are trying to get a free stay in another Hilton Group hotel closer to home. But as the previous poster said, it would surprise me if we ever heard back. If you are looking for somewhere special to stay DO NOT STAY in the Waldorf Astoria - it is completely rubbish and the most expensive worst nights sleep I have ever had!!!!!!", "Date": "October 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, UK", "Title": "\u201cIconic hotel in need of a good wash and paint\u201d", "Author": "Mattperks", "ReviewID": "UR5934632", "Content": "I read a mixed bag of reviews on the Waldorf but as it is an iconic hotel and somewhere i have always wanted to stay i thought i would give it a go.

On the day of travel one of my companions was unable to travel due to illness, which was ok as we were able to get our money back from the insurance companey, However we had a non refundable booking as such i asked the hotel if we could have an upgrade as we only needed the one room. i was told the Hotel was already \"over comitted\" and it was impossible...later to find out in the bar from a couple who had complained that there room had been changed 3 times before they had one they were satisfied with on that day. There were several things that ruined the break, the room not being made up twice! having been out for a full 10 hours sight seeing, trying to charge us $40 for some tea bags that should have been in the mini bar and the lack of newspaper on two mornings...minor things that i wouldn't worry about normally but together it was very annoying as was the apathy displayed by the hotel. On departure i highlighted all of these things to the management and was offered 2 nights free accomadation if i go back, which is ok but it means them getting more of my money. At the rates charged you can get better value the rooms are dated and i didn't feel the hotel was that clean, there was a table outside the restraunt covered in dust!

It was very nice to have a biz meeting at the bar overlooking the lobby with a piano player, the lobby is quite nice, the gym was reasonable for a hotel and there are many dining options in the hotel. The hotel provided either a coffee maker or free coffee or tea delivered to your door anytime. The wide hallways are unusual except for the older hotels of which there are not many left in NYC and it does have great history and a touch of old world charm. I think it a bit unfair when folks say the hotel needs a billion dollar renovation. This hotel is no longer a five star hotel but it is also not charging five star prices. Rooms at The Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton and St Regis normally start at almost twice the rate or more than The Waldorf. You do get what you pay for. If you are looking for old world charm at a reasonable price for NYC this is a good hotel. If you want all the bells and whistles while also getting old world charm be prepared to pay alot more. In sum this hotel has some problems however as long as they continue to price their rooms on par with or alittle above other 4 star hotels I think it is worth it.

The first room they gave us was pretty big for NY and pretty, but there was a low, thudding noise coming from the hotels huge airconditioning unit or something which was outside just on the same level as the room. I knew I would not be able to sleep in that noise so we asked for another room. I could not help thinking that this was the room they automatically offer to first-timers who don\u2019t know about the noise problem in that room. The next room was in the Astoria Tower and it smelled like tobacco smoke. As we had been confirmed a non-smoking room we asked for a 3rd room.. The 3rd one did not smell of tobacco and was otherwise ok too. It just took a lot of time and energy to get a proper room. And I have never had to ask for another room before, despite loads of travelling around the world. As I have seen in another hotel with a prestigeous past the staff can be a bit snooty. And they seem to pop into your room rather often. We had put some bread and cheese in the minibar and were \"scolded\" by someone whose job seemed to be just popping in to your room to have a look at the minibar, in the evening of your 1-day stay.. Why not at the end of your stay? Another snooty example from the breakfast restaurant where we were rushed to the table and hastily asked \"have you been here before?\" in the meaning that do you know how this works. So they have many options for breakfast which come with their do's and don'ts, so the first thing in the morning (before your morning coffee ;-) ! ) you have to be sharp, focused and fast and absorb the rules. Why don't they just simplify things?! One breakfast type in one buffet table etc. It seems to be that \"this is the way we have always done things\" and you just need to read through the hotel manual so that you know what to do and where.

It was definitely not what I expected from a world-famous hotel. I had always heard about how fabulous this hotel was but I was truly disappointed. From the time I arrived at the Park Avenue entrance there were problems. Bad entrance. Check-in was a nightmare with a long line of people waiting to check-in. Even though at least 5 people were working the check-in desk, the wait was terribly long. I was given a room on the 13th floor. The hotel was so confusing that I simply could not find the room ( ever). I finally found a phone on the wall and called the front desk and they sent someone upstairs to find me. The halls, while spacious, are very shabby and confusing. There are also two banks of elevators which the front desk does not tell guests about. The two banks of elevators service different floors and arrive in different parts of the lobby. My room was ok but small for a 5 star hotel. It looked like a room from the early 1900s. The furniture was old and shabby in a chic way but there was too much furniture for such a small room. There was a cabinet with a large tv in it. However, when the doors of the cabinet were open so that the tv could be seen, I was not able to get from the window side of the room to the bathroom/closet side of the room. I had to close the cabinet, move around the room and then open the cabinet again and then repeat the process every time I wanted to move to the other side of the room. There was a luggage rack in the room ( stored inside the closet) However, when taken out of the closet and set up to hold a suitcase, there was no place in the room ( except in front of the closet) to put the luggage rack. So everytime I wanted to get something out of the closet or put something into the closet, I had to move my suitcase. The bathroom was adequate but small. There was no inroom safe. The front desk has safes, but who wants to battle that line again? About room service--THE MOST EXPENSIVE I HAVE EVER SEEN. I ordered room service twice. Once I had a piece of cake and a scoop of ice cream and it was $40. The next morning I had breakfast-toast, orange juice and bacon and it was over $50. Too expensive-- the toast was cold and burned--I sent it back twice before I finally gave up. For the price of the rooms at this hotel, I would stay someplace else.

Boy! Our stay was so completely opposite of the bad reviews I've read here recently. Before booking our stay there I was very hesitant about the Waldorf since so many people had bad things to say. Our experience was nothing but the best! We arrived into LaGuardia around 12:30 p.m. and rented a car and drove in. Used the valet parking at the hotel which was pricey at $45 as I recall but quite simple to do. There was NO line at the reception desk and we walked right up to the counter. The woman behind the desk couldn't have been any nicer or accommodating and had the bellman take our bags and let us check right in even though we were a couple of hours early for the normal check-in time of 3:00 p.m. We were in Suite 10A the 10th floor corner (a corner in from the corner directly on Park Avenue) and both the bedroom and living room overlooked the dome of St. Batholomew's and down on the Cafe St. Barths where we planned on having a family reunion that evening. I guess we lucked out because the suite was beautiful. There was no chipped paint, no threadbare furniture in the room, the marble bath was new and beautiful, no smells in the corridors, etc. Both rooms were quite large with a VERY large walk-in closet and the bathroom had lovely Evelyn and Crabtree toiletries. The only negative comment I could make (and did make to the hotel after our stay when they requested any comments) was that in the bathroom the air circulation vent (which was located under the full size bathroom window) needed cleaning. We took a tissue and did clean out of vent the best we could, but this was no big deal. We like it cool and set the ac in all the rooms to the lowest setting and it was quite adequate. The following morning we had friends over and entertained them in the living room and ordered up from room service coffe and tea service for six people (which came to over $50), but was so convenient having them roll in a beautiful tray with coffee, tea, cups and silver spoons. Went down early in the a.m. and got from Starbucks (which is tucked away down a little flight of stairs on the left hand side when entering the hotel from the Park Avenue entrance) some pastries to go with the coffee & tea from service. Having lived in Manhattan for 20 years from 1970-1990 I was quite familiar with the beautiful grand lobby of the Waldorf and the only miniscule negative comment I might make is that one of the arms of the lobby chairs I sat in across from Harry's Bar was threadbare . . . and that would be about my only other negative comment. Oh! Almost forgot, there was one other thing that puzzled me. We did have turn down service at night (which I made sure we had because I called downstairs to request it) and it was done, however, there was no chocolate left on the pillow. Not a huge deal, of course, but most better hotels, cruise ships, etc., do make it a practice of doing that. Well, there you have it. Whether we lucked out or not, I don't know, but I can say our one-bedroom suite was really lovely and beautiful, IF you like the heavy gold drape, damask furniture look, which we do.

The hotel felt like it was being cooled with a swamp cooler. The room was cool, but not cold, and it was dank. There was a major heat wave and I guess the ancient cooling systems in the hotel could not keep up. The bathroom was borderline gross with flaking paint on the ceiling and chips in the tub.

Upon entering, the lobby is nice - nothing out of this world, but that is about as good as it gets. We stayed on the 12th floor. When we got off of the elevator to the 12th floor, there was a stinch that reminded you of an elderly nursing home. It appeared that it was being covered up by a whole can of Lysol. The wallpaper was peeling, and the lighting was quite dim. Finally, we entered the room. If you love old elegance, this might be the place for you, but it is done on a budget. Our room had a huge square cut out in the ceiling. It looks as though it had been sheet rocked and painted. The comforters had blood stains on the backs of them. It was very stuffy in the room, and even with the air on it was still quite humid. Don't even try to wash your hair in the shower, as the water pressure is tooooo low. The rooms were very dusty. Dust was flying everywhere. I went to the Front Desk Manager to ask for a refund, and to see about moving to another hotel. I told him that in my opinion the hotel appeared to be an overpriced LaQuinta. Even on a good day, a brand new LaQuinta would give the Waldorf a run for its money. Needless to say, he would not give give us a refund for the 3rd night stay. The first 2 nights were on Hilton Honors points. BEWARE-even if you do have points, do not waste them here.

By 5 stars I son't simply mean the dated decor and furniture of the rooms, or the peeling and frayed plaster of the corridors, i also refer to service - which was polite, but only polite. I asked the concierge about a rental car, he gave me the telephone number of Hertz! I was locked out of my room - because the key they gave me stopped working - the staff demanded I return to reception - which is quite a long way - they only came to the room to let me in on my insistence. There were too many instances of this type of service over just 3 days. Finally to top it off, they over charged me on the room rate!! Different to the reservation - they did refund this - but not immediately - I had to wait a month and provide them with a copy of my reservation - they obviously didn't have a copy themselves. So they were a few problems with my stay, a few problems with the service and with standard and maintenance of the decor! And don't forget the famous NYC water pressure in the shower - issues that the Waldorf shares. I would also like to point out to a previous reviewer on this hotel, that it IS INDEED possible to have old antique furniture and fixtures and fittings and for them to be in good good condiditon. The fact of the age of the hotel etc does not excuse the frankly shabby furnishings and decoration not just in the rooms but also the corridors etc. So although i loved my stay!!

The form for redeeming the room with points was in my luggage, and the clerk told us not to worry. I exchanged the luggage chit for the room key and off we went. Our room, 14H, was a corner suite. There was a marble foyer with a wet bar; a sitting room with sofa, chairs, fireplace and built in bookcases (with books); a bedroom with a four poster king size bed and a walk in closet with two robes; a dressing room with a make up table, fainting sofa and a five foot by seven foot floor standing mirror; and a marble tiled bathroom with his and her sinks, a shower in a tub AND a shower stall (with five nozzles) and the toilet ~in~ a closet. The windows inthe various rooms looked out on Park Ave except for one in the living room which overlooked 49th St. and down Park Ave. to the Met Life building. Just a few minutes after we arrived there was a buzz at the doorbell (!) and a bellman arrived with our luggage. He carried all the bags into the dressing room where he unfolded the luggage stands and set our suitcases on top of them. When I couldn't find my jacket with my wallet to tip him he waved \"no thanks\" and let himself out of the door. On a table in the living room was a tray with an ice bucket and a bottle of Waldorf-Astoria Champagne, a plate of chocolate dipped strawberries, two flutes and a note from the general manager thanking us (!) for choosing to spend our wedding night with them. We sat on the sofa and sipped our champagne, ate the berries and relaxed our first night as husband and wife. Just as we were finishing the doorbell rang again and another (!) bottle of champagne and plate of strawberries were delievered. The note on this tray was from the clerk who checked us in. I ordered a room service breakfast, hung the card on the door, and we put the second bottle and berries in the fridge in the wet bar for the morning. The bed was wonderfully comfortable. In the morning our breakfast was delivered at the exact time we had checked on the form, and though I laughed a lot at the $73 charge for six muffins, two glasses of juice and a pot of coffee, it was worth every penny. The cart was wheeled in with a linen tablecloth and napkins. Two folding leaves easily opened up to make it a nice size table. The butter was in an urn sitting atop a pile of ice to keep it chilled. The muffins melted in my mouth and the croissants so buttery they didn't need any more. There was real cream for the coffee, which was rich and dark. The silverwear was heavy and the plates monogramed with the distinctive Waldorf-Astoria logo. We enjoyed a leisurley breakfast, and then opened the other bottle of champagne and ate the strawberries in a hobbittlike second breakfast. I called and inquired about a late check out, but was told none was available. We didn't vacate the room until about 12:30, which was still fine with us and no on had any issue with that at all. As we were leaving the room I opened the card that came with the second bottle of champagne. In it was a coupon for breakfast for two at Oscar's, one of the restaurants on site. When we were checking out in the lobby I mentioned to the clerk that we hadn't used it because we'd ordered room service and he converted it to lunch for two. We gave our bags to a bellman and walked around the city a bit before heading to lunch. There was no problem using the coupon, which included both an appetizer and an entree. We, of course, had to try a Waldorf salad. We went to retrieve our bags in the bowels of the building and thought we would have to then roll them out front to Park Ave where the car to take us to the airport was supposed to meet us. The bellman asked us our name and who the car service was, told us to have a seat and he called the service, the car materialized in the undergound passageway, the bags were loaded in the trunk and the rear door was held open for my wife. What incomparable service! I know our experience is not the norm, but we didn't want the norm when we planned to spend our wedding night at the Waldorf-Astoria. Every person we encountered there, from bellmen to desk clerks to the bartender in the restaurant was polite to a fault, gracious and warm.

This is actually the second time we have stayed here and both times we were very pleased with our choice of hotel. We origninally had reservations for the Grand Hyatt by Grand Central Station, just to try something new, but we cancelled them and chose the Waldorf instead. We are so glad we did, as we walked to the Grand Hyatt while staying at the Astoria, just to see what we missed. The Grand Hyatt is contemporary in style and the lobby was chaotic and frenetic- not at all our taste. We were glad to get back to the Waldorf. The ambiance at the Waldorf is so tasteful, refined and definitely old-school elegance. We realize that this is not everyone's choice, but I mention it to help others decide where they \"fit in.\" We arrived early for check-in- about 1 PM, and were able to get a room immediately, this on a Sunday. Our room, as seen by the photos, is what the Astoria considers a Queen Deluxe. It was quite satisfactory for us- comfortable bed, and the bathroom, while not large, was quite adequate. One thing people should know is that this hotel is on an older heating/AC system. If the hotel chooses to have it on AC that day, then you will not be able to get heat. Guest services, however, will be happy to send up a space heater for you. (I believe that is proper term.) Since this was a cooler spring day than normal, we thought we might need one, but the bedding was quite adequate as far as warmth goes, and we did not need it. While here, we attended an Andre Rieu concert at Radio City Music Hall (stupendous!) and we were happy to be within walking distance of RCMH. As you walk along 50th street to RCMH, you pass Rockefeller Center, so you can stop off there (which we did). You also pass St. Patrick's Cathedral while walking to RCMH and it was open for visitors on that side, as we passed. We also walked to Grand Central Station, and that is certainly do-able, but I recommend doing it along Lexington Avenue, versus Park Avenue. The Empire State Building is close to there as well. The service at the Waldorf was impeccable. All of the staff we encountered were courteous, warm and gracious. We ate at both the Bull and Bear, which we highly recommend. If you love steaks, then this is a good choice of restaurant. We also ate at Oscar's for both breakfast and lunch and found the food here to be quite tasty. We found that using Zip Check out, by phone, was the easiest. We first contacted the bellman's desk. They came for our luggage, stored it and then we could enjoy the city before we took our train later that afternoon. When it came time to leave, we simply went to the garage area where the bellman obtained our luggage and hailed us a taxi, which took us to Penn Station where we got our train. So, in short, we had a hassle free check-in and check-out. I realize this hotel tends to be more expensive than many in the midtown area of NYC, but I have Hilton Honors (Astoria is a Hilton run hotel) and I frequently get brochures advertising specials, one of which I used this time. Spring is a good time to go, it seems, as well as summer, and both seem to have more specials then. Online, just visit (---) .

I checked in by telephone on the first day of our stay and was advised that the keys to our suite would be ready for collection in the Diamond VIP area at the rear of the main lobby (I hasten to add that I am not a VIP, but they use this for express check in). The person (Paolo) I spoke to on the phone could not have been more accommodating or helpful. I mentioned that it was my Mum's birthday and asked if I could arrange for a birthday card or something to be put in the room - Paolo said he would take care of it. We arrived at the Waldorf at midday after checking out of the Salisbury. The room wasn't available, but our luggage was stored until we returned later. We spent the afternoon having lunch at Fraunces Tavern and visiting the museum there, returning to the hotel at about 5.45pm. Paolo got our keys ready and we went up to our suite on the 27th floor. The suite itself was amazing - marble-floored hallway, art deco bar area, sitting room with 2 sofas and several chairs and two bedrooms, both huge and with two double beds in each. Each bedroom was en-suite and had a small dressing area. We also had superb views over Park Avenue, Rockefeller Centre and St Patrick's Cathedral. I was disappointed that there was no birthday card as I had arranged, but this was explained when a trolley arrived at 8.30pm that evening with a complimentary bottle of champagne on ice, chocolate dipped strawberries, mineral water and a huge tray of fresh fruit. I was absolutely delighted that the birthday treat for my Mum had worked out so well. We were treated like royalty throughout our stay and particularly enjoyed a meal on the second night in Oscar's Restaurant (just off the Lexington Avenue entrance). We were waited on by Taner, who made it a wonderful experience. I could not have hoped for a better way for my Mum to celebrate her birthday and will have no hesitation in returning to the Waldorf again. We couldn't have wished for anything more.", "Date": "May 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Farncombe, Surrey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5046508", "Content": "Check-in was quick and smooth and the receptionist wished me a happy birthday for the following day and offered us a complimentary breakfast.

We had read all the reviews, and were see sawing between the Sofitel or the W=A. After I found a great rate for the concierge level, we opted to have the grand old NY experience at the Waldorf. Our stay was wonderful. It was not a Ritz Carlton or a 5 star property, but neither did it cost that much. The concierge staff for the Towers, which is available to Astoria level guests, were fantastic. We had the concierge staff arrange our reservations prior to the trip as I ended up running out of time. We were pleased with ALL of the dinners we had. The staff also accomodated us on a number of small requests. They also arranged for late check out and allowed us to continue using the Astoria lounge after checkout because we had a late flight. (This is non-chronological, but check in was a breeze via the telephone express registration and then the diamond reception desk). The private entrance/elevators were an absolute necessity. I do not think we would have enjoyed our stay had we not been on the concierge floor. The lobby/main entrance is often crowded, and the poor people catching taxis at the front door had a hard time of it, especially in the rain. We never had to wait longer than a minute for our doormean to hail us a taxi, and they also provided umbrellas in the rain. The lounge was very comfortable. Non alcoholic beverages were comped. We were there for the breakfast and \"tea\" food presentations. Breakfast was typical continental fare--bagels, pastries, fresh fruit, cereals, fresh squeezed juice. There was no espresso, but the starbucks downstairs was quick. The tea/dinner/hors d'ouevres service was different both nights. They had a number of salads (including the \"Waldorf Salad\" one night), cheese trays, olives, some cured meats, some light appetizers. It would provide an ample meal if for some reason you couldn't make it to a restaurant. Or would tide you over pre-theater. For us, it was great as a cocktail snack when we had later dinner reservations. The alcoholic beverages were typically priced, but they did give a fair pour, which sadly in these days, few places do. The room itself was quite nice as well. Our curiousity actually got the better of us and we took a tour of the Sofitel--our room was significantly bigger. Certainly not huge, but large by NYC standards is the fair assessment. The bathroom was not particularly luxe--perhaps it had been, many years ago, but today we are spoiled by huge expanses. My mother and I debated the tub issue and decided that in truth it would be a sin to redo those bathrooms. Perhaps the enamel has cracked in the tubs, but they just don't make them like that anymore (and I am in the plumbing business!). A cast iron tub that heavy is a luxury in itself, despite a few beauty marks. Incidentally, they had updated the shower heads, and nothing beats a Speakman shower. We must have been in a renovated room--we didn't see any damage to the carpet, plaster, or wall paper, The draperies and bedding and upholstery were all in excelllent condition. The air conditioning was not the greatest, but sufficed. The street noise was not bad on the 26th floor. The bed itself was exceedingly comfortable. Great mattress, nice pillows, very sof triple sheeting, and the perfect weight down duvet. Oh--there was an eveing turn down if thats important... OUr final decision on the hotel was this:if you want to stay in a four star property in Midtown, a room in the Towers/on the concierge floor is your best bet. If you can't get a room in the towers/concierge, stay at the Sofitel. And if you want FIVE star service, then stay at the Ritz and be willing to pay for it.", "Date": "April 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey, England", "Title": "\u201cLOVED IT!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5003280", "Content": "We stayed over Easter, absolutely no problem checking in, we arrived early and they still accommodated us straight away with no fuss and no waiting.

For seasoned travellers, the Waldorf is nothing more than a nice hotel in New York City, certainly not worth a (5) star rating, due to the fact that the hotel is still clinging to the glamor of the 50's. We had some major issues with check in, incorrect rooming and misleading staff, however after directing my complaint further, we were moved, although the heating did not work, even after numerous maintenence calls to repair. The room itself was very unimpressive, small, and we had paid for one level under top room rate. Although this sounds odd...the carpeted floor was VERY slippery to the point that you could slip over if step in the wrong direction. We expected to see elegance and grandeur, however this did not exist past the lobby, and even this felt a little dated. The location is great if you want to be close to Times Square without being in Times Square and Broadway, and we walked this many times. The Peacock Alley restaurant is nice, although you really are stuck right in the middle of the lobby, and do not feel romantic or special, rather alike being at a bistro on the main street. The food was absolutely brilliant without a doubt, however you will pay for it, as with most restaurants in New York City. The restaurant manager is SUPERB, the most decent, genuine, professional man, in that after some issues, we were content with the level of service we had received and continue to praise him. If you love traditional Japanese, head to Honmura Ann in Soho, amazing food and relatively priced, although beware the green tea is scorching hot, and chopstick usage is a must. If you love Pizza, you simply can NOT go past Lombardis in Soho area also, you will wait for 45-60mins although take a seat at the bar, the drinks are good and finally when your pizza arrives, you will not be sorry. We took some back to California with us, and would love to have it flown out if possible. Pizza just doesn't taste the same anymore, anywhere else. Shopping: Everyone raves about Soho for faux designer label sunglasses, bags etc, however we found this to be one big tourist trap with the same crap at every crammed side by side vendor store. Hundreds of people cramming to look at the same items, same prices, and people constantly hassling you, which we didn't enjoy. You will find that if you walk around the Times Square area, not the back, back streets, but just off the main drag that you will find the same items, with only a handful of tourists around and they are more incliined to meet your price as they know you can always head straight to Soho. This is where I bought a few bags and some sunglasses. In conclusion: If you want elegance, luxury, this really isn't worth the money, pay a little more, may not even have to and stay closer to Times Square or Central Park. It not that the hotel is BAD, just not probably what most would expect, when they say 'I'm staying at the Waldorf Astoria\".

On arrival we were dealt with at Reception by a very friendly and efficient chap who gave us a choice of rooms with different bed options. The bell hop delivered our case within minutes of us getting to our room. The Lobby and Reception are wonderful - it may not be the most modern style of hotel, but you don't go to the Waldorf for minimalism and chrome. The furnishings and fresh flower displays were wonderful. There was often a pianist playing in the lobby which added to the atmosphere. There were lots of beautifully dressed ladies and gents wandering around for a function which created a lovely, stylish and buzzy atmosphere in the lobby areas. The room was fine (on 17th Floor) but probably is due for a refurb. The room itself was a good size, the bathroom although a little small and dated was perfectly adequate (the old fashioned fittings somehow added to the olde world charm actually). A nice touch was the \"turn down\" service; you arrive back after an evening out to find your bed turned down, a lamp on and the radio playing relaxing soft jazz - it says you have to ask for this service but we didn't have to - like I say, a nice touch. On the downside the drinks are expensive but we expected this to be the case. Sir Harry's has a great atmosphere and the staff are very friendly, as are the Americans who are more than happy to talk and suggest places to go. Peacock Alley is perfect for a nightcap. The Bull and Bear bar is quite English in style. Oscars is quite informal but still relaxed and friendly. We had a wonderful three days in NYC (our first ever visit) and found the Waldorf to be the perfect base (great location) and would be happy to go back there. We do plan another visit to NYC, we would be more than happy to stay at the Waldorf again as we were very happy with it, but it is nice to try different places so will probably see what else is on offer. Our tips for first time visitors - Helicopter Flight is great, dinner cruise on World Yacht is a wonderful way of seeing the famous skyline at night. Breakfast in the food hall of Grand Central is good value and very tasty. Pre-theatre dinner at 21 Club is good value and has a great atmosphere - check out the toys! Be warned - don't take your expensive Dunhill (or similar) lighter with you to the US - they confiscate all lighters at security at JFK when you leave so you would lose your nice lighter for good!

I think they think if you are dressed casually you are less important and this became more apparent during my visit - My preassigned room was changed to a less favourable location (doesn't really bother me but it might bother you) - Room was deluxe king but for price and hotel reputation very dated. Room could do with complete makeover (beds, carpets, bathrooms etc) - No room safe although available at no charge in reception which is inconvenient - Mini bar already open when arrived and they attempted to charge $40 (approx)for items I didn't use although when I raised this issue they quickly removed it from the bill ! - Breakfast at Oscars (full buffett) was grand but had you been paying hotel prices not worth it. Ask for free buffett breakfast and upgrade at check in as they gave out alot of buffett breakfast vouchers as I was checking in and when I asked they also gave me vouchers for my stay which included taxes and tips!!. As I say worth it if free if not dont eat in otherwise. - Didn't eat in any main restaurants as prices I felt totally OTT.Have a look yourself when you get there. - Location of hotel - Excellent for 5th Ave, Maddison Ave etc and only about 15 min walk to broadway - At checkout we left our bags with concierge but had to go downstairs and collect our own bags and take them to the taxi when we went to collect them. Again I felt that casual dressed they felt that we didn't merit same level of service. - One good tip for you is that if you book in advance keep an eye out on the Hilton website for promotions and reduced rates right up to day before you go as prices often fall day before arrival so ring up and get the reduced price. Overall - Having travelled alot I feel the hotel is not good value for money, mixture of staff from excellent to less than polite. In regards to decor and as a place to relax not great at all.

It turns out \"accessible\" means that unless you are an ambidextrous mutant born with 4 arms, you aren't taking a shower, because the flexible shower head didn't have a mounting bracket. Third, when I'm paying $550 a night, I tend to assume certain amenities, like a comb and toothpaste in the room. It turns out that they just gave me the basics, soap and shampoo. Overall, I'd prefer to stay at a nicer hotel than this.

I went back to our room, stopped my husband from unpacking and off we trotted to reception - prepared to do battle. The guy behind the desk couldn't have been nicer. I didn't have to go into any detail, as soon as I said I wasn't happy he said he would move us, he offered us a choice of rooms and recommended that we take the one on the 13th floor which we did. The room was lovely and we settled in to enjoy a wonderful 4 days in New York. Apparently the hotel is being renovated and they have not reached the 11th floor yet so when they give you your keys, check if the room has been renovated, and if it hasn't don't even get in the lift. Apart from the hiccup with the room (which was easily sorted), we found everything else about the hotel perfect. The staff were really helpful and friendly and the hotel was really clean. Yes the hotel is old and no it's not modern so if you like shiny chrome and minimalism don't book the Waldorf, but if you want to be taken back to a golden age of class and gandeur then book this hotel.", "Date": "January 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cLet's go with...Historic.\u201d", "Author": "LOfallenVE", "ReviewID": "UR4355222", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Waldorf for 2 nights during our first trip to NYC. I was expecting it to be magical, much like many of the other reviewers here. However, if you take away the \"Waldorf Astoria\" sign out front, you're left with an old 3-star hotel with the corresponding 3-star customer service. My husband and I have stayed at many wonderful 4 and 5 star hotels- the only evidence of the Waldorf Astoria being in this class is it's reputation. We had the same complaints as previous reviewers. Our stay was complimentary, as we were using our Hilton Honors points. We are Gold members, which typically guarantees an upgraded room. I cannot imagine that the first room we received was upgraded, as it was extremely small with small window overlooking some mid-level Waldorf roof. The view was so appalling to me (garbage, heating units, other windows of the hotel), I called to request another room. I was polite, as was the receptionist, and we were moved to a large corner room with two large windows with great street views. However, the room still showed MANY signs of age: the carpet was dirty, the lighting was poor, the molding must have had 15 coats of paint on it and was peeling, the ceilings were sloped, the shower/tub was small and old, the sink area left no room for toiletries...I could go on and on. Our first room had showed the same signs of wear. I would not use the word \"luxurious\" to describe any aspect of this hotel. The lobby was nice, but not shockingly nice. The bar was extremely small. We ordered a bottle of champagne from room service and it took about 2 hours and 3 phone calls to make it to our room. Other reviewers may try to blame these inadequacies on the eye of the beholder, but if more than one reviewer complains of the same problem, you may want to give it a second thought. I believe that those who do not recognize the problems are still under the spell of the Waldorf mystique.

From the moment I arrived I was shocked and extremely disappointed. It took 46 minutes to check in, they had guests standing in one very long line that was snaking around a very crowded lobby, I can say that my bank at home does a better job of stream lining their customers then this hotel. It was only after standing in line that you read on a 8 1/2 x 11 laminated notice on a lobby table about 'express' check in...even the airlines and US Post Office have someone asking questions of people in long lines-so no one stands unnecessarily in a long line waiting for the simplest of requests. Now I finally make it up to my room where I am overwhelmed to see such a small room. Which was quite dirty and dingy, the beds were uncomfortable, linens felt worn and old, towels in the bathroom smelled funny and there was paint and plaster peeling from the back of the bathroom door. The tubs water spout was on but crooked so when an attempt was made to fix it you could actually turn it 360 degrees.Wow I could have my own waterfall ! Now if that wasn't bad enough we had requested a cot to arrive so upon returning to our room later in the evening it was there but no one had set it up it was standing straight up tied with what looked like a seat belt. Since the hour was now late. I headed down to guest services and voiced my concerns and was assured that my room would be changed but not until tomorrow and not until after 3 PM ..and so yes another 20 minute or so stand in a line so that I could receive my new room key .. now to add insult to injury before ever getting to our new room the toilet started to back up and become non functional in our old room I again headed down to guest services to voice my concerns where I was assured that the above matters would be addressed. So finally back to a new room which was really in all actuality was really no better as far as cleanliness to see the inch of thick dust in the air vents was GROSS and that was in the 'new' room! I even had to pick up a crumpled up piece of paper at the leg of the desk from the previous guest, and threw it in the trash can. Then there was the issue of the heating and how overwhelming hot and uncomfortable it was in the rooms, that to was brought to there attention but as you can imagine nothing again was done to correct this concern. We finally make it to the end of this stay and upon checking out, the car service we had used had some difficulty in locating the motor pick up area at the Waldorf Astoria so they requested that the pick up was at the main entrance at the hotel, when trying to retrieve our bags and get them to the location where we would be picked up the bell hop outside had that audacity to look us in the eye and yell and scream that we were using the wrong car service and we should of used his and that he wasn't going to get our bags so for 1 hour it was back and forth from concierge to concierge, to bell captain, to front desk he was yelling at not only myself but my other guests in my party, his behavior was embarrassing and humiliating and extremely condescending especially when he proceeded to act this way in front of a long line of other guests waiting in a long line for a taxi. I was embarrassed and humiliated as he was belittling me. Enclosing this trip was to be a celebration of a Birthday and of the Holiday season but due to our stay at the Waldorf Astoria I went home upset, angry and humiliated.

I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised and so glad that I did not cancel. We were greeted by the very friendly John (from County Mayo) when we arrived. John advised us to check our luggage in as the room wouldn't be ready for a while (it was 2.00pm). I declined saying that I had heard that it took an age for the luggage to appear in the room to which he was surprised. We joked about whether I would be able to check in when I went upstairs to reception. Happened to bump into him again in the lobby (with my room keys) as we were checked in by 2.15pm. I have to say that the receptionist was extremely friendly and welcoming. She also noted that it was my birthday and said that she would try and give us a bigger room which she did. No view unfortunately but as other reviewers have said - you are probably not in New York to sit in your room. The room was large with a large clean bathroom. There was sufficient space for clothes etc and there were facilities to make coffee although they were tucked away underneath the TV. Pamela did an excellent job of cleaning the room daily and as other reviewers have said the beds are soooo comfy with lovely bedding. We ate in Oscars every morning and thoroughly enjoyed the food. It was always extremely busy but there didn't seem to be too long a wait and overall it was a very pleasant experience. Although we never ate in the Bull and Bear the menu looked nice and not overly expensive considering the hotel we stayed in.

We had never been to NY before so relied on the internet for reviews. I had however, always had the name of the Waldorf=Astoria in the back of my mind. So we booked our stay of 5 nights at the W=A, even after reading the mixed reviews on this sight. Since returning I have continued to read the reviews, some of which leave me confused. I have read comments such as: \"needs some updating\"; \"tired decor\"; \"discourteous staff\"; \"no internet connections\"; \"small bathroom and bedroom\". To all the people who wrote such comments \"GET A LIFE\". Let me try to set the record straight. 1. Room size - we found the standard room we had more than adequate for us. My husband is 6'4\" and not once did he band his head on the ceiling. If we stood in the middle of the room with our arms stretched out they did not touch the walls of the room. YOU ONLY NEED TO SLEEP IN THE ROOM IS SIZE THAT IMPORTANT?????? 2.Decor and furnishings - The hotel may indeed require renovation in certain areas or floors. Don't think of it in the negative; imagine the history that the objects could be holding. If you want to stay somewhere new/modern or recently renovated, do your research and stay in a place that has no character or history. 3.Internet connection - if there is not one in your room so what. Is that a reason to dislike a hotel? I DON'T THINK SO. Again if you are a business man then do your homework before you book and stay where your MODERN/CHARACTERLESS hotel needs can be met. 4.Staff courtesy - my favourite saying applies here, \"You get what you give\". Perhaps the staff that appear discourteous have just been treated like 'servants' which they are not. They have hundreds of people a day making demands on them - how would you feel? Ask nicely, be patient etc. If travelling with young children that may need special equipment (I have in the past, so i do know) take it with you/enquire first/make prior arrangements. Its not the fault of the hotel or staff if you have not made every prior attempt before your visit. Our room service was always prompt and what we asked for. We had our 'wedding breakfast' meal in the 'Captains Corner' of the Bull&Bear within the W=A.The staff members were attentive to us and all our guests. The food was delicious and the prices were of a standard price for the type of hotel we were in. The service in all the restaurants and bars we tried (Peacock Alley, Sir Harrys, Oscars, Cocktail Terrace and the Bull and Bear) was adequate enough. On the whole our stay was wonderful and there a few small things I would have preferred done slightly differently, nothing that tainted our stay.

We arrived at approx 11am and were told we wouldn\u2019t be able to check into our rooms until 3pm so therefore had to trudge around with our hand luggage without being able to get changed or freshen up after a 7hour flight.

After reading some reviews on Tripadvisor I was prepared for a 'less then modern' hotel - but the Waldorf is in DESPERATE need of a refurb - which they are now in the process of - however if you happen to get stuck on a floor where some refurb is taking place you may have trouble opening the door to your room as there is such a wind force blowing where some rooms have been gutted to the extent of having no windows.

In the morning, we forgot to bolt the door and were surprised by cleaning crew who just opened the door without knocking... even though we had asked for extended check-out and put a \"Do-Not-Disturb\" sign. After bolting the door, we still received knocks, even though the door says bolting the door notifies the cleaning service that the room is not to be disturbed. Someone did call later in the morning to apologize and see if there was anything else that could be done. Breakfast at Oscars was delicious. The manager even changed the date on one of our complimentary breakfasts, since we already had one. All in all, we'd definitely recommend going elsewhere.

Our room was spacious with a superb view of the Crysler building, it wasn't very modern but you'd expect that for such an old hotel. The price for room service was unreal, we paid $70 for 2 sandwiches & $8 for a coke from the mini-bar!! As we were not business travellers,we weren't wearing suits, I found the staff treated us differently. For example, I was waiting to speak to one staff member to book a helicopter ride over New York. He was so ignorant & made me wait over 15 minutes, in the end I just left without booking the trip. On a positive note, we did leave some photographs behind, when we contacted the hotel upon our return to Ireland they posted the photos back to us, for which we were very greatful. Also the location for the hotel is good, in a nice & safe area. In summary the hotel is a GRAND OLD HOTEL, however, we simply did not find it worth the money.

They took my jacket and told me to go buy a new one - \"no problem, we'll take care of it\". Since I only had that one jacket with me, I bought a new one the next day and then checked out soon thereafter. Well, that was the last I heard from my sports jacket, the hotel staff, or the security people there. After much effort to get the hotel to resolve this, I called the police to ask what to do. The NYPD classified this as a grand larceny. I was told that this is apparently a common problem with \"hotel security\" in NYC. But I never expected this from the Waldorf Astoria Hotel! I was told I needed to pursue a civil action to get any recourse which should be either reimbursement for the cost of my jacket or simply my jacket returned to me. The Head of Security there had the nerve to tell the NYPD that they would pay me something but then later he never answered my calls.

Ask if you can have a corner room, these are larger and have several windows For breakfast go out of the Lexington ave entrance, turn left and go 2 blocks to a diner or 3 blocks to Au Bon Pain bakery.

We were surprised that on arrival we had to go up from the luggage bay, rather than being dropped of (by one of the hotel limos) at the main Park Avenue entrance. The lobby is undeniably spectacular, but the wait for check-in was excessive. Our room wasn't ready, despite our travel agent requesting early check-in for us. Eventually, we were given the key to a room, and directed towards the elevators. As someone else commented, we also got static electricity shock all the time - from elevator buttons, door handles, anything going! When we got to the room, I was surprised at the size of it - it seemed small, especially given the grand and luxurious 'facade' of the hotel. Still, the bedroom was nicely decorated, and the bed was comfortable. The view left a lot to be desired - looking out towards tower blocks (I suppose kind of unavoidable in NYC) with a roof with A/c units on it about 4 storeys below. This didn't cause us any problems with noise since it was so cold outside we didn't open the windows. The bathroom was badly in need of renovation - and was exceptionally small, even for a city hotel. The sink area and mirror in particular needed replaced. The mini bar was very expensive, and the internet facility, at $10 a day through the television was not worth the money - you couldn't get to certain sites because of the difficulty of using a cursor. We dined in The Bull & Bear on our first night, and were extremely disappointed. Drinks ordered after our starters never arrived, and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s main course was brought to the table incorrectly cooked (a steak, very well done) was brought cooked medium-rare, despite my fianc\u00e9 saying when he ordered that it had to be absolutely cooked through. The steak was brought back again, still undercooked, and again finally cooked well enough. By this time, however, I had finished my main course as much as I could - although it was bland and tasteless chicken, grilled and chewy. Therefore, we hadn't eaten together on our first night in NYC. The maitre d' also seemed to be unable to ask the chef to cook a portion of plain mashed potatoes, saying the chef only had garlic mash available. If a hotel of the reputation and standard of the Waldorf=Astoria cannot produce a portion on plain, non-garlic mashed potatoes then the kitchen is severely lacking. The side of vegetables my fianc\u00e9 ordered also came 5 minutes after the steak was finally delivered thoroughly enough cooked. By this point, we were so tired, frustrated and disappointed in the restaurant which is so highly praised, thus why we decided to dine there, that we left, my fianc\u00e9 having not eaten his main course, and me not having much of the main course. We informed the maitre d', who had been off-hand and unhelpful, that we were leaving and did not expect to see the attempt at a meal on our bill, he suddenly became very apologetic, especially, we suspect, as we had told him so in front of a group of 6 other customers. He pleaded with us to come back the next night, although we already had plans, and we unable to. He said a breakdown in communication was to blame, and that plain mash could certainly be made, despite his earlier claim that because it was a Saturday night, the kitchen was busy and couldn't. Instead we were offered a complimentary room service breakfast, which we took full advantage of on February 14th. We didn't dine in the hotel on any other occasion as a result of this bad experience - a good suggestion for breakfast is a little deli with a maroon awning opposite St Patrick's cathedral, which is about 2 blocks up from the Waldorf. The concierge was helpful, and found us a reservation at a very nice Italian restaurant off Broadway for dinner before we went to see the Producers. However, when we asked how long we should allow for dinner to get to the theatre in time to collect our tickets, the concierge got the time of the show wrong by 1/2 hour, and we had to run to get to the show. This hotel is very impressive in the public areas, but considering the room rates, I would say it is need of renovation in a number of areas (the rooms, and bathrooms in particular). Check-out took quite some time as there were long queues in the lobby. It then took us almost an hour to get a car or cab to the airport, despite the bellboy telling us we'd be able to get a cab within 5 minutes. We eventually had to commandeer one of the hotel's cars to take us, for twice the cost of a cab - if we'd waited much longer we'd have missed our flight. As I said, a nice hotel, faded grandeur, with some rooms badly positioned and laid out. The staff were also questionable at times - some were very pleasant, yet others seemed to look down at guests. It was nice to stay here for the experience, but there are so many other hotels in NYC that I think I'd try more of them before rushing back to the Waldorf.", "Date": "August 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Royal Oak, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cWe loved the Waldorf!\u201d", "Author": "FionaBell", "ReviewID": "UR3794909", "Content": "I read the mixed reviews and started to get nervous about our stay.

Requested a room with 2 beds, away from the elevators, stairs, and ice machines. I also requested a corner room since I read on various message boards that corner rooms were slightly larger than others. I called the hotel to reconfirm my requests two days prior to arrival. I arrived at 10:00 pm via a limo/sedan service. We pulled up to the front entrance on Park Avenue but the doorman told us we had to go around the corner to the other entrance to drop off our luggage. The bellman took our luggage, gave us a ticket and told us to check in at the front desk and that they would deliver our luggage to our room. There was a short wait at the check-in desk but it went fairly quickly. The hotel ran out of the corner room with two beds that I had previously requested but did give me a corner room on the 15th floor with one bed. I asked the clerk if it would be possible to change rooms the following day and she said yes and that I should come back after 3:30 pm to check for availability. We proceeded to go up to the room until my son mentioned that he was really thirsty. The bellman walked us to the gift shop where we purchased our drinks. He said he would meet us up in our room with our luggage. When we arrived in our room, the bellman showed up shortly after that. After he dropped off our luggage, he took the liberty to go down the hall to fill our ice bucket for our drinks. Now, that's something I've never experienced before at another hotel! All was smooth sailing until I noticed and the bellman noticed that the coffee maker in our room was dirty (still had coffee in it) along with a half full dirty coffee cup. The bellman said he would report it to the front desk for me. About half an hour after the bellman left, no one had come to change out the dirty coffee pot or cup so I called the front desk myself. It took two phone calls that night and one phone call in the morning before I received my new coffee pot and new coffee cup. That, I found was unacceptable. Our room was good sized and seemed clean except for the coffee pot incident. It had a fairly large closet, one really comfortable bed with luxurious sheets, pillows and blankets, a desk with a chair and a fax machine. The room was big enough for me to use the air mattress that I had brought along (just in case we didn't get a room with two beds). The bathroom was also a good size. Full tub with shower, large sink, and plenty of floor space to move around. The following day we checked in at the front desk around 8:30 pm after our NY tour to request for the change of room with two beds. The clerk stated that they had held 4 corner rooms for us with two beds but when they went to collect our luggage to move into the new room, the luggage\u2019s were not packed, therefore, they had given up our rooms to other guests. I told her that the clerk the night before did not mention that I had to pack my bags. I asked her if the other rooms with two beds were indeed smaller than the corner rooms and she said yes, they were a lot smaller. The clerk then excused herself and went and spoke with a manager. The manager came back and started checking something on the clerk's computer screen. While he was doing that, I told him in a kidding way that I wouldn't mind if he upgraded us to a suite. He replied and said he may be able to do something for me. The clerk came back and said that I got upgraded to a mini suite with two beds, a sitting room, and basically, a much larger and better room than the corner room I had originally requested. We packed up our old room and checked into our new 11th floor room. Upon arriving to the front door, I noticed we were right next to the ice machine. My first thought was, \u201coh no\u201d, that's why this room was available but once we got into the room, we checked out the noise level from the ice machine from inside the room and it was tolerable since the only place where you could really hear the ice machine was in the toilet area. The entrance to the mini suite leads you into a roomy foyer. From there, you enter the main part of the room with two double beds, an armoire with a TV, a desk and the fax machine. To the left of the desk is a door that leads to a sitting room which had a reading lamp and single sofa, and a vanity area. From there, you walk through french swing doors that lead you to the marbled floor bathroom. The bathroom was large enough to fit two people comfortably. Bathroom amenities included Neutrogena shampoo, conditioner, lotions, soaps, and mouthwash. There was a separate air conditioning/heating system for the main room and one for the sitting room. The two closets were in the sitting room. We ended up using the air mattress in the sitting room for my older son since he wanted the privacy and we each ended up getting our own separate beds which was nice since it\u2019s not too comfortable sharing a double size bed. The beds were really comfortable. The sheets and comforter were also really nice. I found the towels to be on the skimpy side considering the sheets and comforters were such high quality. There are at least 4 different entrances/exits to the hotel. The lobby on Park Avenue is the grandest. The lobby was always busy during the day and evening hours. A lot of people just relaxing on the sofas. I used the hotel\u2019s safe deposit box everyday which was free of charge. I did not order room service as the prices were outrageous. I did not eat in any of the restaurants in the hotel either. The hotel is ideally situated to 5th Avenue and Madison Avenue shopping, Times Square, Grand Central Station and subway and bus lines. All was within walking distance. The #6 train stops half a block away from the hotel and the bus stop is also about half a block away. We purchased the 7-day Metrocard which was the best value for traveling around Manhattan for the 10 days we were there. We didn\u2019t take the taxi at all since the subway and buses were so convenient and there were so many of them that the wait was really short. I preferred taking the buses since you could see the sites as you passed instead of being in the hot subway platforms and underground on the subway. For longer trips from one point to another, the subway is the way to go since it gets you there much faster. My MTA subway and bus map along with a laminated street map that I purchased online were invaluable. I didn\u2019t get lost once during our stay! Check out was smooth and painless. It took less than a minute at the front desk. The ride to the airport on the other hand was a different story but I\u2019ll save that for another message board. After I booked the Waldorf=Astoria I started reading the message boards and then started to worry that I had booked the wrong hotel since a lot of the posts were negative. To my relief, my stay was a splendid one except for the coffee pot incident but everything else about this hotel was fine. The decor was fine, the staff was friendly, the plumbing and air conditioning were fine. The grandeur and the history of the hotel is something special in itself.

When my husband surprised me with Broadway tickets for our anniversary, it seemed the perfect opportunity for our own \u201cweekend at the Waldorf.\u201d LOCATION Location....location...location....the Waldorf-Astoria is located on Park Avenue, between 49th and 50th streets. This location is very accessible by public transportation (Grand Central Terminal is just about 4-5 blocks down) and very handy to shopping, tourist attractions, theater district, etc. ARRIVAL I booked a Concierge Suite through the hotel website for $335/night. When we arrived at the Waldorf, I couldn\u2019t stop staring at the beautiful Park Avenue lobby and the gorgeous \u201cWheel of Life\u201d floor mosaic. We then went from that lobby into the wood-paneled Main Lobby. The centerpiece of this lobby was the very ornate historic clock. The contrast between the two lobbies was very interesting, with the Park Ave Lobby being very feminine and pastel, and the Main Lobby being very dark and masculine. We made our way over to the reception desk where the courteous reception clerk checked us in immediately. It was a few minutes after 2pm and there was no line. I had casually mentioned that it was our anniversary in the comments section of the online reservation form, and to our delighted surprise, the clerk informed us that he was upgrading us to a luxury suite in the Waldorf Towers! He then directed us to the private elevator for Towers gusts. It took me a moment to realize that you had to insert your room key into a reader for the elevator to move. ACCOMMODATIONS After a rapid ascent, my husband and I arrived on the 29th floor and quickly found our room number, 29M. The hallway was lovely, decorated in soft pastel shades and gilt chandeliers. We opened the door and I was amazed. Immediately I realized that this was no ordinary hotel suite. We entered into a marble-floored foyer and walked straight through to a sumptuous living room. I loved the serene color scheme of light blues and aqua. One end of the room held a gracious seating area with built-in bookcases. Several large windows, dressed with exquisite valences and drapes, offered views of Park Avenue. A large, gilt-edged mirror over a marble fireplace dominated the opposite end of the room. A second seating area contained three winged chairs, sofa and coffee table. A large antique desk held leather portfolios that contained embossed stationary, post cards, room service menus and other info. A matching stand held a combined printer/fax machine. The overall d\u00e9cor of the room gave the feel of being in an English country house. We walked back to the foyer and turned left into a small corridor which contained a large closet and a gorgeous green-marbled topped wet-bar that held a small refrigerator. My only complaint was that the mini-bar case took up most of the space inside, but we found enough room to house our own bottles of water, champagne, etc. From the corridor, we entered a nice-sized bedroom where the light aqua color scheme was accentuated by darker green and rust orange in the furniture and bedspread. The king-sized bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning system worked well enough that we were able to enjoy the wonderful Frette linen bedsheets and duvet. A dressing room/boudoir was next, with a dressing table and three large size floor-to ceiling mirrored closets that were large enough to hold full-length ballgowns. Inside were two luxurious Frette bathrobes that were heavenly to lounge about in. From the boudoir, we stepped into a large marble bathroom containing a deep, soaking tub, a separate shower and a large sink/vanity. The crowning touch was a lovely silver tray bearing posh Penhaligon English bath products and shampoo. The water temperature and pressure were excellent, both in the shower and the tub, and the fluffy towels provided made it a joy to dry off. A few minutes after we explored the suite, the doorbell rang and my husband opened it to find one of the hotel staff bearing a tray of petit-fours and strawberries, compliments of the hotel. I was very touched by the solicitous attention we were receiving. The goodies were absolutely delicious and I later found out (when we returned home and I looked up the price) that the level of suite to which we had been upgraded normally went from $739 to over a grand (depending on the time of year), per night. DINING The Waldorf offers quite a few options for dining. We were disappointed to learn at the time of check-in that the 4-star French restaurant, Peacock Alley was closed until November for renovations. We did enjoy a wonderful dinner and excellent cocktails at the Bull & Bear. Entree prices were in the $30-40 range, but we thoroughly enjoyed the \u201cAngus Prime\u201d steak and felt it deserved the hype. Other restaurants at the Waldorf currently include Oscars, the casual brasserie and Inagiku, a Japanese restaurant. We also took advantage of the Executive Lounge, which served continental breakfast and evening hors d\u2019oeurves. The Lounge was pleasant and some of the food choices were very tasty such as the chicken with mango and black bean salsa. Soft drinks, coffee and tea were complimentary, but alas, alcoholic drinks are not complimentary. The Lounge was very graciously and comfortably furnished, but was a little on the small side and could get a bit crowded. On Sunday, we decided to be totally decadent and ordered breakfast through Room Service. This was very pricey, but it was a fabulous splurge. Our breakfast included a scrumptious spinach and tomato frittata, eggs & sausage, bakery basket of croissant and danish and freshly squeezed orange juice. This all arrived on a rolling cart, elegantly set with linen tablecloth and napkins, china, crystal glassware and the crowning luxury of a fragrant rose in a bud vase. Best of all, the food quickly arrived, piping hot and fresh. SERVICE Having read some of the reviews on this board, we were very pleased with the high level of service we received. I can honestly say that I felt the hotel lived up to the reputation of being the hotelier for presidents, kings, queens, ambassadors, etc, that it touts on its website. Whenever we encountered a staff member, even in the hallway, they wished us a pleasant good morning/evening. The housekeeper was cheerful and room service was very prompt and courteous. All in all, my husband and I have to give the Waldorf Astoria top marks for its overall service and value. One small drawback was the high charge for parking at $45.00 a day. We would have preferred to drive into the city, but we felt that this cost was excessive, especially given that we were guests at the hotel. Apart from that point, however, we were extremely pleased with our stay.", "Date": "July 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Concord, NC", "Title": "\u201cBeauty only skin deep\u201d", "Author": "NC_Hiker", "ReviewID": "UR3681567", "Content": "We stayed at the Waldorf (room 1424) during a meeting held there. Our airport car dropped us off at the motor entrance, sort of a \"tunnel\" in the middle of the hotel on the ground floor. There was luggage everywhere chained to racks. There was no staff to assist us with our luggage so we followed the signs to the lobby. The lobby and all the public areas are simply wonderful. The workmanship of craftsmen from times past really makes an impression. And impressed we were - until we arrived at our room. The standard rooms are small and have ancient heating / a/c units which are difficult to set to get a comfortable temperature. While the furnishings seemed to be in good shape, the basic room was not. Peeling paint and damaged woodwork were very noticeable. The bathroom was in poor shape. The tub had been refinished at some time in the past and the \"new\" coating was now peeling off in large sheets to expose the original surface. The fiberglass sink had also been painted over and black cracks were appearing for several inches in all directions around the drain. It was not at all what I expected of the Hilton \"flagship\". We had dinner at Oscars - two appetizers, a sandwich and a fish dish. The bill was just over $60 which seemed a bit much for what we had. The next night we ate at the Bull and Bear where we both had filets. I can't recommend the restaurants given the fact there is much better food available outside the hotel. On checkout I gave the bellman our luggage to store for 2 hours while we did checked out the sights. When we returned and went to the luggage storage area we found luggage stacked everywhere outside and down the hallway. They had no idea where our luggage was but after searching the hallway we found 3 of the 4 bags - unsecured. The fourth bag was harder to find - they gave up looking but we finally located it under another bag some distance away. I recommend if you want to see the Waldorf, stay somewhere else and stop by the Waldorf to tour the public areas - that way you might avoid a poorly maintained room like ours.", "Date": "July 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cbeautiful hotel,but very hot\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3675405", "Content": "my husband and i took our 2 nephews to new york for 4 nights,i bid for my hotel and was given the waldorf astoria.i was very pleased that we would be staying there since i had heard so much about it.the hotel is very beautiful,very easy check-in.our room was very nice,but,not comfortable.first of all,there are only double beds,very hard to adapt to when most hotels of this caliber now have queen beds.the room was very hot when we entered so i pulled the shades and turned the ac on high.we left and went to dinner,came back about 3 hours later and the room was still hot.i called maintance,he arrived quickly and said the ac was working properly and that he would ask the manager to call us.the manager called and said the \"problem\"would be taken care of the next day.i assumed maybe that we would be moved to another room but no one ever contacted us again during our stay.we ended up having to remove all bed covering except for 1 sheet and still could not sleep comfortably.if you are looking for a beautiful hotel only you should stay here but if you like to sleep in a comfortable room please look elsewhere", "Date": "July 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cImpeccable in all Aspects\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3615176", "Content": "INTRODUCTION: I will only speak words of unmistakeable praise for the incomparable Waldorf=Astoria. Situated in a prominent and convenient New York City location, it is an expansive building that rises to forty-two stories when the opulent Waldorf Towers are included. No aspect of my stay could be improved, except for minor details that are not worth remembering. I will outline each experience and why it was enjoyed. PRIOR TO ARRIVAL Since my flight out of Canada was delayed until the next morning due to electrical storms above LaGuardia airport, the Waldorf=Astoria graciously agreed to hold our extensive suite for check-in the next morning. ARRIVAL AND CHECK IN Driven in by my our limousine driver from the LaGuardia Airport to the somewhat narrow motor entrance, we were promptly greeted courteously by Waldorf=Astoria staff who immediately took our luggage and stored it until we had checked in. We walked up to the reception area, what I would dub the second lobby, where elaborate armchairs and sofas await weary travelers. A historical clock graces the centre of the lobby and chimes hourly. One knows that they are already immersed in this hotel's spectacular history. Check-in is efficient and personable, and luggage is carried to the room separately but arrives promptly. ROOM I would have to consider the two-bedroom and two-bathroom suite at the Waldorf=Astoria the most sumptuous in which I have ever stayed. Upon opening the double door with the stainless steel handle, we were greeted with a feast for the eyes: a beautiful checked floor in the foyer that led to other beautifully decorated and furnished rooms. i. FOYER The foyer, as mentioned, included a tasteful chessboard style floor. A bench sat against the wall; a table against the other. At the right of the entrance, there was a bar: complete with glasses, a sink, and two refrigerators. The refrigerator was useful for freezing water, as the weather in New York City was very hot over the duration of the stay. ii. MASTER BEDROOM The master bedroom, with striped white and yellow wallpaper, included a four poster bed as well as much storage space. The storage space included a walk in closet with a bolted safe, and two dressers. There was also a large television for the use of guests. iii. DRESSING ROOM With even more closet space, a large mirror, and a make-up table, this room was very useful for us. It also had a very relaxing and comfortable chair beside a telephone table which was useful for placing calls. iv. MASTER BATH The master bathroom was equally as, if not more, exceptional that all of the other rooms. The same chessboard floor as in the foyer was a prominent feature, as well as a separate toilet room with a telephone and two sinks. There was also a bath and separate shower, which had a wide range of temperatures for water. Lighting is very divided in the bathroom which is useful for environmental purposes. v. SECOND BEDROOM The second bedroom, which was an attachment to the Suite, was smaller but equally embellished. It held a Queen sized bed and ample closet space. It led to a second bathroom, which was simple but large enough in which to function. vi. LIVING ROOM I would have liked to spend my entire stay in this room, admiring the tasteful furniture and elaborate finishings. There was a small collection of books that would have been a pleasure to peruse. For business travelers in New York City, there was a desk with personal facsimile machine and lovely Waldorf=Astoria stationery and postcards that I was pleased to use. It was also a fine place to eat breakfast for in-room dining. GENERAL STAFF ATTITUDES DURING STAY These were always positive. We were always greeted by maids, bellmen, and chefs alike in a courteous manner. The traffic director at the front of the hotel did all in his power to flag down taxis for Waldorf=Astoria guests, which was a recognisably difficult task. A staff member even welcomed us into the Grand Ballroom, which was being prepared for a special function, to see it. This was a true portrayal of the standard of service under which this grand hotel operates. PROXIMITY TO ATTRACTIONS Located at the corner of Park Avenue and 50th Street, the location cannot be beaten. While it is away from the bustle and even danger of Wall Street and Ground Zero, it is in great propinquity to attractions such as the Rockefeller Center. It is also only a block away from St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church and others such as St. Thomas's. It is only a short walk to dining (if one is not enjoying the dining that the hotel has to offer) and the theatre district. (Taking a taxi to the theatre is a waste of time due to the wait at that time of day.) The hotel is also quite near to famous stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Pink, but I recommend a taxi to major department stores such as Macy*s or Bloomingdale's. BUSINESS CENTER This is the only place where I find fault in the Waldorf=Astoria, for a very small reason. I had to receive a facsimile from my office during the stay, and the fee for receiving the fairly thick facsimile was over $50. While I found our room to be somewhat of a bargain, I was flabbergasted at this price. However, the Business Center conveniently took my postcards and letters to put in the US Mail. DINING There are three restaurants in the hotel of diverse natures: the casual Oscar's, the fine dining steakhouse The Bull and Bear, and Inagiku, which markets its fine Japanese cuisine. The hotel also boasts a plethora of fine bars and lounges. Personally, I only ate one dinner and two breakfasts at Oscar's, and left the hotel premises for other enjoyable meals (such as at District or San Pietro - all my sincere recommendations). All meals, though not inexpensive, were thoroughly enjoyable. We also enjoyed cocktails in the hotel's lobby while enjoying the live pianist who plays exceptionally and watching the comings and goings of guests. It is certainly a very upbeat lobby. CHECK-OUT AND DEPARTURE With a commitment that lasted until 1245 on Sunday afternoon, we would not be able to meet the standard check out time of 1200. Therefore, Guest Services kindly extended our stay to 130 PM free of charge. When we finally did check out, it was done in a very professional yet friendly manner. We were advised to, because we enjoyed the suite so much, return and request the same room. We certainly will. Since our flight was not until the evening, the hotel stored our baggage for the balance of the afternoon. OTHER REMARKS i. Elevators Elevators at the Waldorf=Astoria are rather small and rarely private. Six elevators with usually only five working tends not be enough, but there are never waits that are too extensive. ii. History The hotel was first opened in 1893 by the wealthy William Waldorf Astor, at the site of his former grand residence at the corner of Fifth Avenue at 33rd Street. The = symbol in the Waldorf=Astoria was born when the Astoria Hotel was built and linked with a corridor. Both buildings were razed in 1929 for the Empire State Building, and the next Waldorf=Astoria was erected in 1930 and 1931. Further information regarding history can be found on the hotel's website, (---). In conclusion, the Waldorf=Astoria has a refined group of staff members everywhere to the business center to the maids, is in a pristine location, and boasts great history and d\u00e9cor. I feel obliged to recommend this exceptional property to anyone who enjoys a feel of history and opulence where they stay.", "Date": "June 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3612234", "Content": "This was my first stay in NYC and I was told that I must stay at the Waldorf Astoria. It was the New Year's Eve weekend and I expected the hotel staff to be busy. The only complaint I had at first arrival was the check in. I requested early check in and arrived around 2pm as expected. After waiting in a line for 30 minites, waiting for one of 8 desk receptions to check me in, I was told that my room was not ready and to return in an hour. I decided to look around the area for the hour and then returned to the hotel. Once I returned, I was told to wait an additional hour due to the maid service not being done cleaning the room. Again, I went out for a walk to admire the area. This check in process happened one more time and by 6:30pm I was finally able to go to my room. Needless to say, I was not too happy after a long trip to NY having to wait for nearly 5 hours outside looking for entertainment to occupy my time. The lobby was very nice and large. Elevators were nicely decorated. Hallways were clean and large to move around. Entrance to my suite was impressive with the doorbell and old style door handles. The room was very large with plenty of room, over 450 sqf.. The living room had nice furniture with bar area etc. Bedroom was spacious with beautiful and comfortable bed. Bathroom was very nice and clean. One complaint about bathroom was that the toilet was running the entire stay at the hotel but I did not make the complaint to the front desk to ask that it be fixed, so dont judge that. Noise level from the street was low but the fans from the rooftop was somewhat annoying with the windows open. Not a big deal. Food prices for room service was way too expensive, even for this style hotel. The average for one person to have a nice breakfast in the room is between $20 - $35. I suggest leaving the room before 9am and going outside to one of many little deli's. They serve hot and cold breakfasts for less than $5 a person. That includes, two eggs, bacon, toast, and coffee or juice. I did not eat lunch or dinner at the hotel and chose to eat at the deli's enjoyng tastes that you can only get in NYC. The close attractions are nice. The Waldorf Astoria is close to Central Park and Times Square. If you want to watch the ball drop, which I did with my Fiance, I suggest leaving very early around 3 or 4pm. The streets close off quickly.

Service: Some 'grand' hotels have staff who fawn over you, which I can't stand; or they go to the other extreme and treat guests with cold contempt. The W=A staff got it just right. Now the negatives. The room was clean, and comfortable, but small and dowdy. Imagine staying at Grandma's house; it's OK, if a bit chintzy, but there's a lingering sense of damp mustiness. Oh and the bathroom badly needs remodeling. My room had the vanity unit cupboard doors sealed against damp with masking tape, and rust rings around the faucets. Strange people in the bull and bear: there were two high-class ladies, um, 'advertising their trade' in the bull and bear. Nothing overtly raunchy going on, of course -- these were upscale pros-- but I've been on enough business trips to know it when I see it.", "Date": "May 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cSophisticated and Elegant\u201d", "Author": "Tor0110", "ReviewID": "UR3418799", "Content": "My husband and I have just returned from our first visit to New York having stayed at the Waldorf Astoria from 16 - 23 April.

We were spoiled: We had a mini suite with two double beds with an amazing view right over Park avenue. Everything was gold and red. Very high ceilings with elegant moldings all around. A very hidden safety deposit box, large tv, armoire. We had french doors into a parlor where we both had our own closets and robes. Also coffee, mini bar, refrigerator, vanity. The bathroom was very spacious and also had those high ceilings. Nice deep bath tub, marble floors, plenty of extra gifts, nice big mirror over counter/sink... We were very satisfied. The bellmen, maids, and all other employees were very kind and helpful if we needed anything. The spa was amazing, as was the hair salon. The whole scene was gorgeous. We got facials and massages. They were pricey, but what can you expect? I thought it was worth it. The first problem was one of the concierges that was always there. My mom and I asked about what is around in the nightlife. He gave us about three recomendations, all of which were bad and he didn't understand what we were asking. So don't even bother with him, not very smart. (He also can't spell!) The second problem was that we scheduled afternoon tea. And double checked it an hour in advance. When we got there, there were cameras because we found out they were filming something or doing an interview. After asking many people we found out that there would be no afternoon tea. Even though we had already called and no one said it had been cancelled. We just went to the Plaza instead. Which was very nice (but that's for another review) As for the cleanliness... Me and my mom are fanatics about that. As for the other reviews I wouldn't accuse them of lying, maybe just exagerating, or they could have just had bad rooms. But in our experince everything was very clean. The bathrooms were spotless and the curtains and beds looked vintage (which is the whole hotel theme.

I took a lot of pictures of the suite that I stayed in in to submit to tripadvisor.com. First of all, I stayed in a \"Landmark Luxury Suite\". I have stayed at the Waldorf in the past and would suggest that you upgrade if you can, even to something larger than the standard. I will also primarily discuss this accommodation as a suite as it was relevant to my stay there, so if you want to read about this suite and possibly book it, stay with me on this. The hotel: I have stayed at The Plaza (see my review there) and The Waldorf in the past. This hotel is definitely far superior to the Plaza! Check-in was nice and quick. They advised me that I had VIP status but that really meant NOTHING! Check out was even better as you just call 69 from your extension and they instantly check you out and all you do is just leave your keys in the room. The lobby is opulent and grand, truly. The Waldorf is NYC's grand-dame and properly so. The suite: Guys, this suite will knock the socks off any girl! All my girlfriend kept saying was \"Oh my God, honey\". Incredible, especially for NYC. The suite had a HUGE living room and a nice king bedroom. All the cielings are high. It was tastefully furnished and as you can see from the pictures above (from my cell phone poor quality's cam) this suite is sweet! While it is worth the extra, the ONLY down-side is that there was no private dining area (but you could use the desk with two chairs in the living room). The ONLY other down-side: The televisions should be plasma and that would make this suite perfect! The layout: You enter into a beautiful and huge marble foyer with double door entry and small chandelier. On the right you have an entrance to a huge living room with a sofa, two plush chairs, an armoire, two end tables and a faux fireplace with two ottomans in fromt of it. The decor is tasteful. To the far left of the foyer: there is an entry to a full small kitchen closed with a door. This has a full fridge, toaster, cabinets, champagne/wine glasses, a dishwasher, toaster-oven, and a microwave. It was great to stop and bring back water, breakfast stuff and goodies without the inflated price of the mini bar charges! To the left of the foyer: The bedroom. The bedroom was large but simple. It had a nice king-sized bed, 2 chairs with a table between them, an armoir, two night stands, an ottoman and a chest with drawers. PRIVACY: After crossing the bedroom: The cool thing about this suite is the bedroom's privacy! The bedroom shares a wall with the dressing room to the south and the other wall is the living room to the north. That means that you have no neighbors at all while you sleep. The dressing room is great! This is a perfect suite for a long stay. The dressing room is a large bedroom-sized room that has 6 closets and storage on top for large luggage pieces. There is also a large electronic safe for valuables. It is equiped with a desk and chair, floor to cieling mirrors and a window to the outside and a chandelier. The bathroom: After crossing the dressing room, the bathroom is next. This was one of the coolest part of this suite. The bathroom was about 15 ft. by 15 ft. It had one sink with plenty of space on top (I am not sure why they did not make it a double sink). There is a seperate shower and a huge tub (without jets). The shower is equipped with 3 jets. There is a small peninsula where the toilet is enclosed but the toilet has no private door. Again, little things that are irrelevant but can perfect this suite. The bathroom also has a small chandelier. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by the Waldorf and actually the value that you can get on this type of regal accommodation! The view: As you can see it is nice. You get the north view of the stretch of Park Avenue. If you look west, you can see 50th Street and a glimpse of St. Patrick's Cathedral that is only a block away. You are extremely close to all Midtown Manhattan attractions. Times Square, Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Central Park, Grand Central and theaters are all within a 15 minute walk or less.

The Waldorf, although a nice hotel and amazing that it was constructed in the late 1800's is not a boutique hotel. If you want a truly unique experience I would suggest staying at its sister hotel...the Waldorf Towers. I do think the website for the Waldorf...if you have arrived there through the Hilton website is very misleading. Nowhere within the site does it mention that the Towers are a hotel within a hotel and occupy the 28 through 42 floors of the Waldorf Astoria. Hotel guest can easily book a suite...but to only realize at time of check-in that your room will not be higher than the 27th floor. To be fair, this little fact is mentioned...only after you manage to look at the Towers website, but it is not clear on the Waldorf site...in addition, the pictures shown on the Waldorf site are their best suites on the 27th floor facing Park Ave. To conclude, be ware as one guest mentioned...you pay for what you get. During the Winter months a one night stay at the Waldorf is surprisingly low rate of 300 per night, while the Towers smallest room (800sq ft) will set you back 800 per night....to compare...a Waldorf luxury suite is only 400 per night while the Towers Empire Room is 5000 per night.", "Date": "March 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beds, UK", "Title": "\u201cOld school hotel - a must stay!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3242580", "Content": "Having read the reviews on this site before we travelled I was extremely concerned about staying at the hotel and tried very hard to change my booking to another hotel.

I think the thing to remember is that this is an old school hotel, it was built in the 1930's (ish) and is not a modern hotel. However it is a beautiful art deco building and a New York classic- so you won't find minamalist furniture and uber cool surrondings but you will find a true art deco experience. The hotel is huge which is why there are so many business travellers there but they didn't bother us at all. The staff were friendly and polite to us at all times. The lobby and entrance areas are a must see - they don't make hotels like this anymore and much nicer than the Plaza! Our room was a little on the small side but what do you need a huge room for anyway?? We had the most comfy King size bed I've ever stayed in with beautiful decor throughout (again not at all minimalist but tasteful chinz), a big wardrobe (enough for a week's worth of clothes) and a small ish bathroom. All were clean and well kept. One point worth noting is that New York is not a quiet city!!!!! Our room was on the Lexington Ave side of the hotel and was noisy but you get used to it and I think that you would suffer the same problem in any NYC hotel - so light sleepers be warned. We ate breakfast at Oscars one morning which was fine - the bill came to around $60 for two buffet breakfasts which at first seemed expensive but when compared to a UK hotel we stayed at the month before it was around the same price. However if you leave the hotel out of the Lexington Avenue exit and walk towards Central Park you will find several diners only a couple of blocks away who charged us around $25 for two huge buffet breakfasts! Much cheaper!!!! We also ate at the Bull and Bear and enjoyed some fab cocktails there - the meal was fantastic as were the cocktails and not too pricey!

But the beds were comfortable once we settled in. We were on the \"newly-remodeled\"(?) 10th floor. Our view was of the \"W\" hotel across the street. It was a decent, basic, nothing-special room. As we were there with teenagers, the TV reception was important. It was OK, but the stations higher on the dial (including the premium channels) were fuzzy. There was a good range of PPV movies. A note about parking: we drove down and left the car with the valet service, which charged $45/day. That seemed awfully steep and I was planning on leaving it there just the first night, but during our walks around the area (very convenient location, BTW) it became clear that, unless I wanted to stray more than a few blocks from the hotel, parking garages were charging $30/night and more anyways, so I left it there. I'm sure with more research you could find cheaper parking somewhere nearby, if it's important. Overall, we had a fun weekend. It was a 10-15 minute walk to Times Square, 5th Ave, Rockefeller Center.

The lobby is spectacular and an attraction in itself and its grandeur and splendour are unrivalled. The bedrooms are classic, quaint and tastefully decorated. The location is possibly better than any other hotel in New York, where most of the main attractions in Manhattan are within very short walking distance due to its location on Park Avenue (especially if you're into shopping!). The restaurants are superb. Oscars had superb breakfast buffet which I would never miss, and stake at the Bull and Bear was divine which is why it is literally one of the most famous restaurants in the world. There is a restaurant very nearby that I simply cannot ignore mentioning. It is an upscale Chinese restaurant almost next to the hotels back entrance called Mr. K's (570 Lexington Avenue). This is simply my favourite restaurant in the world. Immaculately clean, plush surroundings and design, and simply the best Chinese food i have ever had, they treat you like royalty here and be sure to pay it a visit.

Checking in, we were not able to be upgraded that night as they were sold out, but we were assured that an upgrade would be available the next day. My husband's a Hilton Diamond VIP member, so we usually get treated well! Exhausted from travel, we didn't mind and got a lovely room, although small, it was more than adequate - all marble in the bath, beautiful dark wood furniture. We went down to breakfast in the a.m. and out to the streets and upon our return, our luggage was transferred to the promised upgraded room. It was beautiful and roomy with a wonderful view of the Chrysler Building. We couldn't have been happier. We dined at Oscar's and although quite expensive, the food was fantastic, as were the martini's! If I have a complaint at all it was on the prices for room service. We decided to bite the bullet and order a hamburger and two beers and the bill came to forty some-odd dollars!! Outrageous, even for the Waldorf. Not to mention, two martini's in the bar came to $24/plus gratuity. But I guess that's just New York at it's finest! You gotta love the place. I'd go back in a heartbeat, and we plan to this year.

We had a mini king suite on the 23rd floor with views of Park Avenue. We could see down to Radio City Music Hall. The bed was very comfortable with a down duvet. Our room had lovely 10' ceilings and I even had a dressing room! I think when people complain about the age of the hotel, they just don't appreciate the history that the building contains. When I stay somewhere with history I don't expect it to look like it was brand new. The only damper on our stay was room service in the morning. They forgot our order 2 mornings we were there. It wasn't the order for room service you place the night before but ordered in the morning via phone. I understand they were very busy but to forget our order twice was a little upsetting.

It's just a very nice feeling to arrive at the Waldorf when checking in and for the money, it can be a very good value and here's why: This hotel does run specials quite often and you can actually get rooms here for around $200, a special which can occur more often than you think, especially if you book early. A very good bargain, considering a plain Manhattan Holiday Inn can be over $200. I payed $159 for the Sunday night I stayed on the 19th of December and I booked directly through the hotel's website. I was very happy about this bargain. I checked in at around 1:40 PM and it was easy and not a problem. The hotel staff is very good and friendly. Nice vibe I got from them. My room was very nice, actually spacious(seemed a little bigger than the standard rooms at the Plaza hotel) and comfortable. While the bathroom is small, it is very nice with marble. You'll get bigger bathrooms at the Ritz Carlton hotel but you'll also be paying over $400 a night there too. The bed in my room was wondeful, great down pillows and it was so comfortable to sleep on. You might wanna be careful about room service. It's insanely expensive. I ordered an apple pie and it was around $17! Even though room service is generally expensive at hotels, I only order it at special hotels that I like because it does feel good to get the service there. I wouldn't order room service at a typical Hilton hotel so the high price at the Waldorf was worth it. It's like, hey I'm getting room service at the freaking Waldorf baby! So that's how I rationalize it and I'll pay the higher price because it's like once in a life time that I'll probably do this, Ya know. So why not live the life for a few extra dollars more! Anway, the Waldorf has a pricy steakhouse called the Bull and Bear and I have to say that the steaks are outstanding! It was the best steak that I've ever had. I can honestly say this because I've eaten at many steak houses. I'm not saying that it's the best steak in New York but the standards are high at this joint. Side dishes were very good too. Very nice bartenders there too. Be sure to tip them well if they give you good service. I'll definetly be back for dinner on my next trip to New York City. In the lobby, there is a piano and it's actually a historic relic. It's the piano that was owned by Cole Porter who lived in the Waldorf. He's a famous jazz song writer and on the weekends, there is someone playing it for the crowd in the lobby and you can even order drinks there too. Very nice, especially hearing a piano that is a part of music history. Porter wrote many songs on that piano too. Just a little bit of trivial info about the Waldorf lobby. Checking out was very easy and lastly, one odd thing that I want to mention. I know it's a bit strange but when I come to New York, I like to bring my bike. I prefer this mode of transportation instead of cabs and public transportation. Anyway, the hotel let me store my bike for free in their parking garage! They actually have a bike rack where you can chain your bike. It was a nice feeling to know that my bike was safe in the hotel's garage. Usually I chain it to a pole on the street.

I had booked my mini king suite three weeks in advance on the hotel's website at the unbelievable rate of $239/night (unrestricted, too!) and was thrilled at the bargain as much as at the prospect of lodging at such a legendary hotel. The room was huge by any standard: 315 sq feet, with a king bed, a seating area, a kitchenette, marble bathroom with a separate sink/vanity area, two large closets, a desk with a fax/copier and internet connection, and views of the city from the fifteenth floor. I knew I should ask for a newly redecorated room, but it didn't seem like there was a choice: I got a room which had been renovated in 2000, which by hotel standards means it's up for renovation any time now. (My sister who's in hotel interiors tells me lesser hotels renovate every six years, good hotels renovate every four years - although in tough times they may try to get by with less frequent redecorating.) Well, knowing I had got a bargain I wasn't going to be difficult, and the room was just fine really. It was frayed at the edges, and could use an updated decor but even so, it wasn't tacky. I wouldn't want to spend my honeymoon in that particular room perhaps, but for a business traveler it is more than sufficient. For those expecting a deluxe hotel, note that this is not to be confused with the Waldorf Towers. The Astoria has Neutrogena toiletries, while the Towers offers Penhaligon's. I should warn you that room service is pricey! I ordered one cheese burger with no drink and the tab came to $40 with tip (hotels always charge you for the service yet they always leave a line for the tip anyway, which is a pet peeve of mine). However, I should also note that it was the most wonderful cheeseburger I'd had in a very long time, if ever! The fries were the best I'd tasted in the US. Clearly this was above standard hotel fare.

The windows actually opened and we could get fresh air! That was wonderful! The bathrooms were marble and clean, in the closet was a Waldorf ROBE for your use...lovely! There were heavy drapes on the windows so you could sleep in. The area is quiet (New York standards, but remember I live in a big City...Chicago, so I am used to the urban lull). If you are from a small town and not used to urban noises, New York itself will shock you, but seriously the rooms were CLEAN, NY QUIET and service was OUTSTANDING. The absolute BEST surprise was returning to the room after a looooooong day of shopping and walking to find that they TURNED DOWN the bed! Wow!

I called the front desk and they have a restaurant in the hotel named Oscars (or something like that) and they have it on the menu for $9. Well, I decided that a trip down to the casual restaurant would be just the ticket. So we went down and ordered. I ordered the tier platter (3 items) for about $15. What I got were the SMALLEST and I cannot stress the word 'smallest' enough, crabcakes I have ever seen, the SMALLEST Waldorf salad in the world! The crabcake was literally a little bigger than a quarter! The salad was about 3 bites of apples and walnuts. Excellent food, but I honestly can say this was the FIRST time I ever had to order out Chinese food AFTER I returned from a restaurant. My sweetie ordered the steak...The \"steak\" was a similar story here, at first glanced...looked like a steak, but was acutally 3 tiny strips of meat and a bunch of fillers (veggies, parsley) tucked under it that made it an \"illusion of meat\"! Overall the BEDS are comfortable. The marble bathrooms are CLEAN. They give you a ROBE to use! Classy! They turn down the beds....'nuff said! The SERVICE is outstanding.

When in New York, we love staying in the Waldorf or the towers due to the gracious, and elegant feel, as well as the location and service. We just spent two nights at the Waldorf and took our 2 year old son for the first time. We booked a two room Queen suite directly through the hotel, which upon request at check- in was upgraded to an enormous king suite with a kitchen, living room and dining area. For the same rate of $299.00 per night. ( The upgrades are not always available especially when the hotel is booked - I believe we just got lucky this time.) While I have seen better rates online through the discount websites, I have always booked directly through the hotel, so I know exactly what kind of room I am getting, and I feel more confident that the hotel will accomodate room changes or upgrades if we are not satisfied. In our experience, the rooms are always very clean and the staff is very personable. Our suite, while exceptional in size and luxury, had an outdated cooling system. It clanked a bit, and did not keep the room cool enough at night. This was unfortunate as we were not able to snuggle under the soft and sumptuous down comforters that are provided, and had to sleep without covers. If a comfortable, climate controlled enviornment is high on your list of expectations, make sure you ask when you book to reserve one of the renovated room with an up to date heating and cooling system. Room service, (which became necessary with our exuberant toddler experiencing sensory overload and boycotting naps) is very, very expensive. ie. last night my husband and I ordered 2 sirloin burgers, no extras, no beverages and with the service charge, tax and gratuity, paid almost $70.00. A simple, bare bones breakfast for 3 exceeds $100.00 While such expenses are expected in a high end Manhattan hotel, you may want to skip the Waldorf if you have a food budget and rely on room service occassionaly in order to enjoy a civilized meal if the children become cranky. The only other issue with the Waldorf (not at the towers) that we never noticed before because we never took our child, was that it is impossible to navigate the entrances and lobby with a stroller. They do not have ramps or elevators at the main entrance, and we had to drag our stroller up flights of stairs to get to the lobby. Very inconvenient. They told us there was a ramp around the back of the hotel, but after two days we never found it.

I checked in easily due to the fact that the Towers has it's own private check in area with no standing in line. The regular check in for the waldorf had about 30 people in line. The Towers is not that much more expensive. I chose the ambassador suite on the 30th floor. It is very large. It has a marble foyer area, a separate very large bedroom and a separate huge living room and a small kitchenette. The bathroom is very nice too. All marble with a large separate make-up sitting area. Roel, in the concierge was amazing. He knew EVERYTHING. Also I have to give a huge thumbs up to JOY in the travel area who helped with a town car for an afternoon of shopping. I also used the spa (plus 1) on the 19th floor. I had a manicure and a massage. The manicure was adequate but the massage was above average. They have a nice fitness center up there with all the up to date equipment. Nice helpful staff. Prices are really quite expensive though. If you like the grand old hotels with alot of history, then this is the hotel for you. If I had to say there is a downside to this hotel. It is the fact that they host a ton of weddings and company functions every weekend so the lobby is always packed with people. It doesn't feel very private or intimate. It's quite chaotic. That is why I chose the Towers because they have a very private check-in area. There own set of private elevators and their own private entrance. Also the St. Regis Hotel is very very nice too.

It also had the most comfortable bed I've ever laid on !The mini bar was kinda pricey - $8 for a coke but if you don't want to pay that then there's a grocery store nearby.The only downside came in the bar one evening when we spotted some large \"water bugs\" crawling on the wall. While I thought this slightly disconcerting the barman - an Alec Baldwin lookalike soon disposed of them, and we got an apology and free drinks courtesy of the manager !All in all NYC is a great place to stay and the Waldorf, while maybe not as grand as it used to be is still a first class hotel.", "Date": "April 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cWould Have preferred a Motel 6\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1765352", "Content": "This trip to New York was a present for my 18th Birthday back in Jan. We showed up at the Hotel Thrusday afternoon and proceeded to chek in, which is where our trip went a little sour. We were told that the Debit card we were using was not being accepted. We had to hand over all the cash we had on us to pay for the room to be able to put our stuff in our there before calling our bank. We had just switched banks and had not yet recieved my debit card for that account so I made a deposit in to my old account the day before leaving. Apparently, the Waldorf, according to my bank, had attempted to charge the card 12 time the night before and early morning of the day we arrived. Since the bank had yet to open and show the deposit it did not go through and red flagged my account. After discovering this we tried callign the front desk to speak to the woman who checked us in, no one ever called us back. I ended up getting my father to call and try to sort the mess out since my sister and I were left in New York with no cash and a debit card that we couldn't charge or withdraw anything with. After about 4 hours of getting no where with the hotel I thankfully discovered a card I didn't know I had in my wallet and held the room with that until the next morning when the debit card went through. During all this I found the staff to be quite rude and not at all helpful. It completley ruined the first day of our trip. On top of that our second day there we came back to the hotel around 9pm and room service still hadn't been there, and you can't get a decent temperature in the shower to save your life.

We looked into staying at the Waldorf due to its proximity to the American Girl Place store and its advertised \"American Girl Place special\" since we were taking our two young daughters to New York to visit that store. When making our reservation, I specified that we needed connecting rooms or a suite that had a room with two double beds, as our kids can't sleep together in one bed and get any rest. I was told I had reserved a two-bedroom luxury suite featuring one king bed room and a room with two double beds. When we got to the hotel at 5:15 p.m., we were told the suite was not yet ready, although check-in is 3 p.m.; half an hour later when we were sent to the room, housekeeping was still there and the rooms had not yet been made up -- AND the second bedroom had only one large bed. After numerous phone calls, a manager told us the Waldorf has no suites with the bed configuration I was told we had booked (which was pretty much the whole reason we booked there at all), and simply offered to provide a rollaway bed. Their initial attitude was that it was our problem and they weren't going to do anything besides send up the rollaway. After we pushed the issue, we were offered a complimentary buffet breakfast, and later the hotel reduced the price of the suite.(Though we requested that the rollaway be sent right away at 6 p.m. since our kids were so tired, it didn't show up until 9 p.m.) While the rooms themselves were decent, there were many surprising defects for a hotel of its reputation -- only one bathrobe, no makeup or shaving mirror, a cigarette burn through one of the curtains, and torn carpeting in the lobby held together with electrical tape.

Our suite rate was $320/night - our friend's regular room was $225/night. Great location. Walking distance to everything. Never had a problem getting a cab. One bad incident - when we arrived, a hotel bellman litterally chewed out our cab driver. The ugliest I've ever seen any human be to another. The cab driver dropped us off on the Park Ave side - apparently he was not supposed to do that. But what a rude greeting by hotel staff! As we stepped out of our cab, we were told by another bellman that we would not be able to check into our room and he would \"have to take our bags.\" I politely said thanks, but we'll check inside at the front desk first.
