Nice property, cute decor, friendly staff. Room service was very friendly and courteous, as well as the front desk. My only complaint about the property is that our room had no accessible electrical outlets. Zero. Nada. This explains why some of the furniture in the room was moved at odd angles away from the walls - so that the hidden electrical outlets behind the desk and nightstand could be found. There was a very nice and spacious computer desk, for example - but NO electrical outlets to use!! We had to pull the desk out further so that we could reach around to plug in our laptops. Same for charging the phone on the nightstand. This is a very easy issue to resolve - they need to install mounted power strips for easy access. This is obvious, but but I guess that doesn't keep people from ignoring it. At any rate - bring a power strip. More about the area: Japantown is a surprisingly nice and quiet area to stay, with an authentic Japanese urban feel. Unlike Chinatown, Japantown is an actual established Japanese community in the Pacific Heights area of the city. Lots of Japanese-Americans live in and work in this area - but there seemed to be very little tourist traffic overall. No crowds whatsoever... just a lot of \"local\" Japanese - it was a great place to start and end the day during our visit.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara, California", "Title": "\u201cNo hot water?\u201d", "Author": "Chad B", "ReviewID": "UR129031602", "Content": "I was on the 3rd floor. The first morning I took a shower and it was really cold. I went to the front desk later to inquire about it and unsurprisingly I was told it was probably cold because they had a full house and everyone uses the showers in the morning. He promised to have someone check my plumbing, but that was it. He just expected me to understand that predictably everyone in the place was using the shower in the morning (like you do) and therefor the water was cold. The next day I got up a little earlier and it was still quite cold, though not as unbearably as the first morning. I wouldn't hand out such a bad review all the time, but for me a one star means unsafe or unsanitary, and a two means that the hotel is missing the bare minimum amenities to be comfortable. Having a hot shower in the morning is pretty much all I require, and if a hotel doesn't provide that then it's just not acceptable.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redding, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - Bad Value\u201d", "Author": "pharmgreg", "ReviewID": "UR129006425", "Content": "Stayed at the Tomo on Cherry Blossom weekend.

First of all, the location is excellent. The hotel is located in the heart of Japantown, which is a great combination of interesting and safe. The restaurants and shops are plenty and good: definitely worth exploring. It is also blocks away from the stylish Filmore street where you can find excellent restaurants, bars and upscale boutiques. BART and many of the areas' most popular tourist attractions are a short bus ride away. Second, Hotel Tomo has large, clean rooms. The king-bed room that I stayed in was large enough to accommodate two adults comfortably and came with a good-size bathroom (unlike those tiny little ones found in many of the SF hotels), plenty of workspace, and FREE in-room wifi (for which many other hotels charge an exorbitant fee). The room was clean when I checked in. On one of the days of my stay, the maid did a sloppy job of cleaning it, but it was good the rest of the time. The decor of the room and the hotel is fun and quirky. If you are a fan of anime/manga, you will love it. If you prefer a more \"traditional\" hotel decor, you might feel a bit puzzled at staying at a room that is decorated like a bedroom of a Japanese teenager. I personally liked it. Although I am far from a teenager by decades, it was nice to stay in a room that felt more like a bedroom in a home than an impersonal/bland hotel room, especially when it had all the comforts of a hotel. Third, the value is great. It was cheaper than the B&B (as lovely in a vintage-sort of way as it was) I stayed at in my last trip! The restaurant in the hotel serves both \"American\" and Japanese breakfast options at a reasonable price (I enjoyed the Japanese option, which was excellent). Fourth, the staff at the hotel were efficient and attentive. To me, this is important. One tip: Although the hotel offers parking ($25 plus parking tax), you can park your car at the nearby Japan Center parking lot for much cheaper ($19, including the tax). I didn't find out about this until the last day, but now you know!", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGood value and comfort\u201d", "Author": "deranieri", "ReviewID": "UR125757411", "Content": "The Hotel Tomo is a great value in a city that has a tendency toward great hotel expense.

However, its important to keep in mind this is no luxury accomodations and the sub-Ikeaish furniture and murals are initially cute but wear off quickly. They apparently have a problem with their irons being stolen and I found it quite annoying to have to try and iron with the iron tied to the ironing board. The Japantown location isnt great. Its not really in walking distance to anything. However, the number 2 and 3 muni bus stop is right across the street and comes about every 20 min. providing access to Union Sq. If you are coming from the airport contact the hotel for shuttle transportation ($16 one way). Otherwise, tthe BART is $9 to the nearest station to the hotel and then $2 for the bus to the hotel-- much easier and quicker to take the shuttle. I did not find the hotel restaurant to be very good. However, there is an excellent Thai restaurant right across the street on Buchanan St. that offers very good food at reasonable prices.

The first day we went for breakfast there. I took continental and I got a bun and a cup of tea. My husband took egg, sausage and toast with coffee. We paid more than 30$ for it!!! We put on the table 40$ and waited for 15min for the change! Once they realize we are not leaving without our 10$ they brought the change. After this we didn't even think of leaving the tip. Additionally, we were served like: eat and get out. To make it clear it's a Japanese restaurant so the staff is Japanese (at I assume so). Except us there were few Asian families. They were served and left in peace to eat. We were served and once one of us finished (me that one small bun) they took away from me the plate, than the cup were I had tea - all made us feel like \"just eat, get out and leave a big tip\"...

But it seems that someone came up with the brilliant idea to go way left of center with the inevitable renovation. Rather than aspiring to some kind of zen retreat ala the nearby Kabuki Hotel, why not do something cheap but fun? Instead of dark stained ebony, use knotty pine. Instead of images of geishas and crashing waves, why not channel kitschy Harajuku and manga fabulousity? The result is something that is less Akira Kurosawa and more Akira, the animated manga movie. The Hotel TOMO! was born. The room itself was very large, especially by San Francisco standards, and was quite comfortable and stylish, including a flat screen TV, a hanging George Nelson ball lamp and free wi-fi.

Pros: - decent size rooms for an OK price (~100-120 per night); - the hotel can accommodate 4 people, so it may be good for families with kids; - small fridge in the room. Cons: - location. The hotel is in a pretty safe area, BUT it is about 1-3 miles from any place you would want to be. If you are disinclined to walk for half and hour to an hour to the spot you actually want to walk through, you're stuck taking 2-3 buses each way. Munis are good (run every 10-15 minutes normally), but by the end of the trip I got sick and tired of taking buses everywhere. There are hotels in about the same price range in MUCH better locations. - Wifi (free in-room) is horrendous. My e-mail took 1-2 minutes to load. Most websites didn't load at all. A few other guests I chatted with had the same problem. Ethernet was only a touch faster. In this day and age, having such slow internet is inexcusable. I travel a lot and this is by far the worst connection I ever had to use. Other issues: - the hotel is tired, everything is well worn and / or dirty. The pillowcases were torn in several places. The sheets were slightly stained and worn through from the wear. The mattress covers... don't get me started. - decor: I know they're going for something hip and original. Unfortunately, the decor comes off silly and ugly. The rooms are dark. the bathroom light is so dim you can barely see anything. The toilet and bathtub/shower is separated from the sink (makes for filthy door handles). The whole thing - a turn off, though personally not a deal breaker. - customer service (lack thereof) and security. I do not appreciate a friend of mine being able to get a new key to my room without even showing id. Pretty much anyone off the street could get access to my room. The next time he tried, he was asked for id. But consistency in security policies is essential. Overall, my trip was decent, but I will definitely stay elsewhere next time.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, OR", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, clean and friendly.\u201d", "Author": "holymilo", "ReviewID": "UR90034237", "Content": "Funny how paint and a good concept can make a Best Western seem like something else.

Booked because of the good price I got ($90CA+tax per night) on Expedia, reasonable location, and the overwhelmingly positive reviews. On the positive side the room was nice and clean, recently renovated, the bed comfortable (we slept very well), the bathroom clean. The decor is cheery. We were on the top floor and could not hear any noise from neighbors. The location is reasonable, as long as you can stomach (or avoid) Filmore street where there is obvious poverty and it looks like a rough area, and as long as you don't mind asian food, since there is not much else in the immediate vicinity (except for Filmore St). There is a large IGA at 5 minutes walk where you can stock up on stuff for breakfast and right next to it there is also a laundromat. On the negative side, the windows are old (original) single pane, sliding, with metallic frame. Ours was facing west so there was quite a bit of heat gain, even with the curtains closed. The air conditioning does not work, regardless of the setting of the thermostat in the room, until someone complains to the front desk staff. Then, they turn it on. The official spin is that it needs to be \"reset\". I think management is just trying to save on electricity costs and they turn it way down for the whole building.

It seemed difficult to find San Francisco hotel rooms that had 2 beds. Not at the Tomo! We would highly recommend this place if you are interested in Japantown or need to be close to UCSF. The rooms were nicely furnished and decorated. Everything was well maintained and modern looking. Our room had a bean bag chair, which my grandson enjoyed. The bathroom was spotless in every way. The area felt very safe for walking around outside, which may not always be the case in San Francisco. The price was very reasonable. Union square is nearby by bus. My grandson wanted pizza and we found it 2 blocks down. We rode the BART in from Dublin/Pleasanton and rode the Muni around town. It was a great way to get around and not have to be concerned about parking or driving. The day we left the hotel, my 15 y/o grandson and I went on the Electric Tour Company Segway tour and would highly recommend it. Then we went to the Alcatraz tour, which was great, too. I had not done the grounds tour before and it was so nice to look out at the Golden Gate from another view. The hour long audio tour is very well done, too. We asked our Segway tour operator if she would recommend any hotels near the Wharf and she stated, \"no, too touristy.\" If I went back, I may just be willing to stay outside the wharf tourist area and get much more value for my money at the Tomo.

Free wifi and internet access in the hotel lobby proved very useful, although an extension of the wifi to the bedrooms would have been appreciated. The staff were knowledgeable, competent and polite if a little unfriendly, and could only provide very limited transfer of travellers cheques which proved an inconvenience. The location of the hotel is excellent, away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist spots such as Union Square, but very central for excursions to Golden Gate Bridge and Park as well as Fisherman's Wharf, all of which were easily accessible by one or two convenient bus rides. Nowhere took more than 20 minutes to reach, and a handy shuttle service is available to the airport at a reasonable price. One of the few downsides was the hotel bar/restaurant, which specialised in Shabu Shabu Japanese cuisine. The service and food were fine, but it felt a bit unwelcoming and not the sort of place you'd want to spend long visiting. All in all, if you don't care about the hotel bar, an excellent choice of hotel.", "Date": "October 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and nice atmosphere\u201d", "Author": "Quinn7188", "ReviewID": "UR47104181", "Content": "This hotel is located just on the edge of Japantown in San Francisco, so the style of the hotel is asian-influenced and very trendy.

It was both good and bad, hence the middling rating. It's obviously an older best western re-done in a cute J-Pop style. The bedrooms themselves are funky and bright in an Ikea-meets-Japan sort of way. Very clean. Although, for reasons I can't understand, someone thought painting a windowless interior bathroom dark grey and adding an opaque dark gray shower curtain and installing a single low wattage florescent bulb was a good idea. Unless you're a fan of prisons, it wasn't. However, the shower had good water pressure and lots of hot water. Beds, linens, and towels and such were all of the quality I would expect of a mid-priced hotel. When we first checked in at the front desk in the late afternoon, the desk clerk was indifferent. He gave us the key card and we headed up to the room only to discover it wasn't what we had booked. We'd paid for an upgrade to a upper room with a balcony. So we schlep back downstairs. He gives us another room key to the right room. It was a very long traveling day so we decide to just get snacks at the market (nice to have one nearby!) and settle in for evening of being couch potatoes and watching pay-per-view. Except the pay per view movies didn't work. We call down stairs to inquire what the problem could be. Mr. Personality at the desk says he doesn't know, and \"I don\u2019t know what to tell you.\" When we indicate that it's really kinda his job to know these things, he tells us his colleague who actually knows something about the hotel systems will be in a half hour. As promised, a half hour or so later, the competent employee shows up. He fiddles with the cable box, indicates that it is indeed broken and offers to move us to yet another room. So we switch rooms for a third time. In fairness, the nighttime employee was very helpful and accommodating, he apologized, brought a cart to tote the luggage and gave us a free pass for a couple breakfasts at the hotel dining room. That was nice, considering the day-shift guy's attitude was \"hey, sucks to be you.\" While the hotel offers free wireless, forget actually trying to use it for more than a couple minutes at a time. It's intermittent at best and drops out constantly. They outsource the service and it took multiple phone calls to get the service running. Even with help, it's not consistent. If you actually plan on doing some work, you will be frustrated. The next day, again, we come back to the room that night to find that TV and lamp in the desk area isn't working. We fiddle with the surge protector under the desk to no avail. We call down. Guy comes up. Apparently the surge protector has to be \"jiggled\" just right in the outlet. I can only guess that the maid accidently unjiggled it while sweeping. (frankly the wiring and multiple extension cords all looked like a fire waiting to happen) On the day we left, we went to the house computers to print out our boarding passes. Attached to both the computers were \"out of order signs\" indicating that they wouldn't be fixed until the next day. The woman at the desk was nice enough to log on and print out the passes. That evening, I I had to go to three different floors to find a coke machine that actually worked. No exaggeration. So we met two very good employees and one very indifferent one. The room was nice, the bathroom was creepy and there were multiple issues with the amenities. The front desk did eventually make some monetary adjustments for all of the inconveniences, and that was nice, of course. I don't expect perfection, but I do expect problems to be corrected, alleviated, or compensated, which eventually they were. But equally, they would not have had to make such concessions IF items just worked as they are intended to in the first place. While the hotel is cute and it's in a nice location, but they really need to put some money into their infrastructure.

Several times we called for replacement items of Kleenex, etc., and housekeeping was at our door within minutes.

Two additional bonuses: Free wireless internet (or the desk will also provide a cable), and a very nice \"Little Gym\" with a rubberized floor, mats, free weights, a treadmill, an elyptical, and a bike.

The bathroom was a typical Best Western bathroom and the shower area was very dark. The room was fairly clean, though, and it was a different experience. The bed is comfortable and the linens are decent. I'm a fan of the location - safe area with many eating choices, supermarkets, bus stop right in front of the hotel, away from the bustle of tourists.

There was no trouble with our room and although we were on the 8th floor, the lift was speedy. The room itself was bright and airy and really quite large. The hotel is based on a Japanese theme, and our room had a flavor of the East, with futon stle furniture and a quite odd but funky mural covering one room. We liked the room! There was a dressing area with a lit sink and wardrobe, the bath, shower and toilet were in a separate room, and were a tad dark. The staff were always very friendly and answered any questions we had. There is a restaurant atached to the hotel. We ate there the first night, and although the staff were lovely, the food was average, so didn't go back. There are plenty of Asian restaurants in the area, with a shopping centre 2minutes walk from the hotel. Directly opposite the hotel is a deli, which sold nice sandwiches! The hotel had icemachines and drinks machines on alternate floors, however we had to go to floor 4 to find a working ice-machine and the restrooms in the lobby were out of service for our stay. However there was free internet access with a printer available in the lobby! There was also a small gym, which my partner used once. The rooms were cleaned everyday with the hotel operating a policy where you put a card on the bed if you want new sheets and towels in the bath if you want them replacing. The room also had an iron and ironing board which was great! Added extras included a funky i-pod alarm clock and a flat screen TV! Location was fine. The area was fairly quiet and we felt safe.

Not only was it right across the street from Japantown -- Bus Lines 2, 3, 4 pass through the bus stop across the street and 4 blocks north (beware of the hills!!!) is another bus stop (Bus Line 1) that takes you a few blocks away from the Ferry Building. The area is pretty safe and quiet. A lot of the restaurants in Japantown stay open so there is still plenty to do late at night. However, I do want to add that almost every night I did hear sirens in the distance. But I'm not sure how close by they were. There were only a few down sides. The walls were not always thick enough (a light-sleeper friend of mine woke up to the sounds of people next door) and he was allergic to the goose down in the pillows.

I anticipated having the same problems - rude service, slamming doors, lousy wifi connection, and fickle heating. However, given the uniqueness of Hotel Tomo, I was willing to give it a shot. I honestly can say that this hotel far surpassed my expectations and catered to all of my needs for my trip (efficient service, quiet floor, clean room, cool environment). Having said this, readers should keep in mind that this hotel IS a mid-range Best Western, and is neither a five star hotel nor a hostel. You won't get room service or ear-to-ear smiles from the staff, but you needn't worry about comfort, cleanliness, or safety. The service was great - I checked in quite late without any hitches, asked directions and questions of the front desk, and requested taxis from the staff. As my return flight was at 10 pm, the staff was quite amiable about storing my luggage, and actually refused a tip upon retrieving my bags! What prompted me to give this hotel an \"excellent\" score was the fact that a personalized letter from the head housekeeper was left on my desk, and the \"guest experience\" manager left a message on my phone to call her extension if I needed anything during my stay. During my visits to much higher end hotels, I only received these types of gestures when doing business with these properties. As just a \"regular\" guest, I found their messages quite personal and reassuring. The wifi worked perfectly, as did the tea kettle, alarm clock, A/C, and in-room safe. Yuzu-bergamot toiletries and the cushy robe were nice touches, and it was nice waking up to my own music on my ipod. A printer and two computers are available in the lobby for printing out boarding passes, maps, etc. Location is a bit far from the touristy parts of SF, but dead in the heart of Japantown. It was nice to be able to grab take-out ramen from Tanpopo and be back in my room within 5 minutes. A great Korean spa is only a few minutes away as well. A few minor CONS: Housekeeping staff did come knocking at my door at 8:30 am. Fortunately, I was already up, but for those wanting to sleep late, remember to hang that \"Do Not Disturb\" sign before you turn out the lights. Free breakfast may be too much to ask for, but putting complimentary coffee/tea/fruit in the lobby would be a nice touch. Overall, I would definitely stay here again. If you're not a fan of anime or don't have a sense of humor about the Tomo's decor (i.e., you're \"scared\" of the room murals!), I would advise you to look elsewhere.

This hotel is soooo cool! The decor is amazing. Rooms are very clean and decent size. We had a small balcony with a view of the neighborhood. It is located in Japantown. It is not walking distance to the main attractions, but you can take a cab for about $6-7 into union square. Or you can take a bus. I usually always stay in Union Square when visiting San Francisco, but I really enjoyed staying in a different location. It's very quiet and safe to walk around even late at night. There are tons of great restaurants around the hotel. The Hotel even has a cool shabu-shabu restaurant. However I did not get a chance to eat there. The staff is very friendly and helpful. It is a great deal too. Much less than all the other hotels in touristy areas of San Francisco. I will totally stay here again!!", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Genk, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cHotel Tomo, a pleasure to stay at!\u201d", "Author": "MrSmid", "ReviewID": "UR17307640", "Content": "Travelling around the USA is a great thing. Staying in excellent hotels during the trip is even greater! Hotel Tomo was one of them and I certainly advise this hotel to everyone who likes to stay in a nice quiet neighbourhood close to downtown San Francisco. The nice people at the front desk gave us a warm welcome and even gave us a phonecall 10 mins after we entered our room, just to make sure everything was alright. We had a double bed (excellent beds by the way) room, with an LCD television, a radio (you could even hook your iPod up it), a nice shower and badroom.

They are both Anime fans so we chose this hotel for the theme. The room was comfortable for the four of us for five days. The location was the best! Not only was it right in Japan Town and only a block from Japan Center, it is on a major muni route. We parked the car and didn't worry about it until we left. We were less than 30 minutes from everything we wanted to see, the Haight, Union Square, Pier 39 and many museums. The staff was helpful and cordial the whole time. There is limited parking at the hotel but they use the Japan Center lot as overflow and were very helpful with loading and unloading. The view was terrific and the rooms clean and well kept.

The only hotel with two Queen beds within our price range, and surprisingly, there were no other hidden charges upon checking in. The receptionist was a little stingy about giving out four bus maps. However, the room was very clean and very roomy. There is a huge bean bag chair and also a bench by the window. We stayed on 2nd floor but not noisy at all. The room decor is very modern and to our likings. Room has extra blankets which came in handy on cold SF nights while we were there. Close to Bus # 2, 3, 4, 22 and I believe 32 which can take you to union square, golden gate bride and alamo square park. We bought a 3 days muni pass for $ 18 at union sq and used it to take buses, cable car and street car all three days.

I thought the hotel was fine, and we didn't have any problems with noise as some of the other reviews have stated, so either we got lucky, or we are heavy sleepers which is definitely not the case. The hotel itself is okay, it was recently redone so everything was very new looking, and the decor is exactly what you would expect from this type of place. If you are staying a j-pop themed hotel, don't expect antiquity or that nothing will look like plastic. I thought that the rooms were very spacious, and the bed was a good size and comfortable. The location is just okay, but we chose this specific hotel in mind as it is within easy walking distance to the Fillmore.

The bean bag chair is not as comfortable as it looks. It has a ipod docking alarm clock which my daughter likes and a LCD TV. It is located right in the Japantown, so it is very convenient if you like Japanese food at reasonable price. Japan Center has other stores too. It is a fun experience to browse and walk around. When we came back late one night, the hotel parking was full so I had to park at the Japan Center. With the receipt, the hotel waive the over night parking fee. It is a very short walk and I find it safe walking at night. There is a Japanese cafe right across the street from the hotel. We had the breakfast there. Many locals stop there so you get a local feel. The bakery makes mochi (rice cake) there. It is delicious so we bought a box to go. The bakery has been in busuiness for many years.

If their small parking lot is full as it was one night they send you to the public parking lot aroung the corner and reminburse the parking fee.

The prices were as great as the service. Location was great, right inside Japantown with a bustop in front headed to downtown(really made our 3day passes worth it). It's also not too far from the California St. Cablecar. Check-in was quick and easy and went straight to the room. Rooms were everything we hoped for and more. We were on the third floor and both rooms were clean, cozy, and had nice views of Japantown. Never had a problem with the complimentary internet(had two macs with us) which was great. Doors closed a little hard but no big deal. Even a few friends from SF came to visit were impressed enough to decide to recommend it and also plan to stay themselves in the future. Service was great all around, we left a jacket there that somehow got stuck under the mattress/bed and they flipped the room upside down to find it.
