The beds were shoddy and dirty. The mattresses were sunken in the middle and there were bloodstains on the sheets. They smelled like an outhouse! We were horrified! We decided as a group to get a refund and to try to find a hotel outside of Seattle. When we asked the Korean man for a refund he rudely told us that too much time had passed and he was not going to give us our money back. He told us that the best he could do was to give us a new room. We had spent the last of our money on the room and the car was too small to sleep in, so we were forced to stay in that hell hole! When we arrived at the new room, the only thing that had changed was that the door actually had a lock on it. When I inspected the bathroom, I almost retched! The floor, tub, toilet, and sink had suspicious brown stains all over them and the mirror was broken.

One of the girls on the trip accidentally left a charger to her camera plugged into the wall and when they went back to the King's Inn to ask if anyone had seen it and brought it to the front desk, the clerk (the one who was rude earlier that day) said that he didn't know anything about it and that the maids would have been the ones to have it. But he didn't have a key to the maid's closet and couldn't get ahold of them on the phone to ask. They went back at the appropriate time that the maids were supposed to be there, but they found out that the clerk had told them wrong and that the maids came in the mornings. This place may have been cheap, but she said that she did not feel safe (because sometimes the doors did not lock), and she would have paid some of her own money (that was meant for shopping on the cruise) to stay somewhere else.

I was first approached on the balcony by an african fellow who wondered if I had \" that Creme\" for him. This was only the first of many attempts to lure me into a room by many of the motels occupants.

But the sheets are clean and changed daily. The noise that other people were talking about did not materilize beyond the normal street noise of a big city downtown. The one thing that I noticed, is that it is fairly cold in the room at night (my stay was in November) and the air conditioners that serve as heaters are pretty noisy but bearable.", "Date": "November 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cNever Again!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3551385", "Content": "I will never stay at this place again. The photo's in their listing are very misleading, the room I was in doesn't even come near resembling the one in the picture. The Room in MAJOR need of updating. The matress was old and sagging EVERYWHERE, the carpet was dirty, the paint on the walls peeling. The bath tub was mildewy, and rust stained, the light fixture was wired in with the wire running up the wall across the cieling, and over to the fixture. The light fixture was held together with Masking tape. The mirror in the bathroom was broken on the edges in several places, leaving sharp edges easy to cut yourself on. The tv was plugged in using a long, thin extension cord over to the other wall. They lock the gates at 11pm so you can't get your car out of the garage, and you have to buzz to get onto the property to get to your room.

This definitely was low. Southwest Airlines recommended this motel and we made reservations for 3 nights. We drove in late from Vancouver (1:30 a.m.) and boy were we surprised. There is a sliding barrier gate that is locked after a certain hour to keep out non-guests. They needed it as two guys off the very noisy entrance street tried to get in \"to visit a friend\" when we checked in. When they were made to leave they were shouting discrimination because we were getting in. People were wandering around the hotel all night making lots of noise. The room was musty and needed renovation. Remote control missing from it's anchored spot on the nightstand. At 3 a.m. husband had had enough of the noise and wanted to leave but we stuck it out til daylight and checked out. Sleeping arrangements have made a huge leap in our priorities. We lost half a day of seeing Seattle by sleeping the next day out of exhaustion.

It smelled bad, the T.V. barely worked, the wallpaper was falling off the wall and patched elsewhere, the mattress was old and sagging (very sore backs in the morning), the toilet wouldn't flush unless we played with the handle for a while and the in wall heater under the window was broken so we had a floor heater sitting on the floor in this already very tiny room. A few doors down from us was a group of young men who were there explicitly for partying. They were yelling, running back and forth (by our room), thowing plastic ice buckets and hanging off the banisters, on and off, throughout the night. I did not sleep. Being from Victoria we started our trip at 4 a.m. so we were very tired and ended up here because we had tried so many places and just got tired of looking. We visit Seattle several times a year and have for tweny-five, but we decided on that night that Seattle just isn't worth it anymore.

Rate was about $60 a night which isn't too bad considering the location near downtown where average prices are twice as much. One good thing is that there is some parking available at the motel unlike some other motels in the area. The room was small but adequete and had a musty/cigarette smell but otherwise was clean. Bathroom was small but clean and complimentary soap and towels as well as a shower. As with some other reviews, it is a bit noisy with the traffic and el-train going by but was tolerable since we were close to many of the downtown things we were wanting to go to.
