As context, over the past 12 months I have stayed in hotels for more than 150 nights as I travel regularly for my employment. Against all of those hotels, the good, bad and ugly, Hotel 1000 very clearly distinguishes itself at the very top of the list. Based on something like 10 stays, I cannot name a single thing I would suggest needs improvement. Specific factors that make this place so outstanding for me include: -an absolute first-rate attitude toward guest service, shared by every single member of the staff, displayed in every interaction -amazing rooms, with furnishings and fixtures that are just superb, and panoramic harbour views if you end up on the water side -a great location steps from Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, etc. -a tremendous restaurant and bar, fantastic bartenders", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWorth Every Penny\u201d", "Author": "Rhiannon5", "ReviewID": "UR127542969", "Content": "Yes, it is like the photos where we could see that a nearby hotel was not.

Found this hotel through Hotels.com and experienced what I thought was a great stay despite the fact that the wireless connectivity did not work and this was a business stay. Fortunately it was possible to use direct wired connection, but the hotel did not provide LAN cables long enough to work at a desk or table, which made things quite difficult. Nonetheless, I checked out a happy customer. However, I found multiple charges on my credit card on the days following checkout - much more than I actually owed, one for $1000 (on top of another for $123.10). I called the hotel to find out what was going on, and they told me that it was a charge for a cracked screen on the TV! I can't believe this. There were 2 TVs in this room, both LCD and I watched them both and they were just fine when I left. Now I am waiting to hear back from a manager because the front desk wasn't able to resolve this issue? PS. expensive parking (almost $40 per night). I won't be back after all. Taking this much time to resolve an issue like this is beyond ridiculous. My husband and I are 50 something business people, not rock stars who damage hotel rooms.

The bell desk offered umbrellas and attentive service as well as easy directions and great suggestions for places to go and how to get there. The bar staff at Boka was also very friendly and personable. On the multiple occasions that we visited the bar, they were entertaining and made great cocktails. The in-room mini-bar is quite well stocked; unfortunately, it didn't leave room for the small items that we picked up throughout the week. - Beechers and Cougar Gold don't survive well at room temps. There may well have been small refrigerators available had we asked, sadly, we didn't think of it until we left. The only hiccup we encountered was the service in the Golf Club which was not up to the same great standards as everything else in the hotel. We waited for an hour before a server checked on us only to have them forget our cocktails twice and to bring our check at the end of our game. While the hotel is a great location for accessing Pike Place Market and the waterfront (cruises, ferries, the Aquarium) it's a bit further from the retail district - Pacific Place, Nordstrom, Westlake Center, etc. and if you're planning to visit the Space Needle, EMP, Pacific Science Center, it's a small trek through Belltown.

I couldn\u2019t help but try my hand at a few games I\u2019d never seen on the Microsoft Surface touch screen table while I warmed up from the wet Seattle weather. ROOMS The rooms at Hotel 1000 range from 390 square-feet to the 2,000 square-foot Grand Suite. Every room has another distinctive touch \u2013 a unique pedestal bathtub that fills from the ceiling. As cool as that is, what is a bathtub without a rubber ducky? Clearly this hotel thinks like I do because one was waiting for me, perched on the side of the impressive tub! Each room is equipped with a coffee maker (although why not take full advantage of the delicious coffee steps away in any direction? This is Seattle!). The modern slate blue and rust room d\u00e9cor goes the extra mile with beds bejeweled in Thai linens and down pillows. In addition, most lights are dimmable. Finally! The rooms and suites feel like downtown apartments. Although the design elements are consistent throughout the hotel, the ambiance in each room is personal. I could easily imagine coming home to a suite like the ones in this hotel after a day spent at the famous Public Market. BEYOND THE ROOMS I am not a golfer, but I know fun when I see it. Downstairs from the lobby is The Golf Club, a \u201cstate-of-the-art virtual golf\u201d room with two stations. The golfer stands on turf and lets the ball fly onto a floor-to-ceiling fabric screen that mimics a course. Depending on how the ball hits the screen, the score is tallied. I can honestly say it is the best game of golf I\u2019ve ever played. DINING My husband and I dined in Boka, Hotel 1000\u2019s in-house restaurant, for breakfast the morning after we checked-in. Our server brought us a complimentary basket of pastries that made waiting for the food a pleasure. There are two entrances to Boka, one from the hotel\u2019s lobby and one from the street.

The bed was perfect, the Television was clear and worked quickly, which I can't say about many hotels. The decorations were great, I loved the art on the walls. Design couldn't be better, neither could the soaps and toiletries. I can't rave enough about how much I loved this location. Even the hotel restaurant was amazing. I ordered the chicken and waffles, Mac and Cheese, three cocktails, and paid less than I did at my last hotel for a Philly Cheese steak and a coke! The prices were amazing, almost as amazing as the food and drinks. But I will say that the drinks are either on the Tart or Sweet side. Every time I was told a drink was not too sweet or too sour, I felt that it was. My only other qualm, was that my room key was deactivated before I had departed and the woman I called on the phone at the concierge desk (not front desk), was not very friendly, so I went to the front desk and they were happy to help me.

When I retrieved my car from valet parking, they put fresh bottles of water in the front, offered directions, and held out the seatbelt to make seating easier \u2013 the parking staff was obviously very well trained on service.

As I approached the hotel and entered, from the staff that greeted me and opened the door, to the concierge, to the check in staff, everybody was friendly and professional. The ambience of the hotel, albeit with a no-nonsense lobby area, is crisp and trendy. There's a side room connected to the lobby with the large, modern fireplace for a cozy area to relax out of the cold. Again, the Hotel1000 staff is always pleasant, clean, and prompt to see if they can be of any service to me. They don't wait for me to approach them, which is great and shows an attention to service. The staff does seem to be on the younger side, but don't count that as a negative. They bring their energy without losing any courteousness. Since that first visit, I've stayed here a number of times. A couple times I was upgraded to a suite, without me asking if one was available. They have a firm understanding that all guests should be treated well, but they also have a great understanding that repeat guests should be made to feel extra special. This is good business and also really builds the relationship and loyalty. All of the rooms I've stayed in were nice, clean, and spacious. Good, classy decorations are used and the walls and furniture have a calm, warm color palette (no gaudy or dingy furniture here). The layouts of the rooms are open. The tubs with the ceiling spouts are an interesting feature. The only small complaint I might say is there needs to be more room lighting for after the sun goes down, BUT I would say this about all hotels. I just like it bright. To be fair, these rooms are some of the brighter ones I've stayed at for hotels. The BOKA restaurant attached to the hotel is a great place to eat when you don't want to head out to find another restaurant. Breakfast is particularly good, especially with the complementary bread basket. I would say it would be nice to have a larger selection of entrees (but maybe that's because I've eaten there so many times), but overall not a bad array of choices. As mentioned, whenever I have visited Seattle I have stayed at this hotel, and the one time I didn't was because the hotel was all booked. Bummer.

My take is that the staff is just a bit too green (mostly young kids) and could use more training to get them to a '5 star' service level. Again, not bad...but not great either. Also, while the french press is nice, Hotel 1000 should step it up a bit and upgrade the Starbucks bag of coffee for some local beans. As a bonus, the hotel is dog friendly, providing complimentary dog bed, biscuits, dog bowls and toy. But they surprisingly don't have any ready to go dog walking service (I'd expect this for a top of the line hotel in a big city).

Starting with the check-in, both of the desk staff were wonderful, and went out of their way, to make my wife's birthday celebration special. They greeted us with champagne and a rose for my wife, and upgraded us to a water view room. I booked time at the Golf Club, a virtual golfing experience at the Hotel. It was fantastic, and I would highly recommend it to anyone. The manager introduced us to the experience, how to use it, and turned us loose. I got to play St Andrews with my wife! While playing, we had very attentive service from the onsite restaurant, Boka, enjoying a cold adult beverages, and a very tasty gourmet pretzel / hot dog bites. The rooms are spectacular and romantic.

I was dissapointed in the value of the hotel. I made the decision to pay extra to upgrade my room two levels, from The basic room to the grand luxe corner suite. Staff: C- Check-in was nothing more than average. Front desk staff was pleasant but no more friendly than a holiday inn or embassy suites staff. I am low maintance and dont usually need much help from staff or concierge. I wasn't greeted by any staff throughout the stay, not even bell man. I asked at check-out if she could arrange for a cab to pick me up, and she hesitated to help me. She told me taxis are driving by non stop so It's easy to get a cab. I had issues with my room at check-in, and the employee told me to stop by tomorrow and the manager could put me on higher floor (I didnt really care what floor I was on). The staff at the Boca bar was really nice, epecially the bartenders. Room: B Overall the room was nice, but not nice enough for what I paid. Since I paid extra to upgrade, I expected a little nicer view or slightly larger room. My bathroom didn't have the cool bath tubs (with water from ceiling), the view was not great from 7th floor. The view from my window was an empty office building and a bunch of heating and ac vents. My bathroom didnt even have an enclosed shower or toilet. My bathroom had a gross shower curtain, it seemed odd. I could barely fit in it it was so small. The floor to ceiling windows were really nice. The beds werent really soft. The room overall (except the shower curtain) was very clean, otherwise I would rate this room lower. Location: b+ The hotel is within a short walking distance of everywhere you need to go downtown. The hotel is located right next to a 24-7 porn shop called taboo. It seemed out of place. The other downtown hotels look slightly closer to the shopping areas. The hotel has a star bucks across the street which was nice. Spa/pool: no review Restaurant: I didnt eat at the restaurant or order room service. The bar was nice and the staff was friendly here. Other issues: I requested a different room when I checked in, hoping for a different bathroom or better view. Again, I only made this request because I paid more to upgrade (but it didn seem like I had an upgraded room). So I went from 7th floor to 10th floor to a different room. The room looked like a dungeon with no view in corner of building. I ended up going back to my original room. Overall value: C+ Overall, for the price I paid I wish I would have stayed somewhere else. The only positives were champagne at check-in, panoramic windows, free wifi and an easy walk to shopping and market. I could have stayed at the 4 seasons or another nice hotel for this price range. Nothing stood out for me, and I have no idea how others claimed to have exceptional customer service. The management needs to take a look at improving its customer service. Before I checked in I attempted to contact the hotel twice, with no response to my voice mails. I told them at check-in it was strange, but the staff shrugged it off.

My inner critic did not make a peep during my stay at the Hotel 1000. I know everyone has different expectations and needs when they travel so I'll try to be as detailed about my my experience as possible. First off, I live in Seattle. I wasn't just looking for a comfortable place to sleep. I was looking for a beautiful place to sleep in. I was lucky enough to stay in a deluxe room which had a bathroom with a walk-in shower, a jet tub and a glass wall that looked out into the bedroom. For privacy there was a remote controlled curtain. The rest of the room was laid out in a such way that didn't feel overcrowded or empty (keep in mind though I'm 5'2\" and 112lbs). I loved the heavy double layer curtains that helped more with my sleeping in objective. The colors, and decor were modern but also inviting. I love walking so for me the hotel was perfectly located. If you don't like hills then Seattle may not be a city for you or you may want to consider renting a car -however valet is expensive just like every other hotel in any other city. The Hotel is on on the same street as Pioneer Square and the Pike Place Market but you have to walk 5-6 blocks up or down a slight hill depending on which direction you're going. It's about 3 blocks from the waterfront and a good 15min walk to the center of downtown where most of the bigger name clothing stores are. It has a medium size gym, a small spa, and a restaurant with great happy hour. But all of this sort of pales in comparison to the service. It's on point without being stuffy. They appreciate that you're there -and I never felt anyone make me feel like it should have been the other way around, even though I really did appreciate being there too.

They must've turned back the pressure, because the splashing when filling the tub was minimal, and they've also included small bottles of bath gel so that you don't have to get it out of the larger dispensers in the shower. The rubber duckie was a fun touch. The lighting in the rooms is superb, with most of the lights on dimmer switches. The bedding was some of the best I've encountered. We walked all over downtown Seattle, and I don't think there could have been a better location, roughly halfway between the Market and Pioneer Square. If you're driving or renting a car, be prepared, there is little overnight parking available in the area, and we ended up having to use the valet a couple of evenings when returning after many of the garages had locked up for the night (6:30pm). The valet is quick and professional, but at $40 plus tip, it's more than I'd like to spend. On the nights that we did make it into other garages, (didn't utilize valet), it cost $20 overnight.

Really. I liked the layout, the design, the beds, the bathrooms etc. While I was not as enraptured with the tub that filled from the ceiling as most seem to be (for one thing it splatters water like crazy) the tub itself was probably one of the most comfortable I've ever experienced in a hotel. Usually they are either too big or too small ( or too gross) to bathe comfortably, but this was the Goldilocks Tub, just right in terms of size. The beds were extremely comfortable and the room had everything you could ask for and more, including robes that I didn't feel squeamish putting on. We tried out the spa, and it was excellent and we had two very nice massages though the prices are a bit steep (perhaps that is the usual for Seattle but it was more than a third above what we are used to paying...I can't really compare prices due to being unfamiliar with Seattle's base price but we've had massages in almost every geographic region of the US and these were definitely among the most expensive). However, the spa was very nice. The gym was adequately equipped. The location was excellent, in easy walking distance to several local attractions and the staff was universally friendly, helpful and pleasant and we had no problems whatsoever with any of the amenities features or room service. I am dinging this hotel a single star for one specific reason, that is possibly not an issue for the weekend traveler, and I have recently decided that I am going to ding every hotel we stay at that does not provide this service: a guest operated laundry facility. When we travel, we travel for extended periods of time and we don't like to stay at flea bag hotels which appear to be the only ones that offer coin-operated laundry services any more. The upper end hotels (and even the mid-range hotels) now rely on severely over-priced laundry services that are completely ridiculous. We arrived at Hotel 1000 and we had about ten days worth of laundry to do and still a week left on our vacation--a major laundering was needed. Hotel 1000 charges $9.00 for a pair of pants to be laundered. I priced out having my laundry sent out to be cleaned and realized that the total to do my laundry would have been about $250 and that's if I sink washed socks and underclothes! If they offered a coin-operated laundry unit, I could have washed the same clothes in roughly two loads for less than $20. I found this completely ridiculous. I don't believe the extended traveler should be gouged on laundry, nor should they have to schlepp their dirty clothes to a laundromat (in this case the closest one was 2 miles away) and I don't believe it's entirely beyond the realm of space considerations to place a coin-operated laundry facility on hotel premises.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara, California", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best.\u201d", "Author": "Bill33045", "ReviewID": "UR118511680", "Content": "This is our 4th stay at this hotel.

We also have a tendency to enjoy a rather hip but cushy sort of hotel, and since Hotel 1000 came up as a Favourite, we went for it. The rooms were perfect, the decor modern but not so much that it was minimalist or not user-friendly. I particularly liked the television feature of being able to sit back, relax and watch a stunning slideshow of photographs from around the world while listening to music. The Staff were incredibly helpful with suggestions (restaurants, sights, etc) and they were appreciative of our car-less status. The Concierge was quick to get us a taxi if need be, or show us walking directions on the map. And honestly, you really can do downtown Seattle some justice without the expense of a rental car. I also particularly loved the Bathroom amenities and the Molton Brown Toiletries. This was a Bath Lovers Paradise! The tub was enormous (big enough for two, if you like) and separate from the shower which was located on the opposite side of the bathroom. The tub also fills from a spout located in the ceiling which looks pretty neat, but takes away from the peaceful \u201cOh let me just warm this bath up a bit\u201d option. It should also be noted that there is no privacy unless you roll down the Blind as the bathroom wall connected to the living room is actually a window and not a wall at all.

Quick, easy, courteous and streamlined - left me to enjoy my weekend rather than worry about my vehicle, parking, theft, etc. The valet fee was a little hefty above $30, but in the end, I didn't at all mind having to pay for the seamless experience. I was welcomed by luxury and fabulous treatment upon check-in with a glass of sparkling wine. Check-in was easy and I was on my way to my room - which knocked my socks off.

The bartenders were wonderful - funny, charming, knowledgeable, attentive, and most importantly - knew how to mix drinks better than perhaps anyone I've ever met. The prices were as expected for a downtown hotel bar - not outrageous, but, definitely a little pricey. Again, you're downtown...everything is more expensive. Checkout was simple and to top it off, even after we checked out, we were allowed to leave our bags at the desk and leave our car in valet while we went out and enjoyed our day! No hassle! So we went to the marketplace, enjoyed the wine and cheese festival, and came back to pick up our bags and vehicle! FABULOUS, FABULOUS, FABULOUS. I don't know what else I can say about it.

The location is perfect, the rooms are nice and large, there are a restaurant and bar for when you\u2019re hungry and thirsty, and there is even a gym and spa. We used American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts to book the room, and we were upgraded to a larger room, had complimentary breakfast for two each morning, 4:00PM check out, and a $100 voucher to use at the spa. When we checked in, we were treated to glasses of champagne, which was a nice touch. We were also presented a note from the general manager welcoming us to the hotel. The lobby itself isn\u2019t very big, but there is always water in the afternoon and coffee in the morning for guests to enjoy. We were in room 802, which was a corner suite overlooking Madison Street and the back of the hotel. The room was very spacious! Windows wrapped the entire room, so there is a lot of sunlight. Towards the back of the room by the rear windows, there is a long sofa and a comfortable chair. A flat-panel TV is in the same area, and it is on a swivel bracket so you can turn the TV towards the bed if you want to watch shows from there. There is also a large desk in the room that overlooks the street. The closet space is also huge. A mini bar is located in the room, and you can make your own coffee in the morning with coffee grinds and a French press. The bathroom was pretty impressive. There is a separate shower, tub, and toilet. The tub is pretty neat because the water comes from the ceiling. Just remember to close the blinds when you\u2019re taking a bath here because people passing by on the street can definitely look in. There are two very comfortable robes in the room, and all the lotions, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash are Molton Brown. The room has free Wi-Fi, so it was easy and convenient to stay connected. The turndown service is also nice. When they turn down your bed, they leave you with two pieces of chocolate that were very tasty! We had our morning breakfast in Boka, and the food was really good. Everyone raves about the truffle fries, so I requested it as a potato side with my meal. The cook obliged (since it wasn\u2019t on the menu), and it was very good! I also had the croissant French toast that was pretty good. The breakfast meal portions are big, so wake up hungry! The location is great! Pike\u2019s Market is about a 5-minute walk down 1st Avenue and the harbor is a couple of blocks down from the hotel. The only down side about the location is that it\u2019s towards the bottom of a large hill, so if you need to head inland, you have to walk up steep hills. Parking is pretty expensive here at $39 plus tax. But the valet guys are very good and fast. Each time someone got our car, we have two bottles of water with their compliments in the drink holders. We would definitely stay here again. The staff always said hello when we came into the hotel, and the location is really good.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "orange county, CA", "Title": "\u201cTrendy\u201d", "Author": "buonduacon", "ReviewID": "UR105280823", "Content": "Booked Hotel 1000 through Amex Fine Hotels and Resort and automatically upgraded to suite with 2 free breakfast per day stay and $100 voucher for use in Spa.

This hotel was quite a splurge for us, so we expected it to be amazing in every way. At first everything seemed perfect, the valet service was nice, check-in was friendly and we were offered sparkling wine, the room was beautiful, with big windows with a nice view (there are buildings infront of the water, but we expected that) and the bath was wonderful! Upon arrival to our room, we were greeted with a small fruit topped cake with a sign made out of chocolate that said \"happy 10th anniversary\" and our name, along with the wine and chocolates. So far so good. But we didn't see anything about breakfast or the rose petals, and assumed they would be brought later. Eventually they called and said they had our breakfast certificate, which they had forgotten to give us earlier. Well, we never did get our petals, which we were told got delivered to the wrong room. They did compensate for it at check-out by taking a little off our bill. But I have to say, the breakfast was a big dissapointment. We ordered in room service from the order form that you put out on the door at night...there were really only 2 options besides a continental breakfast: Boka breakfast which my husband ordered, and omlette, which I ordered, along with a glass of orange juice each. (I had been looking forward to french toast which I saw online, but it wasn't even on the menu there.) The Boka breakfast was measly and over done: one egg, some bacon, a bit of hashed brown potatoes, and a very flat dry english muffin, slapped very un-presentably on the plate. My omlette was ok, but nothing better than what I've had at far cheaper places! And the cost for that came to $48!!! Well, we were told we \"went over\" on our complimentary breakfast, (which we still had to pay room service fee) and were charged extra! There was no previous explanation of what we were allowed to get, so we assumed it was the 2 main meals offered. I would suggest not bothering with the extra packages.

Thanks to Amex FHR I was upgraded to a suite, which whilst it had no view, was very nice. The room has some nice features, such as an audio cable to plug your mp3 player into the TV. A lot of hotels now provide you the ability to connect your music or laptop to the TV, but never give you the cables, and who carries one with them? There was also an ipod cable so you could connect that or charge it if needed. It's about the only hotel I've stayed in where the HD TV displays everything in the right format. There is some style over substance. The bath that fills from the ceiling may look nice, but in reality it splashes water everywhere, and the water had to be on full to get it hot. It's then almost impossible to top up the bath later on. The hotel is in a great location, a few blocks from the University Street station if you come in via the Light Rail, just head for the 2nd Ave exit. Ordered a continental breakfast on my first day, and all I got was a yoghurt muesli thing. The tray came with jams and butter, but a bit pointless with no pastries or croissants to have them with. Wasn't sure if I'd made a mistake on the card or not, but didn't seem much of a continental breakfast. The breakfast card also wasn't replaced so hard to re-order the next day. I decided on breakfast in the restaurant after that, and one time was seated then ignored, a coffee came with no spoon or sugar, but no issues the other times.

Later that night we wanted to listen to a CD that we had brought but they didn't have a CD player in the room (though they have other inputs, including for iPods as well as the cable). So we asked if they could bring us a CD player and within 5 minutes an engineer was in our room hooking up a DVD player for us! the bed was very comfy but the pillows were a little uncomfortable for me as I'm used to feather pillows.

Very spacious, plus the bathroom was amazing in itself. The whole room is set up for the tech junkie. Forgot your cables? No worries- they have some in the closet. Good thinking! The courtesy car is a great amenity that I took advantage of a couple times ( more on that in a sec). Anyway, it's within walking distance to Pike Market, Seattle Art Museum, and numerous pubs and restaurants. I did walk to the Space Needle one morning, but I reccomend taking a cab or the car if it's available. This is where the hotel staff went above and beyond - while in Seattle I was mugged near the SAM one night. I had to be taken to the hospital, but I was released a few hours later. I called the front desk to have them send a cab for me, but instead they sent the car. It felt like to me that the staff made my welfare a top priority. Even upon arriving home I was met with an email from the hotel making sure that I didnt forget anything, and they even offered help with any police reports regarding my incident. Just for the record, I do not hold the hotel nor the city responsible for the acts of 2 street thugs that I was unfortunate enough to run into.

There no ice machines here, they bag packs of ice and put in a freezer chest for you to grab near the elevator. Everytime we stepped into lobby, we were always greeted with a smile and our name. That is a huge plus in our book. Staff gave great recommendations of local eats. They never gave bad recommendations. Thank you to Run at the front desk for the french crepe place.

Food was awesome, we found ourselves ordering more food because their reverse happy hour was 50% off all urban bites. What a deal that was.

The restaurant manager came out and apologized for the delay and said he would comp our breakfast, which I told him our breakfast was already \"comped\" because of another issue. He seemed like he didn't quite know what to say at that point. I asked him what time check out was because our breakfast took so long and it was already 10:45am, to which he said noon. But, I had a hunch that might not be correct so we got back to the room and I called the front desk and found out that check out was actually 11am! Good thing I called.

What a wonderful experience!!!! We will definitely be coming back to stay! We have nothing but good things to say about the place...and considering we booked the hotel based on other TripAdvisor members' comments, thought it was important to give credit where credit is due. :) The staff was beyond friendly and helpful. Everyone was great--the doormen out front, the front desk reception, the servers in Studio 1000 (hotel lounge), the concierge, the room service staff, the golf attendant, the spa attendant...everyone had a smile on their face! It was as though they were happy to see us! What a wonderful way to spend the weekend at a hotel! The room itself is beautiful...the tub that fills from the ceiling is truly a sight to see. The sheets are extremely soft and the robes are nice as well. The bar comes fully stocked with nice wine glasses, drinking glasses and even a wine opener. The television has a few cool features. One of them is an interactive menu with options such as \"Dining,\" \"Personal Music,\" \"Movies,\" etc. It even had our name up on the screen to greet us when we first checked in. Additionally, there are a variety of scenic views to choose from (which is basically a still video of a landscape with relaxing music in the background). We underestimated the power of this as both of us fell asleep to the soothing sounds of the waves and the view of the beach in Mexico! HBO is included in the room and they have a decent selection of pay-per-view movies. We only entered one issue during our stay, but that issue was resolved efficiently so we have no complaints!!! When we first checked into our room, the screen in between the bathroom and the bedroom area didn't work. We told our bellman and someone at the front desk and they said they would have an engineer up to look at it right away. When we came back about an hour later, it still wasn't fixed. We went downstairs and explained that it still wasn't fixed. They immediately gave us the room next door. The Studio 1000 lounge is wonderful. I can't say enough about it. It's a small, intimate setting with delicious food (the grilled cheese and tomato soup is to die for!) and an amazing wait staff! If you can get a seat around the fire, all the better...but the surrounding chairs are comfortable as well. We could not have asked for better service! One quick example...we went downstairs to Studio 1000 looking forward to cozying up next to the fire, ordering a glass of wine and a few appetizers. When we arrived, we were disappointed to find that there were no more seats available in the small space. Immediately, the manager sugegsted an area where we could wait while he rustled up some chairs (from a different location) so we could sit. He came back right away with two comfortable chairs and placed us right up near the fire. Following our drinks and appetizers, he suggested a few seafood restaurants in the area that we might like to try. The following evening when we went back, he remembered both of our names. It's small details like that that truly make one's stay memorable. The location of the hotel is also great. It's very close to Pike Place Market. We took a cab the first day only to realize that we were only a few blocks away. We were able to walk to nearly every restaurant or lounge we visited.

This room was all that was available when I rebooked after changing our trip dates. Even, the basic rooms are lovely and have the fabulous tub. We loved this hotel! We were greeted by name on arrival. We were just a mom and daughter on a vacation together. Everyone new my name even the bellmen and all concierge. We stayed in luxury hotels our entire trip, and this one was our favorite. We were there June 21-23 and June 27-30. The bathtub is great for soaking. Molton Brown products are in dispensers in the shower, and in small personal bottles for the tub, so you have plenty of product during your stay. The towels are great; I asked for extra ones without a problem. The room and bathroom decorations are very nice. The makeup mirror and vanity area are all nice. The cabinet area and garment bag closets were a nice wood with the decor and provided plenty of storage space. An ironing board and iron were provided. A small bar area has wine, Tazo tea, and a French press with Starbucks coffee in a sealed canister. It was resupplied each day. We had planned to stay in another part of Seattle after returning from Canada, before heading home, but we cancelled and rebooked Hotel 1000 to finish out our stay. We were on the 12th and 8th floors. The room was very clean, and I am picky. No dirty glasses as in other reviews. I heard some ambulance and heavy truck street noise on the 8th floor, but it did not ruin a night's sleep. I preferred the 12th. I had heard about street noise in early reviews. We were celebrating my daughter graduating with her Masters from USC, and I wanted her trip to be perfect. These are the things I asked for and was granted without a problem. I requested a high floor away from street noise when first booking the hotel. I was given a complimentary upgrade to a city view to honor our celebration. Both times we stayed, I asked for a AAA discount; I was given it even on the Luxe room. I paid $207 a night. I used the hotel website and reservation line, but I found calling the hotel directly and making my reservation helped prevent some arrival potential problems. The cheif concierge, Joan, helped me get a cake made by the hotel pastry chef in my daughter' s favorite flavors. It was delivered by room service with extra thoughtfulness. They timed the cake arrival for our return after dinner. Joan is very sweet and very professional. The hotel town-car service is a separate business. We had baggage claim pickup at Sea-Tac. The driver Peter was excellent. We appreciated not having to drag our luggage; he took it all even though drivers can no longer park at the curb, but it was a short walk over the skybridge right into his waiting car. It was the only time on the trip other than at the hotel that we had such great service. It was $80.00 for baggage pickup, including tip. 70.00 for the return to the airport. He took a route that avoided traffic, so it was really worth it. He had a sign with my name, and he notified the hotel that we were arriving. Our room was ready when we went to the front desk. A pre-arrival form is sent three days before arrival, if you provide your email address with your reservation. I put in our arrival time and any special requests on this form. I think it makes a difference in letting the hotel know when your arriving. We arrived early, but I asked for them to hold our bags since we were arriving about 2 pm, but we didn't have to wait. The phone and television were what I expected from the hotel web site. Both tv and phone displayed my name, and the tv was playing art scenes when we walked in; I had asked about the art museum at the front desk upon check-in. Long distance and local calls are free with the internet phone system. Upon calling guest service, I received prompt help with extra towels, information, and room service. The fresh berries and Devonshire cream were wonderful. It was berry season, so they were extra fresh. All the room service food was very good. We had no problems using the electronic make-up room or privacy signs. No-one entered the room as noted in some other reviews. A cleaning person did leave a Red-Bull out of the bar. I took it with me when I checked out to show that I had not consumed it. The smart mini-fridge does tell them if anything is missing. They took it off my bill immediately without a problem. One problem, I ran into was gypsy taxis and towncars in Seattle. Orange and green taxis do not have meters and are not legally suppose to stop when flagged, but even if you are flagging yellow cab they try to stop. One driver tried to scam me, but I had enough taxi savy to not fall for it. At the hotel, for our return to the airport, I tried to book our driver directly. It turns out a gypsy company has adopted the name of a family company that has been in business 12 years. They took off a \"d\" from the end of the name. The good company is Advanced Limosine. I got suspicious from a couple of comments made when I was confirming my reservation. I asked the hotel concierge to confirm by reservation with Peter. She did. Peter arrived promptly. But, a gypsy town car service arrived as well. The driver made a big scene outside. The concierge came to worn me what was happening. The bell man, our driver, and even the hotel management came out to protect us from this driver who had pretended to me that he was sending Peter, who had picked us up at the airport, to to return us to the airport. We saw this happen at the Amtrack station on our return from Canada, as well. A gypsy limosine driver was trying to pick-up new arrivals. From now on, I will let the hotel make our transportation arrangements. But for those that prefer to do their own booking, the company is separate from the hotel, so you can ask the hotel for the town car service that they work with and make your travel arrangements directly with them. The hotel will still allow you to add the transportation to your room bill.

Room service prices are inaccurate, while it is not listed anywhere in the menu book they add large service charges and delivery fees. Not unusual but notice is a good thing. 8.

He was in Seattle for work, and I tagged along to hang out and explore the city. I also brought a day or two of work with me. I was looking forward to seeing the hotel because I heard that David Beckham stayed there a few months ago. We were upgraded to a huge suite, so of course I was able to fantasize that maybe I was sleeping in the SAME BED that David Beckham once slept in! Me, my husband, and the aura of David Beckham, all in that big comfy bed. The bedroom was bigger than our bedroom at home; the bathroom was bigger than our bathroom at home; and the living room was bigger than our living room at home. We even had a dining table that was - you guessed it - bigger than our dining table at home. There were two flat screen TVs, including one in the bedroom, and my husband looooved that. The furnishings were comfortable and I loved the Molten Brown toiletries. I took a couple baths in the neat-o tub and I enjoyed the separate shower with two showerheads. Local and long distance calls were free, and there was free internet access in the living room (either through Wi Fi or a cable that they provide to connect your laptop to the jack in the wall). My only complaint was that the Wi Fi stopped working 3 days into our stay, and the cable was very short. So to use my computer, I had to either sit in an armchair with the laptop balanced on the arm, or sit on the floor with the laptop on the very low coffee table. This was uncomfortable and my legs would cramp up very quickly. The workspace options should be better thought out; I would have loved it if the cable had reached the dining table so that I could have worked there. The location of the hotel is terrific. Just a short stroll to Pike Place Market in one direction, and a short stroll to Pioneer Square in the other. The front desk service was excellent, but I had a few negative experiences with housekeeping. For example, they did not really clean the shower stall. I have thick hair and it was disgusting to watch the hair collect on the drain cover. I know I could have easily cleaned it myself, but I wanted to see how long it would be before they actually cleaned the shower. After a couple more days I had to clean it myself because the water would no longer drain. This was gross, but I consoled myself with the thought that maybe some of David Beckham's hairs were still in the shower, too. On another day, I was in the room working and I had the \"Do Not Disturb\" light on. Suddenly the door opened and a housecleaner came into the room. She didn't knock or announce herself at all. She seemed genuinely surprised to see me, but not as surprised as I was. I asked her why she came in when the \"Do Not Disturb\" light was on, and she said it was because she thought we had checked out that day. I said,\"'Even if you thought we had checked out, when you saw the 'Do Not Disturb' light on, why didn't you knock or announce yourself?\" She just apologized repeatedly and left. So that did not make me feel great about hotel security. What if she had come in while I was taking a bath, or in bed with the aura of David Beckham? Thank heaven I was just working. A couple other notes: The gym in the basement is small, but I liked that it was stocked with towels and bottled water. The free strawberry lemonade in the lobby is really tasty and my husband had a glass every day. Our room was huge, but very dark. If natural light is important to you, ask for a room with larger or more windows.

That being said, I do try to find the best deal possible, and have been lucky enough to have stayed in some gorgeous rooms at great prices over the years. Hotel 1000, though, tops the list. My husband and I were heading down to Seattle for a concert and wanted someplace chic, comfortable and close to the venue. After reading Hotel 1000's reviews, there was no question as to where we'd be staying. We booked their most basic room for $225/night, which turned out to anything but basic. The bathroom was incredibly large, with a shower, 2-person ceiling-filled tub, and wonderful amenities, including a loofah sponge. The room itself was massive (we were in a corner room, slightly larger than the regular basic rooms, I believe), with an incredibly comfortable bed. Turndown service left little chocolates on the pillow, we very much enjoyed the French press-brewed Starbucks coffee, and the robes were simply sumptuous. Free wifi and VOIP calls are a nice touch and would make this a perfect place for an extended business stay. Beyond the room, the hotel itself is very nice - intimate and very stylish. There's delicious complementary strawberry lemonade in the lobby, a treat almost as sweet as the staff.

We had a corner room on the 12th floor. The view swept from Mount Rainer & the Stadiums, around to the Sound and Bainbridge Island. It was gorgeous. We were fortunate as the weather was in the low 80's and there wasn't a cloud in the sky. So the city was incredibly gorgeous around the hotel. When we arrived the valet was prompt and polite in taking care of us. We went to check in at 4 and they were doing a final run through on our room. We waited no more than 5 minutes, and our keys were issued. I discovered the heavenly fresh strawberry lemonade in the lobby as I waited! What a treat! Good stuff. When we arrived in our room, it had the fragrance of cleanliness. As if they had spritzed lysol to give it some freshness. It was nice. We of course were taken back by the beautiful views first. Then pleasantly surprised by the size of the room. There was a nice seating area at the end of the room that we weren't expecting. The linens on the bed were heavenly. So soft, almost as smooth as satin. The bed was comfortable, but it wasn't the most steady. It was unusually bouncy. I felt every turn from my husband as he slept. But it wasn't that bad. I'm just used to my Beauty Rest at home and the Westin Heavenly bed (Which is the same mattress.) Hotel 1000 has better sheets...I guess you can't have it all. The bathroom was huge. And I loved the full sized soaps, lotions & hair products throughout. I didn't have time to bathe but the tub was cool. If the weather wasn't so nice, I might have been indoors more and enjoyed a bath. But we were on the go and barely there. I liked the rain shower, but it's mounted on the wall which I found odd. I'm used to it being mounted over head and cascading down. All the fixtures are Kohler and very high end. Even the toilet is high end. Be mindful that if you stay here, there are certain \"givens.\" The sounds of the city can be heard from your room (honking, music, boat horns...the general hustle and bussle of a downtown city). It didn't bother me on the 12th floor much. But my husband's mom was on the 8th floor and found it distracting. Also, getting around town is often difficult. There are many one way streets and going a mile can take a lot longer than expected. But it goes with the territory so it didn't bother me. We took the ferry over to bainbridge island. I recommend the trip. You catch the ferry a few blocks from the hotel. I think it was $12 for the car and driver and $6 for additional passengers. The boat was fun. And the island was beautiful. Cherry blosoms were in bloom too. It's much like the east coast...Nantucket feel. We came back on the 7:10 boat and had a gorgeous sunset cruise. So amazing! Took a day trip to Canada too. Got lucky and the boarder lines were short. We waited no more than 10 minutes on either side. The drive to Victoria was about 2 1/2 hours each way. For those of you who are from big cities...be prepared. The Northwestern Crowd drive the speed limit. I CA we go 70-80 on a regular basis...they go 50-60! Plan on being patient. Very impressive hotel, and fantastic location. I forgot to mention only a mile from Qwest and Safeco field. We drove to the stadum to see the Mariners/Angels game. But you could have walked. Parking was $20. Oh, and our last day there we woke up to tradiatinal Seattle weather. Gloomy, drizzling and cold. Sadly, you couldn't see Mt. Rainer or the island.

The hotel restaurant, BOKA is a wise choice for happy hour (with tapas-style \"urban bites\" for half price as well as the drinks). A golf club with two golf simulator bays is in the lower level of the hotel along with their fitness center and spaaaah (as they call it). Plan to check out the golf simulator during happy hours weekdays for 1/2 price golf and drinks, almost feels like your on the course. The staff is unbelievable, service is efficient and professional, the only delay in any service is getting your car from the hotel valet (as they have to park it off-site).

We booked one of their bigger suites with 2 flat screen TVs, luxury bath, etc. While the staff was quite friendly and the concierge helpful, my problems were with the lack of basic amenities and cleanliness of the bathrooms. My first morning at the hotel, I entered the granite shower with 2 showerheads trying to figure out how to turn the 2 faucets on without getting soaked in cold water, for the knobs were at the far end of the shower and there was no way of avoiding the spray. That was the least of my problems because after I recovered from the ice bath, followed by the scorching heat of the hard-to-adjust temperature setting I realized that there is absolutely no water pressure. There was barely any water trickling out of the shower heads which made it impossible to rinse. Second shock? While fiddling with the temperature knob, I pulled off a wad of someone\u2019s hair on my hand. Minutes later I noticed more foreign hair on the shower walls, Gross! After 10 minutes of trying to rinse unsuccessfully, I decided to just rinse my hair in the sink (which became my daily routine for the next 5 days). There is absolutely no water pressure at all. The next day, I decided to give the soaking tub a try. My first attempt to fill the tub, produced a tub full of dirty sudsy water- apparently they never rinsed it off from the previous guest, so I set out to clean the tub myself. On my 3rd attempt to fill the tub, I noticed that my bath bubbles were gray and dirty. My next grievance is that for such a large bathroom, they give you only one tiny piece of soap (the size of a silver dollar), which you have to carry from the shower, to the sink, to the tub. After 6 days at this hotel, it was never refilled with a new one. While I admire the city\u2019s commitment to conserving water, a functioning shower and a bar of soap are a must for a decent hotel.", "Date": "March 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, OH", "Title": "\u201cWorth the Money\u201d", "Author": "Luv2travel087", "ReviewID": "UR14070189", "Content": "My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel 1000 for three nights and it was definitely an experience to remember!

It is somewhat dark inside and decorated with darker hues, but in a way that is very calming. The rooms are absolutely unbelievable. We had a king waterview and though we paid a little more for the view, the windows were huge and gave us a great view of the Sound.

I called the front desk and they said housekeeping would be up shortly but they were busy. 25 min go by and no coffee. we call again and they assured us someone would be by. 10 min later housekeeping comes by and removes the pot and slides the others around (decaf and hot water) and leaves to refill the regular coffee pot. (I assumed). 20 min later we call back down to complain no coffee. finally housekeeping comes and says she had replaced it earlier when she was in. in fact, what she did was switch the decaf label and the regular label so that the full pot of decaf now said regular. i know this to be true as i was sitting in a chair and watching who came and went the whole time. A new pot was never brought in and if it had, I would have been the first to jump for it after waiting so long. I could have made coffee in the room but I am not a fan of the french press and that is what they offered. The final complaint is that housekeeping came to make up the sleeper sofa at 6:30 and I asked if they could come back as were relaxing in the room ( just checked in) and were sitting on the sofa watching t.v. I felt rushed as she said they were their until 8:00 so i told her to come back at 7:30 and we hurried to get out the door for dinner. i have stayed at the inn at the market and prefer that. they have a wonderful rooftop overlooking the water.

When we got back to the room the first night, we tried to watch a movie, but neither the remote control nor keyboard were working for the TV, so we couldn't get internet or TV. We called the front desk and they sent someone up, but he couldn't fix it. We asked them to fix it during the day while we were out the next day. When we returned to our room at the end of the night the next night, we had a really nice tray of truffles and chocolate covered strawberries with both still and bubbly water. We aren't sure to this day if it was for the broken TV or for my birthday. They didn't say. But it was a nice touch either way. Nonetheless, the TV still wasn't working properly nor was the internet, and we couldn't watch a movie again. And the screen on the phone (which is like a mini computer screen) was supposed to automatically dim at around 9pm, but it didn't and it was so bright lighting up the whole room, we had to cover it with towels and a pillow. Also, there was a light bulb burnt out in one of the closets, and it is so dark in these rooms that we couldn't see what we had in there. They didn't replace that either and so we swapped the bulb from one closet to the other, but then the light wouldn't go out when we closed the door. That was probably why it burnt out in the first place. Also, our desk lamp was broken and just hanging off it's base...I was surprised they'd let it just hang like that and not fix it before occupying the room. The final thing was that the lounge wasn't open at all, so we couldn't sit in our hotel and have cocktails which was too bad. I handed a list of broken things to the front desk person when I checked out, and he just said sorry, and didn't offer up any sort of rebate or consolation for the shortcomings. I followed up when I got home with an email to the manager who'd left us the truffles, and he never replied to my email. I actually had to phone him a month later to ask him if he'd gotten my email, and he said sorry but he'd forgotten about it. He didn't offer and sort of consideration either. So although I love the hotel and the price point, I felt they could have given us a bit more consideration with either attempting to fix the broken TV/console/remote, or giving us another room, or some sort of discount on the room, or a discount on a future stay would've been fine too.

Couldn't figure out how to make the Starbucks coffee in some funky pot - did it all wrong and then realized there were written instructions right next to the pot. Location a little strange (downtown financial district next to an erotica shop) but within walking distance to the lively Pike Place Market. Would definitely return.", "Date": "April 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, wa", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding service, fabulous restaurant and golf!\u201d", "Author": "rainbow_jenny", "ReviewID": "UR7252129", "Content": "Although I have not stayed at Hotel 1000, I feel compel to share my experience as a local Seattleite on its restaurant Boka, the Golf Club, and the amazing service from the staff. I planned a surprise evening for my husband on our wedding anniversary, beginning with a 9 hole round of \"virtual golf,\", then dinner at Boka in Hotel 1000. The Golf Club downstairs offers some 50 courses around the world on high tech screen, with both men and women golf clubs available for use. We arrived 20 minutes late for our tee time and had to wait another 20 minutes before the \"pro\" arrived. However, the staff members were very courteous and apologetic. We were given complimentary drinks while waiting . We thoroughly enjoyed playing the front 9 hole of Mauna Kea while the staff checked in on us regularly to see how we were doing. They even coordinated with Boka Restaurant to hold our reservation since we were running behind schedule. Boka is one of THE best restaurant in Seattle with FABULOUS food, served in very modern decor and chic ambiance . Every staff member along the way congratulated us on our anniversary and made the evening so incredibly memorable. The staff members at Hotel 1000 have converted us into loyal fans, and we look forward to many more dining/golfing trips and stays there.", "Date": "March 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cI'm not a fan\u201d", "Author": "JMillarLosAngeles", "ReviewID": "UR7228046", "Content": "To paraphrase another hotel's marketing motto \"I'm not a fan\". The stay started out wrong with a cold and unpleasant reception. When I gently pointed out that my reservation was for a king and not two queens, reception said \"I'll see what I can do, but it will cost you $50 more.\" How gracious. Miss Congeniality went on to warn me that, because of the hotel's sophisticated technology, if I didn't return my room key I'd be charged $20. Room and hotel was comfortable; no question. Pleasing earth tones in hallways and rooms, and plenty of ambient light from all the gizmos blinking in the rooms. Sophisticated did not translate into operative as I found out when I tried to turn on the television. Great picture; no sound. A call downstairs was unhelpful..\"Just turn it on and off a couple times.\" I did. Silence. I gave up. On check out (gave the key back), I mentioned the TV issue and was told \"Oh, yeah, that's been happening a lot\". Work out the kinks, remind personnel it's all about the guests and I'll think about giving it another try.", "Date": "March 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Wonderful!\u201d", "Author": "Kimmmie", "ReviewID": "UR6548497", "Content": "This hotel is truly wonderful--from the service to the rooms, our stay was simply exquisite.

Hotel1000 is truly modern--and of course, our favorite thing being the bathroom that is separated by a huge glass wall. The option of an automatic screen sliding down for privacy if sharing with a friend. My boyfriend absolutely loved the water that filled the tub from the ceiling! The rooms are smaller than a lot of hotel rooms we've stayed at, but was worth every penny. Every amenity was met, from the plasma, internet service, robes, linens as well as the cute bar downstairs--it made our stay in Seattle a wonderful one!
