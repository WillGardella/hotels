It was also a spectacular value for the price, since we used a Groupon. The dining area has a fabulous blown glass light fixture, breakfast was included in our stay and you order off a menu. The rooms are well-appointed and the bedding is luxurious. We slept peacefully in our comfy beds. All the furnishings look new and the modern styling is fabulous. The only negative on the rooms is that they are a bit narrow, the space from the end of the bed to the dresser should be at least a few inches wider. Also the rooftop pool could use a little updating, it feels a bit sterile with no ambiance, and to me it did not feel inviting. There was an adjacent workout room which neither myself nor my husband used. The staff here was very courteous and friendly. Since the hotel is a few blocks off the strip, they shuttled us to the strip whenever we wanted and picked us up when we called -- very nice. The ground floor of the hotel is a parking garage which is gated and closes/locks after each car enters (room key opens). The neighborhood in which the hotel is situated is a bit \"iffy\", I didn't know what to think of it, but it wasn't a problem.

Yes, I did have my \"do not disturb\" sign (which I had to take from another door because I didn't have one), but as I left the room at 11:30am and waved at the housekeeper who was cleaning the room down the hall, thinking this would be enough of a notice that I have left the room (removing the DND from the door before leaving) to return at 6 pm to a non-cleaned room! Calling the housekeeping ended up ringing the front desk where I asked for more TP since there was one pull on the first roll when I arrived and was down to about 4 pulls on the second and since I missed out on service for the day...the 'lead housekeeping' man arrived to deliver the TP and was very apologetic as he delivered the TP (that I called for 2 hrs earlier) to the wrong room. ...so the next day when I left the room at 11:30am and noticed no housekeeping staff on my floor, I called down to the front desk to ask and make sure I got housekeeping because I didn't get any the night before. I was assured no problem..returning at 6 pm...no housekeeping!! Now I was pissed...and once again the lead shows up so I ask for towels, shampoo, coffee and the dude that shows upmsplies me with two of everything..until I check the towels which ended up being two bath mats, hand towels and face cloths...before I could call down there was a knock and it was the dude with a towel (one, not two and it looked like it had been dragged behind a bus)! No problems, I thanked him and he was on his way. I thought \"at least it was clean\". But other then that, I was quite happy with the room. I got one on the back side so I never heard alarms or sirens and only the odd airplane fly over (due to the fact that the a/c was on and it was rather loud).

The corner cutting manifests itself in a variety of ways: lack of updating in the rooms; very limited amenities; and \u2013 worst of all \u2013 \u201cresort fees\u201d that seem ubiquitous these days. So, amid all these cutbacks and corner-cutting, this Holiday Inn is a breath of fresh air. Yes, it is a chain, and yes, it is not on the Strip or Downtown, but I would consider that a bonus. This hidden, anonymous hotel next to Terrible\u2019s and near Hard Rock offers great rooms at a great price. This hotel gets the little things right. First off, the hotel is new: just two years old, according to the desk clerk. So the rooms are modern, well-appointed, and clean. The shower was especially nice: a large shower-only set up (who the heck takes a bath in a Vegas hotel?) with great water pressure. The sink area was large and pleasant. Same with the room itself. The king bed was comfortable, with good linens. There is a flat-panel television with lots of channels. No fridge or safe deposit box: this hotel is more of a business hotel than anything else. The d\u00e9cor was modern. Very pleasant overall. It was very quiet, with almost no noise seeping in. FREE parking (underground) and FREE Internet and FREE use of fitness facility: the last two items are where many hotels now gouge you. (If you can't park free in Vegas, you are doing something wrong.) In addition, the desk staff was friendly, and check in smooth. The price were unreal. I booked this on Priceline, not knowing what I would get, and it turned out to be a great bargain: $45 for a Saturday night and - wait for it - $24 for a Monday night.

Bed stand wood corners protrude out at ankle level, ouch! Firm mattress, but the pillows are very lumpy and too soft, even the ones marked FIRM. This is a Holiday Inn trademark at every property. Lot's of bad spill stains from previous guests on carpet that could not be cleaned. Very unforgiving carpet choice. Free underground parking was a bonus in the Nevada desert heat! Caution! Stalls are very narrow, with lots of pillars, drive slowly. Lone window has no sheer drapes to filter light through while allowing privacy from outside. Only option is to close pull down blind, blocking all natural light. Two elevators for seven floors are very slow, so make sure you are patient. Avoid rooms overlooking the pool area due to excessive noise from guests, music speakers, and the busy fire department right across the street. They had eight emergency calls on our first night, with sirens going off hourly until 410am!! We listened to poolside guest normal conversations until after 10pm, outdoor music until midnight when I finally had to call the front desk to turn off the pool speakers. We moved to the otherside of hotel with no view for quiet. No, breakfast is NOT automatically included. It depends on your room rate package, if it includes breakfast, so make sure you choose the rate plan that offers breakfast and one beverage choice. Limited menu from 0630-11am. No buffet, set menu only. Wait staff seemed rushed, overwhelmed, dirty coffee cups and utensils from previous diners stayed on our table the entire time. The check was placed on the table with our meals, and the server never returned. I recommend getting a Terrible's Casino FREE BUFFET coupon from the lobby tourist rack. Terrible's Casino is right across the street, with a good buffet restaurant. On coupon is another coupon for a FREE Cap or T-Shirt and $5 slot free play when you open a free players club card. You will need the card to redeem the buffet coupon. We collected our free t-shirts, used the $5 slot free play after you add at least a dollar to the machine with your card. Cheap fun at Terrible's! Breakfast buffet is $3.99, lunch $5.99, dinner and sunday brunch only $8.99. Use the coupon for 2-4-1 buffets! One guest at the pool bragged that she got the Holiday Inn Las Vegas using Priceline for only $50/night for her entire week stay. Another guest used Hotwire website for a low rate. I used the regular Holiday Inn website for my higher rate (sigh). Also, you get nothing extra as a Gold or Platinum level Priority Club member. I am a Platinum level member and was \"pre-assigned\" to a small room 321, next to the ice machine and elevators, with a view of a wall, the loud pool music speaker and directly down at the busy hot tub, listening to guest conversations all day.

We arrived after 10pm so no free shuttle from airport. Taxi was about $15 with tip. Check-in with Jeff was easy. He changed our room from a king to two queens. There is no advantage being a Priority club member as there are no upgrades because there are only two types of rooms. The website mentioned executive floor but nothing such exists according to one of the front desk guys. We had breakfast included-not a $10 voucher as advertised but a coupon for an entr\u00e9e and one drink (juice or coffee but not both). Room was ok with view towards vacant lot so quiet. A/C worked well, nice tv with limited channels. Comfortable chair with lamp in corner. Light bulb replaced in lamp between beds as requested. Bathroom nice with low tub-easy to step out of. Toilet didn\u2019t always flush on first try. Shampoo, cream, soap provided and ok. Plenty of towels. Shuttle was ok and usually available but only to preset locations. We would take to strip and then wander back on foot. Usually stopped at Tuscany on the way back. Terribles nearby but very smoky because of poor ventilation. I won\u2019t return there again unless staying within area. No complaints with front desk staff. For breakfast, try to get lady. One older man seemed bothered to serve and took 3 requests to get ice water. One younger guy was ok but lady was the best. We didn\u2019t use the pool or exercise room but did print out boarding passes for our return flight. They stored our luggage since our flight wasn\u2019t until 5 pm. Great shuttle ride to airport. Biggest scare was waking up at 3 am with no electricity. It was dark since there was no emergency lighting in room. Phone didn\u2019t work so I used cell phone to call front desk (fortunately, I had called when we were to arrive late so number was still in recent call list) Nice lady said whole block was out but not sure why. I was a little concerned because who would notify us if we had to escape. No lights so there would be lots of people in underwear or less evacuating! After about 45 minutes, electricity came back on so just a false alarm. One strong recommendation: The Envy Steakhouse at the Renaissance for Sunday brunch. $29.95 includes bloody Mary station, wines, and French champagne plus omelettes and other breakfast selections, prime rib, shrimp, oysters on half shell, split crab legs, cheeses, desserts, and more. A Liberace type piano player with several older women made even more special. Have the shuttle take you to the convention center and walk back. We took the shuttle to the Venetian and walked and walked but found it and had the best Sunday brunch ever. A definite must do on the next trip. I would probably not stay here again unless I got a great rate or couldn\u2019t get one elsewhere. Most staff were nice, hotel was clean, but location was not the best.

While traveling on business February 21st, air traffic was disrupted by a large snowstorm that blanketed the upper Midwest, causing flight delays and cancellations and rerouting hundreds if not thousands of travelers. I was one of those unfortunate people who were caught in the middle, dealing with long lines, cranky people and unusual circumstances as I tried to get from Minneapolis to Salt Lake City. After seventeen hours and several changes in my itinerary, the closest I could get to my destination was by making my first-ever trip to Las Vegas, arriving after midnight and leaving early the next day to get to Salt Lake City - late for my business meeting. I caught a cab at the Las Vegas airport, and the driver attempted to find his way to the Holiday Inn on Palos Verdes - he didn't have much luck, and actually called the dispatcher and the hotel for directions before finally finding it just after 1:00 am on the 22nd. I was exhausted by my seemingly endless day of travel, had no luggage, and just wanted to get a nap before starting over again in a few hours. I paid the cab driver too much money and entered the hotel lobby. The desk clerk, Donald, alerted of my arrival by the can driver's call, was ready for me. He was warm and friendly as he greeted me, happily provided toiletries to get me through until my luggage could find me, offered information about the return trip to the airport, and took my wake-up call request, all very efficiently and in a manner that I was grateful for after a trying day. I was in my room by 1:15. A few hours later, my 5:00 am wake up call was prompt, and Donald was still cheerful and helpful. At my request, he called a cab company that took credit cards, offered me a cup of coffee, and chatted with me while I waited for my cab to arrive. As I got in the cab, he thanked me for my business, and wished me luck on my travels. While the trip was ultimately a successful one, it had started by going form bad to worse - until your desk clerk changed my attitude by presenting his own positive attitude and cheerful outlook. I would like to take this opportunity to let you know I appreciated the hospitality, and would like you to pass this \"thank you\" on to Donald for helping me make a bad day better. I have not maximized my stays at Holiday Inns in the past, instead I have stayed in higher-end properties with stuffy, unfriendly employees much too often.

He got up to run to get his phone, ran into the wood corner of the bed which tripped him. He fell and suffered a rug burn on his knee and a bruised shin. That's when the trash can \"guards\" went up. Housekeeping would move the trash cans when they cleaned and bam! we would run into the corners again. Ouch! It's the bright white comforter over the dark wood frame.

We walked from the hotel to the strip about 11pm and we were relatively safe. I didn't get stabbed, shot or assaulted even once while I was there! All kidding aside, overall I think this hotel is not a bad option for some folks. The hotel itself is pretty nice, modern and clean. I found the beds comfortable and any noise from the airport is no big deal, it did not slow me down from sleeping. The staff were very friendly and accomodating...with a very easy check-in. Staying on the strip, the check-in can sometimes take 40 minutes. I was checked-in under 5 minutes.The parking garage is right underneath the hotel and was very convenient. If you have a car or rental car, it is not a bad choice...especially if in town for business. You avoid all the hassles of the crowds on the strip yet you are only 1 mile from there. You can walk or take a taxi, taxi ride for those looking to indulge in some beverages and not drive will run about $8-9 to go straight over flamingo to the bill's gambling hall taxi which is the closest spot to get out on the strip. Now, if you like to just go downstairs from your room and gamble or walk the strip, you will not like it. Although, \"Terrible's\" Casino is right across the street. The restaurant in there is pretty cheap and it is an acceptable place to make a gambling donation...but don't expect much eye candy, hit the Hard Rock for that (about 1/2 mile up Paradise)...OMG, sensory overload. Terrible's is your basic hangout for locals or those who are on there last nickel. But back to the review! I found the restaurant to be good, clean and relatively inexpensive for breakfast, by vegas standards,,,about $8. We even had a nice strip view at night, of course during the day you can see the surrounding neighborhood and it is a little rough. All in all, if you have a car, go for it...you can certainly do worse.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boise, Idaho", "Title": "\u201cAs they say location is everything\u201d", "Author": "BoiseID999", "ReviewID": "UR98384147", "Content": "Very new hotel, underground parking.

The builder, architect, whomever, just really made the wrong choice on window materials+ design. The plane noise during the day is 1 plane taking off approx every 8 minutes. The hotel is close to the airport so the planes are only about 1200 feet above the building; but what exacerbates the noise issue is the way layout of the building makes the worse then it actually is- catching it like a parabolic. This is not an exageration- if 2 people are talking in the room with the TV on- the planes will interrupt like a person snoring in the room. But if you are outside on the street, or in your car, you do not notice the jet noise as much. This may be IChotels worst hotel for that fact. On another note: The jet noise is only during the day, you do not notice it at night. Other than the jets, noise is not a factor & is a peaceful place. Aside from that, the staff is very nice. Cleaning crew good. All other factors- No Problem- Holiday Inn professionalism through out. Rooms look like they were designed by Bob Guccione. If noise isn't an issue, please consider this hotel. It is a great location for business if you are working a convention at LVCC. Personally I put up with the noise because I got a Hotwire deal on this. For the money I paid, it was still worth it noise & all. I would not have been happy paying full rate for this.

Unfortunately the first day fell on Christmas Day and major hotels on the Strip were bit too pricey, so I gambled and booked this Holiday Inn which was about a mile away from the Strip. I've been to Vegas many times but never stayed at a hotel which is off the Strip and didn't know what to expect. Luckily once you pass the Las Vegas Boulevard, it only takes about 2-3 minutes to the hotel. There are many popular restaurants around there, including my new favorite, Firefly. The garage had the gate which made me wonder if the area was not safe or I should be looking around when we unload our luggage but that was the only part that made me feel a tiny bit uneasy and everything else was great. Unlike those Vegas hotels, there was no waiting line to check-in and the young guy at the front desk was very pleasant. The room felt like it was still new and we thought it was a decent size. Oh, but I kept hitting my feet to the bed frame. Overall, everything was clean and new except the bed sheet. When I opened my comforter, it had wrinkles like someone was sleeping on there already. I checked the pillows and they looked clean and didn't smell anything and I was too tired to call the front desk and wait for someone to come and change it so I've decided to ignore it. I went to sleep right away and heard nothing but my sister said many people came back to their rooms after midnight and got pretty loud. She said she thought someone was in our room talking. Next day, I was able to enjoy my favorite TV channel on a big flat TV while my sister was able to check her emails for free. We knew we'd sleep in late until we had to check-out so didn't bother to ask if we get the free breakfast as some of those Vegas websites stated but I think I've read we could get complimentary coffee in the morning at their cafe. We were going to shop whole day so we moved to a hotel on the Strip next day, but when I come to Vegas by myself, I often go to places off the Strip and don't need to stay at those pricey major hotels. Especially, many hotels nowadays have been cutting down many amenities anyways (do you remember we used to get stuff like cotton swabs, shoe polish clothe or mending kit?) but adding ridiculous Resort Fees for nothing (this past year, I've stayed at Mirage, Treasure Island, Venetian and Planet Hollywood which recently stopped charging the Resort Fee). I didn't feel like I downgraded and stayed at a cheap motel. It was nice that there was no awful smell of smoke to go through when you come back to the hotel or stupid Resort fee to pay but got a free internet access with many good dining places to choose from. I'll definitely stay here again (but I will call the front desk if I see wrinkles on my bed sheet next time).", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cUsed hard and worn out fast - management that doesn't care\u201d", "Author": "IndyTravelerX", "ReviewID": "UR91714213", "Content": "Shuttle service runs when it wants to, don't expect a pickup during the posted hours.

The style is clean, modern and simplistic --- nothing extra. The location of the Holiday Inn on Palos Verdes Street is 1 of 3 total near the Vegas strip, and the one most taxis do not know where it is, so be prepared to say your address and give them directions. While the hotel offers a shuttle all day long (5-15 minute waits), it does not do pick-ups, so that extra money you saved by getting a hotel further away from the strip goes to paying for the taxi rides every night. Advice --- better to pay the extra $10-$20/night and get a more convenient hotel closer to the strip. The hotel shuttle drop offs at three major locations: MGM, Venetian and Flamingo, which are all decent places to start walking to your next destination. To walk at night to your hotel is not recommended, even though taxis rates are high compared to New York and Atlanta. The taxis are overall friendly and can recommend several places to go and things to do. I would suggest to the hotel that they offer shuttle pick-ups for certain times 9pm-11pm, it would certainly help as visitors who stay there will be happier with the easier convenience and the hotel could make a bigger name for itself since it is not located on the strip. Or offer cheap $5/flat rate fees for pick-ups, it's really inconvenient compared to other hotels. The hotel is located almost in the middle of nowhere, as of May/June 2010, there is alot of empty concrete ground around the hotel. Close by/walking distance depends on the hot desert air, you can go eat at local restaurants such as Buca Di Beppa and Roy's, none of which I tried. The Holiday Inn has a nice breakfast available at their level floor known as the Forte Grill. They offer a good selection of breakfast meals for a decent price, from omelets to croissants to toast, with self-serve coffee. The service can be slow at time, seems there is only 1 person working and runs around doing all the hotel room services as well. The front desk is next to a open seating area and bar, and behind is a big area for public conferencing or business/computer area. Only 1 computer with USB hub and laser printer is offered, there is a touchscreen that doesn't do anything. I would suggest adding another computer station setup. The hotel is very clean, immaculate is the word, which could either make you love it or hate it. It can seem cold at times, but Holiday Inn is going for the new and hip look, which attracts the under 50 or single visitors in Vegas. Walking around in the morning and evening, you don't see many people, which is nice in a crowded Vegas. It's very quiet, although you are 10 minutes away from the airport. I never heard any bothersome planes from overhead. However, the hotel walls are slightly thin, you can hear the TV from next door at night. The hotel room is very simple looking, ours was a 2 Queen size beds with large cable TV and one small coffee table (with pot & mix), one dresser connected to a long table with a lamp with 2 extra sockets. There's one 1-seat sofa chair and a bedside table with a phone and a lamp inbetween the 2 beds. Overall, I think the beds take up too much space due to the layout, and there could better bright lighting instead of 3 small lamps which you must turn on one by one, and one more sit-in chair/stool would be good. There is a normal-sized closet with an iron and ironing board inside with extra hangers, useful. The bathroom is nicely setup with the basic dryer, towels and accessories, also includes big showerhead nozzle and working vents. The hotel beds are big and soft, which can be good or bad depending on your back. There are 4 large pillows included, 2 firm, 2 soft and a nice bedsheets, although I was allergic to the linen or fabric. Advice --- bring long pajamas. Room service was friendly and quick to answer the phone, however we did ask them to give them to give us a cell phone call when our lost luggage arrived, but they never called. We had to find out later by going to the front desk, however they did leave a message on the phone.

On a small down note, the AC is a little loud.", "Date": "March 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cNewer hotel, not bad\u201d", "Author": "herminator", "ReviewID": "UR58247509", "Content": "I stayed one night before leaving for the airport this past weekend. I stay at alot of Holiday Inns across the country and this is a newer property with some nice features. The rooms are comfortable, bathroom large, flat screen TV and comfortable bed. There is a lounge restaurant on the main floor which I did not use so I cant comment on that. It is a mile off the strip so dont think its close by. Terribles is across the street if you want a near by casino and Hard Rock is a block south. (Blocks in Las Vegas are not standard city blocks, they are much longer) Plenty of restaurants within walking distance and its near the airport. However you are also on a flight pattern so the noise of jets taking off is constant and loud. Also for some reason the shuttle company I purchased a round trip ticket from for the airport will not pick up at this property so I had to meet them across the street at Terribles casino for pickup. Take away the noise of the jets taking off and being a mile off the strip I might stay there again.", "Date": "March 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canadian", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "elekat", "ReviewID": "UR57896045", "Content": "Stayed at this brand new hotel for just about two weeks.

I was pleasantly surprised to find there's a brand new Holiday Inn and I was able to use my points. It's located a short block off Flamingo between Buca Di Beppo and Roy's. The Holiday Inn is essentially at the back of the Candlewood Suites property on Paradise, for those who are familiar with where that is. Easy parking, they've got an indoor garage. You can take the same elevator from the garage right up to your room's floor, a nice touch. Very pleasant front desk personnel. Room on the somewhat smallish side. Bath quite large but only a large shower, no tub. My only real concern was the heating/AC unit - quite noisy. Had breakfast in the lounge/restaurant Saturday morning and I was the only customer. Really good omlette and service. As others have stated an easy walk to the Hard Rock, which I did. I would definitely consider staying here again in a pinch.", "Date": "February 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Great staff and free champagne!\u201d", "Author": "J-L-1977", "ReviewID": "UR52551369", "Content": "We stayed here the last week of the year. It's a new hotel and that can't be beat. New beds, new pillows, new bathroom. Is a good option away from the crowds and noise of the strip. The staff is attentive and care about all the small details. We had champagne for 13 at check-in and then 2 more rounds while we were making plans at the lobby. They close the parking gate at night and that makes you feel safe. The zone where the hotel is located is kind of lonely at night. If you want to go tho the main strips hotels and casinos, it is a very long walk but they shuttle you from free to the strip. The free internet was really fast. I had some trouble with my key because it needed to be re-programed on their system but otherwise everything went perfect. I would recommend this hotel to people whose main interest is not gambling... if it is, you should stay at a casino.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Blackstone Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d1396432-Reviews-Blackstone_Hotel-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$46 - $116*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4055 Palos Verdes Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NV</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">89119</span></span> (Formerly Holiday Inn Las Vegas)</span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515776", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/b7/f0/08/standard-guest-room.jpg"}}
