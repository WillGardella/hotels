The experience you have there, unfortunately you never forget though. Extremely unfriendly staff. To avoid people running away, they make you pay in advance, before checking the room. The queues for the breakfast were outrageous. A tiny breakfast room, people were waiting on the stairs for more than 20 minutes to get a table. The bedroom, small and dirty, could barely fit 2 people at the same time. Not mentioning the bathroom: one cannot move much even being alone inside. Sleeping without getting really drunk before it's impossible, too scary to fall asleep. Even Victoria Train Station, few meters away, has more room and cleaner toilets - better staying there.

I have never been so disgusted in all my life. We booked this hotel room through Venere.com and it cost us \u00c2\u00a343 for a double room for one night. On the website the room looked nice and clean and airy along with the breakfast room! But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe what you see \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the place is small, dingy and dirty! When I checked in I was firstly annoyed that I had to pay for the room before I was allowed to have the key! And as I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any cash on me I had to pay by debit card but what they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you on the hotel site was that there is a \u00c2\u00a33 charge when paying by card so really the room cost me \u00c2\u00a346 and I asked if I could pay in the morning when I checked out but I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allowed my key before I had paid! I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see how paying in the morning when you check out wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ok \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like every other hotel in the UK I have stayed in! But then I realised why they probably do that, so you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk out once you see the state of the rooms, as I would have done if I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already paid, but once you have paid they wont give you a refund as you need to give a 24 hour cancellation notice, otherwise you are charged for one nights stay! Once I had my key I walked in my room and the stench which was in it was disgusting, all I could smell was sewage! There was no way that I could stay in there so went down to reception to ask for another room, which was sorted out without a problem but the new room was not much better but at least it smelt fresher. The room itself was basic of basic! It was literally the size of 2 double beds put together with a small rail in the corner (there version of a wardrobe) to hang up clothes, but I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even hang them up properly without them getting creased again as it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t long enough. There was a small desk with a TV on it (of which all the TV channels were tuned in wrong and no remote control) so there was nowhere to put any of my toiletries so I had to live out of my suitcase, which left no room what so ever with that on the floor as well. Above the bed there were 3 spot lights \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only 1 of which worked! There was a hole in the ceiling, cracks in the walls, black marks on the paint, the sheets smelt of cigarette smoke \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was just filthy! And the bathroom wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much better either. The hook to hang your towel on had broken so there was nowhere to hang it. The toilet paper holder had broken, and the shower door had fallen off so we had to wedge it in place to stop water leaking when taking a shower! Then there was breakfast! \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Of which I ate nothing as I was absolutely disgusted with it. It was in a small shabby looking room at the front of the hotel with had 3 small tables in it. We sat down and there was no menu or anything so we had no idea what breakfast consisted of! Firstly we received a bowl of corn flakes, and then after that was toast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which when you looked closely you could see tiny bits of mould growing on the crusts, I was in the middle of eating a slice when my boyfriend noticed the mould on his and spat my mouthful back out! So I seriously advise NOBODY to stay in this dump and I will never stay in a budget hotel in London again! I really would rather pay an extra \u00c2\u00a320 for somewhere half decent, as even though it was only cheap you still expect it to be clean and not given mouldy food\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..or maybe that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just me being a little bit of a snob!", "Date": "November 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johannesburg", "Title": "\u201cGobsmacked....still recovering!!\u201d", "Author": "Gawie", "ReviewID": "UR5934192", "Content": "This Hotel left me speachless!

The shower was completely dismantled, the floor was collapsing, the basin was coming adrift and leaking, and everything was just filthy! We at first refused to stay there. It was late and we were worried that we wouldn't find alternative accomodation at that late hour. We stayed one night. It was like a scene from \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\".
