We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, so much so that we hope that you will allow us to make the Grand Bohemian our home away from home during future trips to Orlando. We have had the good fortune to travel throughout Europe, N. America and Asia and in those travels stayed in hotels billed as the \u201cpremier\u201d properties, but never have we truly felt like friends had invited us into their home. The pride you have in the hotel and in your staff will keep us coming back, as long as you will have us, for more of the Grand Bohemian! It is truly a shame that we don\u2019t live closer.

First of all, I love that this is a Marriott property and I'm treated to the same perks I get when I stay at a full-service Marriott property. The art in the hotel is amazing. I love that as you walk down each hallway, you have a sensory, artistic experience. I could have roamed down each of the hallways on the guest floors, but didn't want to seem like a deviant! In any case, the art in every part of the hotel was amazing. The room is beautiful and I love the Bose sound system with the hotel's own soundtrack. There is a nice sitting area to relax away from the comfortable bed. The concierge lounge was amazing--a great view and a beautiful space to spend time.

I live in Miami and I guess you could say I'm a bit of a hotel snob.I appreciate five star hotels and usually try to find one when I travel, either for business or pleasure. That being said, I also used to be an Orlando native and I'm very familiar with the hotel scene there. Unfortunately, downtown Orlando doesn't provide much of a selection for 5-star hotels. The true luxury properties like the Ritz Carlton, Waldorf, or Gaylord Palms are down South in the attractions area, and I needed to be downtown for this particular trip. The Grand Bohemian is pretty much it for \"luxury (ish)\" downtown. Priced just slightly under the other 5 star properties in Orlando, but also priced significantly more than Embassy Suites and The Sheraton...it's kind of in a league of its own. But nonetheless, I was excited to check it out and see just how trendy Orlando could possibly be. The lobby is the best part, the location is also perfect. Very central walking distance to great restaurants and bars in downtown. I really enjoyed the lounge and live music at night. The rooms definitely need an update in a big way. Everything is very dark - and the old lamps have got to go. They boast a chic lobby, but the old appearance of the furniture, lighting, and bathroom just don't fit. You would expect a trendy hotel to have the sleekest and cleanest bathrooms, an Ipod dock in the rooms (please remove the 1995 CD players), and some lighting that allows you to see while you're getting ready. I read some good reviews about the beds - but honestly, nowadays, all the boutique trendy properties have stepped it up a notch with cool things like a pillow menu, better linens, and a better TV. This hotel is trendy by 1995 standards...can someone please bring it up to date? And...about 4:30pm I get a knock on the door, followed by a housekeeper immediately opening up the door - without even giving me time to answer - (and after my room had already been clean for the day), to say, \"Everything ok?\" It was very strange. Why is someone coming into my room at all at 4:30pm?? I can understand in the morning to clean, but entering without even giving me a chance to answer is just unacceptable. I come to Orlando often, wish I could give this place a second chance...but Mr. Kessler has some room renovations to do first.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed more than a Disney Hotel\u201d", "Author": "awayofoffice", "ReviewID": "UR129168773", "Content": "We recently attended a conference in Orlando and had the pleasure of staying at your hotel.

Each of our offered thanks was responded to with \u201cmy pleasure\u201d and we really felt they meant it. Certainly in all our travels, which are many, this level of service was among the best. We loved the small details such as having the jazz music playing when we entered the room and having it there any time we wanted to listen. We dined often in the hotel and the food was exceptional as well. We extended our stay in Florida to take in the Disney Animal Kingdom Park and stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. It took 4 phone calls and 3 hours just to get two wine glasses to our room in that hotel. We also experienced several broken amenities in the Disney room and could not help but compare that stay to the Grand Bohemian. We defiantly will stay with you again on our next travels to Florida and be pleased to pass on our recommendations of your hotel. Our only regret was we meant to pick up a copy of the Kessler CD that played in our room!

So I would recommend this hotel if you are staying on business in Orlando and don't want to stay in a resort-y type place. My only comment (and I'm not sure it's even negative) is the pool area. It looks like it was designed for circa 2003 parties, but it's starting to feel oldish with it's 4 foot deep party pool and white chandeliers. There weren't any parties when I was there, so the whole thing felt kind of sad. And the hotub was not working when I went. One last thing: when I was there they were using one ply toilet paper.

Perfect getaway for my girlfriend and I. Not sure what the other negative reviews are about...? We wanted something nice but away from all the tourists. Beautiful hotel with a great location downtown. They have a real Starbucks in the lobby, not one of those fake \"brewed by Starbucks\" places. Anyways, we loved it. What a beautiful hotel! Lots of gorgeous artwork. Very authentic. Didn't feel at all like it had been Disney-fied. Very nice pool with hot tub that gets sun. Its up on the rooftop so you have privacy. Very quiet and relaxing. Fitness center was a little on the small side, but I didn't need it because the weather was perfect and I did my run through the beautiful downtown. Concierge gave me jogging directions to Lake Eola which had a perfect 1 mi loop around the lake. Anyways, here was our experience.... We checked in on a Thursday. We pulled up and were immediately greeted by the valet attendant who got a bellman to take our luggage. There was a doorman waiting to hold the door who greeted us. The only other places I've experienced everything on point like this are at Ritz Carlton and Waldorf-Astoria. But this felt so much warmer and genuine. We got there earlier than check-in time(4pm), but that wasn't a problem. I'm a Marriott Rewards member and I was upgraded to a 1-bedroom jacuzzi suite which was perfect for the couple's getaway. The girl at the front desk was great and immediately welcomed us. Very knowledgable about the area. (I've stayed in Orlando before and like to see what the staff knows and what they recommend) Check-in was quick and painless just the way it should be. Bellman escorted us to our room. I think his name was Jeff. Very professional. Told us all about the hotel and how the owner is an art collector and personally picks out all the pieces that are featured throughout the hotel. He recommended that if we were interested we should take a trip down to the level with the meeting rooms. Its set up just like an art gallery. We took him up on the suggestion later and he was right! I've never seen a hotel with this kind of art and decor before! The gf loved it too. We probably spent an hour looking at all the different kinds of paintings. Anyways, back to the room, when we arrived the lights were on and jazz music was playing in the room. Nice touch. (the bellman explained that their tagline is \"yours in Art and Music\") The room: Great space in the room. Separate bedroom. huge bathroom with a jacuzzi tub that opens up into the bedroom. Our room overlooked the city. Amazing architecture in the downtown area. Cool lights at night. Great soundproofing. We couldn't hear any of the downtown traffic or the weekend crowd. The king bed was super comfortable with lots of pillows. Upon further examination, I saw that the jazz music was coming from a Bose Soundmachine. They have one in every room. Very cool. I was able to hook up my iphone and listen to music, but I actually listened to the music CDs that were provided in the room. We liked them so much we took them with us (for a fee of course). Thursday night we had tickets to the Orlando Magic game. They have a brand new arena that is very close to the hotel. Walking distance so we never had to get the car. Saved on additional parking charges, and we saved on cab fare. For the win! We did room service for breakfast the next morning. We had ordered the night before with those menus you hang on your door. Everything arrived exactly how we had asked (I had made a note to use Egg Beaters for my order) and it arrived on-time and the food was hot. Perfect! On Friday we met friends at EPCOT for the day. It was a 30 minute drive from the hotel to EPCOT. Right down I-4. Not bad. Again, we didn't want a hotel in the middle of the tourist areas. We stayed until the park closed so when we came back to the hotel we just wanted to sleep. Upon return to the room we saw that \"turndown service\" had been provided. Our room had been cleaned up, the bed was ready for us, and the curtains had been pulled. Another nice touch. Saturday was a pool and relax day for us. We also explored the downtown area. The concierge was great. She recommended we go checkout a festival that was taking place at Lake Eola. We had a blast. Lots of local food and wine. There was a concert going on as well. It was all local people and it was great! No screaming kids and strollers! Saturday night we had reservations at La Boheme, the restaurant at the Grand Bohemian (see how that worked? ;) Anyways, AMAZING FOOD. I have never had a more amazing ribeye steak. I could barely eat it all. The service was perfect. The decor was gorgeous just like the rest of the hotel. Very deep rich reds and more artwork. That night we did test out the hot tub and it worked perfectly. I recommend pairing with a nice bottle of Veuve champagne. ;) Sunday morning: Brunch at La Boheme. Live piano on the grand piano they have? Wow, thats really nice. With live Sax as well?? Talk about a wow factor. The buffet was setup in the rotunda around the grand piano. (Thats what I love about this place, you are ALWAYS surrounded by amazing decor, artwork, music, style, etc). The food was incredible. And even though it was a buffet, the staff was still amazing. They had chefs preparing omeletes and seafood dishes right in front of you. Unlimited champagne with brunch is a nice touch. That was our trip! We had to leave after brunch unfortunately. What an amazing stay. This hotel has an amazing boutique feel to it with all the amenities you expect from the big boys and I still got my Marriott points! Honestly, this hotel should be training others, especially in the Orlando area. Every single staff member we encountered was great! We were warmly greeted by everyone. Every interaction seemed genuine. Everyone seems to love working there and that makes for a great guest experience! We will come back! Remember to ask about the art gallery in the meeting rooms if they are open!

The rates at this hotel are really very competitive for a 4+ star hotel. Do your research and check the direct website for some really good AAA / etc rates. There is Valet Parking only. This isn't really a big deal. If you've been to Downtown Orlando with a car, then you know that you could be blocks and blocks away to get to the nearest public parking lot. It's a swanky place with a lovely entrance. Even when we take the uber-gas sensible Toyota Corolla; we still valet. It makes for a much nicer and smother entrance to the hotel I can assure you. Since the building is sort of a \"high rise\" and in the high rise area of Downtown, you have to kind of drive into the first floor. I only mention this because there are a lot of one way street in that area, so you could get turned around or not be able to figure out how to approach the valet entrance. It is really quite a discrete area to keep the hotel nice and clean looking. Just keep it in mind, it's not a huge deal. Once you get out of the car it's a few steps to the front door and about 3-4 steps to your reception area. All in all, I believe I've stayed at this hotel 15 times and not once have I received poor service checking in. The staff is very nice, knowledgeable and eager to assist you. After you've checked in, it's just a few more steps and you're at the elevators to take you to your floor. The layout of the hotel is pretty simple and easy to navigate to your room. You will see an outrageous amount \"real\" art that is for sale all over the walls. There is a very impressive body of works on display, so make sure you take your time to soak it all in if you're in art buff. Let's get to the rooms....nice, comfortable and great beds. That sums it up in 4 words. Now in more detail, we stayed in a one bedroom suite during our November stay. WOW! The regular rooms are quite lavish with excellent bathrooms and fantastic decor throughout the room. This was our first suite at the Grand Bohemian and boy oh boy...was it grand. Now, don't start envisioning the presidential suite at Cesar's Palace. It has a different layout than the normal rooms as it in on the rotunda corner of the building. This area is a fantasic spot for watch the TV, hanging out on the couch, sitting down to eat or just soak in the view and enjoy a book. The bathrooms are always elegant, but not overdone. Beds are so comfortable that I'd like to take one home. Attached pictures will give you an idea of how the room looks. A couple of last things to mention. The bar / lounge in the lobby often has a great jazz band on Saturday nights and can make for a nice romantic evening without leaving the hotel at all. It's rather lush with a huge focus on art in the decor, rather breathtaking at times. There is also a fabulous restaurant on site, however I can't remember the name. I've only eaten there for Sunday Brunch and it's.......mouth watering. This was the first place I've ever had roasted Smoked Applewood Bacon cut to order, sinfully delicious. If you are able to book a reservation for any of the major holidays like mothers or fathers day...book it. It's probably going to run you in the range of $50 per person, however it's worth every penny. Often times the price of the brunch is inclusive of champagne or even wine. So, in some ways, it's a pretty good value for the money. There IS a pool. I can't remember what floor it's on (maybe 7). It's a nice little lap pool with spitting lion heads into it. There are excellent quality loungers on the deck, a hot tub and quite a fancy shmancy tented area with tables underneath it.

The requested extra foam pillows were in the room when we arrived. Bad: Concierge Level - don't waste your money, until they get a handle on this extra. Website stated 'Continental Breakfast, afternoon tea, hors d'oeuvres, cocktails for a fee, staffed from 5:30 - 9:30 p.m., all day free snacks - water - soda'. The breakfast was okay - fruits, oatmeal, individual seriously overcooked quiches, etc. There was NO afternoon tea. The hors d'oeuvres were GONE by 6:00 p.m., napkins were gone, no diet sodas and several other items were already depleted. The small club room was mobbed and one woman was working the tiny bar. My husband waited 15 minutes for one cocktail and a glass of wine. The 'free snacks' were NutriGrain bars, under-ripe oranges and green apples. There were 4 or 5 bottles of water, several each of ginger ale, club soda, lemon-lime, etc. in the small refrigerator. That's the extent of the 'free' items. TIP: Bring your own bottled water because the bottled waters in your room are $5. TIP: Don't even touch anything in the mini-bar, because it's electronic and will charge you if you just pick it up to look at it! (Tell the desk and they'll remove the charge, if it happens.) Also, turn-down service is included, but we didn't get one, so dirty glasses and towels remained with us the whole time. We also did not get a newspaper. At sunrise, the dust on the furniture was very visible, too. If the hotel is busy, make dinner AND brunch reservations. We couldn't get either at an acceptable time once we arrived. Concierge desk has a handout with a 2 for 1 Brunch coupon for hotel guests -nice savings, but don't wait to make reservations! At 8 on Sunday morning, the earliest available was 12:15. Dinner was either 5:00 or 7:00 - neither worked for us since we had to be at Amway by 7:30 and we'd had a wonderful appetizer in the bar at 2:30.

Based on our experiences in Orlando we were looking forward to this hotel that is promoted as very chic and part of the Marriott \"Autograph\" collection. We are big Marriott fans, but this place was a total letdown. We stayed on the 12th floor of the hotel. Our room had several spots of paint missing on the wall, a large black scuff mark on the wall as you walked in and very old and moldy rugs. My allergies really kicked in! Vacationing there during 95 degree heat and humidity I was stunned to find no fan in the bathroom. Terrible! Although the roomy is large, it was very shabby. The chair to the desk had three rips on the seat cushion. The \"art\" on the wall reminded me of the haunted mansion at Hollywood Studies. Everything in the hotel requires your room key, from the business center, to the pool, to the bathroom to using the elevator. Clearly there are safety issues with the area the hotel is located in. Although they promote themselves as a key conference location, they offer no complimentary shuttle service. The price for a cab is about $44 and a limo price is about $95. One of the real stunners was to find that if you move a drink or remove a drink from the fridge there is a sensor that automatically charges your room tab....whether you drink it or NOT. The fridge was lukewarm. I think the hotel really needs to step up. The few staff I saw around the dirty pool area were hiding on the side smoking. And, the pool...or should I say wading pool. It definitely is heated....so hot we couldn't swim. No worries though, we physically could not swim as the deepest area of the pool was 3 ft 6 inch with about 6-8 inches of water missing. Really, this can't be Marriott's best go of it. We'd never return. Although we did venture out and about, the half hour we were outside we were approached by two pan-handlers.

It really is a beautiful hotel with beautiful amenities. The room was large and spacious, the pool area beautiful. I am lucky enough to have a job that affords me the opportunity to stay in hotels such as this one so I feel confident reviewing one of this level. The pool area: beautiful, but the water was so hot. I doubt there is anything that can be done in AUGUST in Orlando! The issues I had though were mainly customer service: 1) When I called to see when the bar at the pool was open, the front desk informed me \"They don't really have a schedule. or at least not one they give to us.\" Odd. 2) I stayed for 4 nights. The first night we were awakened by an alarm going off in the room next door (alarm clock) at 5 AM. I called security who came up and shut it off. It happened again the next night. My friend called security and said this was the second time this had happened. It was shut off promptly. The third night it happened again, and I called downstairs, furious that they had simply been turning it off without TURNING IT OFF. That afternoon I asked the front desk to send someone up and sure enough, it was all set to happen again the next day. Unusual. 3) Upon check in, we were given a newsletter with an internet access code and informing us about the concierge lounge, \"available to all\" (was written verbatim in the newsletter). WHen we tried to visit it, our keys did not work and the front desk scolded us in front of other customers.. saying she'd let us in.. but it was very expensive.. and as they aren't really Marriott they can't honor these things. Being honest: I don't think I had enough points to qualify for the lounge, but given that I had been offered it, and it was in the paper they gave me, she made me feel like I owed her my firstborn for getting access and it was just condescending and incredibly rude. She should have just said no rather than schooling me in a public lobby adn telling me what a screw up her colleague was that had checked me in. The first rule of customer service is not to insult your colleagues, I thought. 4) The last night we headed downstairs for drinks only to see the lobby bar tented and loud renovations happening. I thought it was customary to be infomed upon checkin about these things happening. 5) We had the usual runaround with the minibar/stuff had accidentally been moved/the bar's electrical system was broken. The charges were removed promptly but not after being on hold for 15 minutes. In short, we had a lovely time. I would absolutely stay here again, but I would know to expect Courtyard Marriott customer service, not a four diamond property. And I would ask upon check in - have all alarms been turned off - when are renovations scheduled - will you be rescinding your offer of the concierge lounge -- and inform them, by the way, I will not touch the minibar and I'll BYOB with the pool bar. :)", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, New York", "Title": "\u201cInteresting Hotel\u201d", "Author": "rhkfreespirit", "ReviewID": "UR116299835", "Content": "This is quite a unique hotel in that it makes you feel that you are staying in a \"Beetlejuice\" version of a hotel!

Our families and we stayed last year during our wedding weekend, and everyone raved about how beautiful and perfect the hotel was. This last weekend, my husband and I decided to have a weekend getaway to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. We stayed two nights, three days. To begin with, the service is beyond exceptional at this hotel. Everyone, from the bellboy to the concierge to the housekeeping staff to the waitstaff at the restaurant, was more than kind and accommodating to our every need. A perfect example of the service provided by the staff at this hotel happened during our first night at the hotel. During dinner at the restaurant, one of the chefs actually came out to our table to clarify a special menu request I had. Aside from the quiet and romantic ambience at the restaurant, the food is wonderful as well!! The room we stayed in during our wedding weekend last year were very nice, but it was a suite with a jacuzzi tub in the room, so of course it would be nicer than a regular room! This weekend, in our regular room, I was not as impressed as I was with the suite. This room had some hairs on the floor around the toilet area, and the air conditioning in the room never seemed to get cool enough. We were on the top floor of the hotel, and it was a very hot weekend, but I would expect the room to be cooler. The thermostat had no way to be read, so we never knew what the temperature was in our room. The rest of that floor felt about the same temperature, but down on the first and fifth floor it was much cooler. Lastly, I want to talk about my visit to the spa. Being pregnant, I had some special requests during my visit, and I must say that I was highly impressed. I've had facials, massages, and prenatal massages all over the country, and I'd rank this massage and facial at the top of my list. My spa esthetician was Rhonda. She did an excellent job and I have never felt more relaxed! Another plus of this hotel is its location. It is within a few blocks (about 5-10 minutes walking) of many great restaurants, a huge movie theater, nightclubs and bars, and other entertainment.

I was ready to give the hotel a perfect score, but then I had an incident with my bill that upset me very greatly and was ready to downgrade the score. After letting a little time pass, I got over the extreme anger and was able to objectively give the hotel very high marks. First, I will go over the many good points. The hotel is located right downtown and is in walking distance to a number of bars and restaurants. The lobby is wonderfully appointed. The hotel has a tremendous \"art\" theme on every single floor and even has its own gallery. The art work was great throughout the whole hotel including the rooms. The front desk staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I had a king bed room and it was plenty large with a pretty large bathroom as well. The bathroom had dual shower-heads. The room had a large flat screen TV and a CD of cool music playing when I walked in. The bed was very comfortable. There was a large, extended sitting chair. The concierge lounge was very nicely appointed and the snacks/breakfast were just fine. The outdoor pool area was very nice on the 6th floor of the hotel and the fitness room was nice as well with ellipticals, treadmills, nautilus and free weights. The valet brought cars quickly. Now for the very few \"bad\" things. A relatively minor issue was that the air conditioning temperature control was one of those old style controls with no digital display and you just put in on cool with hi or low fan. Even with it on cool and \"hi\", it was not cool enough in the room for my taste. Such a nice hotel should have a more modern temperature control. The real \"bad\" thing was looking at my bill in the morning. I was extremely surprised to see charge after charge after charge after charge for perhaps 15 items from the mini-bar. I did not consume a single item from the mini-bar. The only thing I had done was take out two waters from the minibar and put in two small diet coke bottles for the night. I replaced the waters in the morning. After I got the bill, I went back and noticed for the first time a small sticker on the door of the minibar indicating that items would be charged automatically when removed. As indicated, all I removed were the water bottles. In the process, I had knocked over some beer bottles inside the minibar and simply straightened them out right away. They never left the cooler. Yet, they were all still on this bill. This \"automatic\" billing minibar has to be one of the worst pieces of hotel technology I have ever seen. It clearly did not work right. I have to believe the hotel has received many, many complaints about it. Their \"stated\" purpose of not having items removed to store other items is understandable, but the technology just doesn't work right and caused me much grief and anger. I called the front desk. They did quickly agree to remove the items, but I have not seen my adjusted bill yet to verify it was done. I didn't need that hassle.

The rooms were clean and the maid service was top notch. Valet guys were great, and the general vibe of the hotel was fun. We had a room overlooking the pool. Although the pool was small, it was big enough for a quick dip and the lounge chairs around the pool looked nice. I went to the fitness room and thought it was a touch better than a Marriott Courtyard fitness room, thus, it was a let down. Now the bad. I had breakfast at the main restaurant on Sunday morning. We were seated at 930am and a grumpy, out of it, lady came walking by and said good morning. She managed to serve the two gentlemen sitting across from us quickly, but did not bother with us. By 945a, I had to get up and ask the bus boy for coffee. 10a, no coffee. I got up again and asked the bus boy. Got the coffee. 1010ish, no orders taken for food. I had to get up and walked almost into the kitchen to get someone. Finally, 1030a, got our hot food. You get the picture. It was so awful that I should have left, but I was too stubborn.

The crew at this breakfast could give two you know whats and, when I complained, it's apparent that the management could give a crap.

We dreaded the long trip by car because in previous stays, also for business, all we remembered was the terrible traffic in that area and the lack of activities that interested us. Finding this hotel on the Marriott website made it easy to get a room, and our trip was memorable for the right reasons this time. The Room While my husband attended a meeting in downtown Orlando, we stayed in room 720, a large corner suite, on Wednesday and Thursday nights earlier this month. Throughout this art-themed hotel, the walls are covered with interesting pieces of art , and the colors of the furnishings add to the artsy decor. The light brown walls and heavy purple drapes and furniture were quite pleasant in our room, which was very well laid out with a large living room for working and watching TV. (See photo) As bright and sunny as it usually in Orlando, closing the thick curtains and dimming the light should provide a respite from the summer heat. The only downsides in the room were that it was a bit dark at night and we could not remove items from the minibar fridge and cool the foods we preferred, such as Diet Dr. Pepper and yogurt. (So we left them in our ice chest and just changed the ice twice a day.) The king bed was pleasantly comfortable considering we sleep on a Tempurpedic foam mattress at home. There is a lot of typical city noise outside\u2026sirens, cars, trains, etc., because you are in the middle of a city. So it is a transition for us coming from a very quiet neighborhood where the major sounds are loud birds squawking in the backyard. But the thick drapes help insulate from the city noise as does the i-Pod music player. And we always carry something to help us sleep in big cities. Breakfast in the Upstairs Lounge The food was tasty and well displayed in the small lounge, which was too crowded at times to get a table. The servers were first class, and the atmosphere was relaxing. We also enjoyed visiting the Lounge in the evening. The Pool and Gym It was too windy to use the lovely outdoor pool (see photo) with a beautiful cabana and you guessed it, more outstanding sculpture! In good weather, this would be a nice place to park yourself and a friend for a relaxing day. The gyn looked just okay, but I was too busy beading to use it. The Value We normally spend under $120. per night for business travel rooms at various Marriott properties; this hotel provided good value and a first class experience. After searching a bit online, we took the lowest available rate on Marriott\u2019s site and paid $200. per night plus tax. Weekend nights appear to be more expensive. It was wonderful receiving Marriott points for our stay because that is why we can take long vacations in countries where there are Marriotts. Also the letter welcoming us to the hotel was a nice touch, but they really butchered my husband\u2019s strange name even though our reservation was made through Marriott online with the correct spelling. The Art Wow! We loved looking at the art gallery and paintings throughout the hotel. We understand that the owner ran out of wall space and home and had to build a hotel to house the rest of his collection. In an hour of gawking and taking photos of the art, I managed to view less than half of the walls before getting dizzy, or should I say high on art! There are very few art-themed hotels, especially of the 12 story size. We stayed in the art-themed Renaissance Arts in New Orleans just before Katrina and enjoyed being surrounded by art there as well. It is wonderful that original artists have a built in audience in rare hotels like this one. The gallery on the main floor offers many colorful works for sale. Restaurant The high point of our stay was dinner in the Bohemia restaurant on the main floor. Everything was perfect about the meal from the menus that were backlit to the crab ravioli and grilled romaine lettuce. Nanna from Armenia was our server, and she did a first class job meeting our needs. The prices were reasonable considering the quality of everything, and it was easy spending the evening in the hotel after being out all day. It was fun before entering the restaurant to listen to the Bosendorfer piano being played so passionately. (There is a second Bosendorfer upstairs between the meeting rooms.) We did not stop in the bar for a drink, but it looked inviting as well. Many folks have told us that the hotel\u2019s Sunday buffet is outstanding. Very Minor Issues We really enjoyed our stay at this fine hotel. Our main complaint was that when we called enroute from Daytona, the hotel operator gave us the wrong exit off of I-4, and there is no such thing. Exit 83 was closed, so that was no help. We had to drive around a bit to find the place after taking the next exit. Our GPS was not in the rental car with us, and there was not time to find the exit on my iPhone after we realized the exit they gave us was wrong. Also the letter welcoming us to the hotel was a nice touch, but they really butchered my husband\u2019s strange name even though our reservation was made through Marriott online with the correct spelling. What to do in the Orlando area The last day of our stay, I drove just a few miles from downtown Orlando to Winter Park, the home of the Morse Museum, which houses the largest collection of Louis Tiffany work. This place is a must see especially after February 2011 when their new addition is complete. We have seen Tiffany pieces in many museums all over, but none have such quality and breadth. The gift shop offers a great selection of art books and Motawi tile. This museum is at the top of our list when we return to Orlando. For lunch there are plenty of fine restaurants in the downtown area. We did not have time to see the museum at Rollins College nor the Henry Leu Gardens, but will check see them on our return. If you enjoy making beaded items, there is a wonderful shop, the Bead Bar, a few miles from the hotel. If you are driving from the Daytona area, you can also stop at Imagine That!, my favorite US bead store, just east of I-95 in Ormond Beach. Beading is a wonderful way to relax while on vacation, and you end up having some nice, custom jewelry to wear home. Just beware that your friends will demand that you make jewelry for them as well! Summary We will return to this hotel when we return to Orlando. We despise most things related to theme parks, and this hotel allowed us to forget that Disney is/was Orlando. The hotel makes you feel as if you are in a grown up city, not one that focuses on fun for the kids.", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Naples, Florida", "Title": "\u201cEclectic, fun, artsy!\u201d", "Author": "sunshine34467", "ReviewID": "UR82662491", "Content": "Great hotel.

The concierge was apologetic that no more were available, they only had Wall Street Journal's left, but offered to go across the lobby to the adjoining Starbucks to see if they had them. I told her that wasn't necessary, that I was going to grab a coffee later anyway and thanked her for the information. I did go to Starbucks's and they did have the paper. I stopped by the concierge on my way up to the pool to grab one of the WSJ's she mentioned and there on the corner of the desk was a NYT with my name on it. When she realized that I had in fact purchased one, she apologized for my trouble and without hesitation went to petty cash and reimbursed me for it. WOW. This hotel understands that it truly is the little things and attention to detail that separate the wannabes from the real thing. They deserve your business.", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando", "Title": "\u201cGrand Bohemian Exceeded my Expectations\u201d", "Author": "KCORLANDO", "ReviewID": "UR79492920", "Content": "My husband and I were married in a private ceremony in Negril, Jamaica, this July.

While our supply of coffee was refilled only 3 creamers were provided and no artificial sweetener was left for us (If we used it once don't you think we might use it again). It is certainly a minor thing but when I had to get dressed and go to the concierge lounge for cream and sweetener when I didn't want to... something minor becomes larger. One used glass was replaced and the other one left dirty behind the water filled ice bucket. I guess we didn't get a clean one because??? No big deal I can wash a glass but again, I didn't want to. Breakfast in the consierge lounge was nothing special...heavy on carbs and low on protein like most hotels. The art was lovely but not enough of an attraction to recommend this hotel. All in all we slept in comfort however I prefer to use the ameneties at a hotel and not have them rented out and even a 2 star will refill the coffee condiments.

I had requested early check-in online and did not run into any difficulties when arriving half hour early prior to the 3pm check in time.

There was a free concert being held on Saturday night across the street and so the music could definitely be heard and the intersection closed off and drew much foot traffic, but it was shut down at about 10pm or so and didn't bother us since we were headed out for the night ourselves well past that time anyways.

The bride and groom were both suppose to each have a suite with an adjoining room for the groomsmen and bridesmaids. There was no room for the bridesmaids and the groomsmen were down the hall. The \"welcome bags\" were never given out until the grooms mother asked about them an hour before the wedding. The night of the wedding the couple stayed in the brides suite which I had asked to be cleaned, it was not done and as a gift from the hotel for their \" troubles\" a bottle of champagne and strawberries were put on a dirty table.

My biggest complaint - given my plan for a relaxing Sunday morning after a night out - is it was *impossible* to relax at the pool! The pool area is nicer than the average urban rooftop pool - beautiful decor, surprisingly little street noise. There is a large canopied area with tables and chairs to stay out of the sun, and several lounge chairs around the edge of the deck - in my opinion, not enough chairs. After just a few people arrived at the people, it began to feel very crowded (and once one of them started smoking, it was impossible to avoid the smoke...a big deal to me, but it may not bother others). The space might be more comfortable if the canopy was smaller and the chairs were more spread out, but that would apparently interfere with events such as weddings. Which leads to THE WEDDING PLANNERS! I was already not feeling totally comfortable at the pool when a troupe of VERY loud, VERY obnoxious wedding planners showed up and began marching around the pool deck, shouting orders at each other, completely oblivious to the people trying to relax inches away (literally - one of them bumped my feet as she walked past, and didn't even acknowledge it).

The room is comfortable enough with the standard stuff. Internet is charged per day (can\u2019t recall how much as I used mobile bb).

We're from Michigan so we thought a weekend in Orlando would be a nice break from the cold weather, and we were right. Downtown Orlando isn't huge but I felt like the Grand Bohemian was right in the middle of everything - all the bars and restaurants and sites you need are within walking distance. The ambiance and decor of the Grand Bohemian lives up to it's name and to ones expectations - there is incredible artwork everywhere - including the hallways and in your room. The rooms are very nice, with comfortable beds, decorating that I would be happy to have in my home, and a big flat screen TV (great for watching the superbowl!). We stayed on the 6th floor, and that is where the fitness center and outdoor (wonderful) pool, hot tub and sitting area are located. It was great for us because we used the hot tub every day - it was a GREAT place to have a drink and relax while being surrounded by palm trees. However - and in my mind this is minor but I could see how some people wouldn't like this - our window faced the walkway that surrounded the pool (the pool was elevated so you couldn't see swimmers and they couldn't see you) and on that walkway were potted trees and tables and chairs. A few times I saw people walking right by my window, which was startling at first and you definitely need to be mindful of what you're wearing! BUT, again, this was minor, but be aware if you're checking in and they tell you you're on the 6th floor. I would suggest walking to the nearby markets to stock up on wine, beer and snacks, if you like those things - as I think the least expensive glass of wine on the bar menu was 10 bucks. The rooms were so nice, and the fact that they provide good wine glasses in your room made me happy to have a drink there before heading out to dinner. If you like brunch (and you don't mind paying 29 bucks) then you MUST have the brunch at the Grand Bohemian. Shrimp, eggs benedict, crab legs, ribs, and so much more - it was all fantastic!! Best of all, the mimosas were only 5 bucks each, a great deal. The bar area is again very classy, very nice, and they have a great jazz band on Saturday night. We saw a very interesting mix of people staying at the GB, anywhere from families, groups of single guys and girls out to party, to the entire Wizards basketball team. It has a wide appeal because it's a truly unique and fun place to be. Nearby, enjoy Urban Flats restaurant (a great bargin for fantastic food), Corona Cigar, if you're interested in the biggest selection of cigars and scotches one can imagine, Ember, which is a nice outdoor bar that gets a little clubby at night, take a walk around Eola Lake where you can feed ducks and swans, and much, much more........", "Date": "February 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGreat location.\u201d", "Author": "CanadianinMadrid", "ReviewID": "UR55076042", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel last week for only one night as I had business meetings the next day.

When we got to the desk a very charming young lady (I think Krissy or Kristin) welcomed us (what a smile) and checked us in. She was very nice, gave us a quick verbal tour of the hotel and sent us on our way. Luis helped us with our luggage and was so very nice. We arrived to our Jacuzzi Suite, which at that time Luis gave us a tour of our room. The room was beautiful filled with dark rich colors throughout. The restroom was a generous size and the Jacuzzi tub was perfect. Along with the Bose radio and large flat screen TV all the amenities you would expect in a luxury hotel room was provided. We took a walk around the hotel and everywhere you went was amazing artwork, from paintings, sculptures, busts etc...The hotel is simply a art musuem!

My husband and I booked an overnight stay, Saturday, with reservations for the Jazz Brunch at the hotel restaurant, The Boheme, on Sunday to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Since our last overnight stay, three years ago, I have to say the hotel is as lovely as ever, but there are a few areas for improvement. WE paid $138 for a deluxe suite - very affordable for a downtown Orlando 4 1/2 star hotel. I appreciated the discounted price even more after observing a few dissappointents. The doorman and front desk representative were courteous and efficient upon check-in. I was not thrilled when I read a notice at the front desk stating we would not have access to the swimming pool from 10 AM - 3:00 PM and 4:30 PM - 6 PM. The hotel was having not just one special event, but two that day! Perhaps this is why our room was at such a good rate? Not ones to dwell on the negative, we proceeded to our room on the 8th floor with a view of the pool. The rooms are spacious with a bedroom and adjoining sitting area and very clean. We had a king bed with plush down bedding and down pillows, a flat screen TV, stocked refrigerator and snack bar, red velvet couch and a desk and chair. The bathroom is very nice with a marble floor, plush terry robes for two, and a double spa type shower head, large vanity and basic toiletries, shampoo/conditioner, soap, lotion were Kessler's brand. My satisfaction with the room was diminished by the loud thump, thump, thump of the DJ playing top 40 music for the private party at the pool. (I am 44, my husband 51) We are not opposed to people having a good time, especially if they paid the higher rate for a special party, but c'mon!!! We heard the music as clearly as if were there partying with them. Apparently, management tried to keep a control on the sound level as it occassional was turned down, but minutes later was right back up again. So much for taking a nap while waiting for the pool and spa to be free. The bed was plush and comfortable. We enjoyed the Bose stereo and the compilation CD Kessler provides for their guests to play while visiting. If you like the CD enough you may take it home for $15.95. Unfortunately, we could not hear the TV or the stereo over the DJ until he left. At 3 PM we went down to the 6th floor to go to the pool and spa and the temperature of the water was heavenly. I was a bit disappointed by the appearance of the pool and spa, both need resurfacing as they are cracked and discolored from patching and wear and tear. In the meantime, the pool surface needs a good scrubbing. The pool lounge chairs are comfortable, but the ivory colored fabric is turning brown and should be replaced...ugh! I put several towels down as I didn't want to lay on dirty lounge chairs. Overall, the pool area needs a facelift. Although we did not have time to use the exercise equipment in the fitness center, it is very well set up with everything from weights to stair climbers and treadmills with flat screen TVs. They even provide complimentary headphones for their guests. There is not an actual spa on premise, but massage, facials and body treatments are available in room by appointment. We did order room service for lunch. The order was taken courteously and delivered within 30 minutes. Of course, the price was about $50 for lunch for two, but that is to be expected of room service in an upscale hotel. The unique theme of this hotel is Kessler's unusual collection of artwork in rooms and all common areas. There is something for people of all artistic tastes. The hotel possesses one of only two Bosendorfer pianos. On Friday and Saturday evenings, the hotel lounge is a popular place for a cocktail live jazz from 8 PM- 10:30 PM. My cocktail recommendation: The Pomegranite martini is delicious! My husband loves that Crown Royal Reserve is served here. The hotel is very clean throughout with one peculiar housekeeping oversight to mention. Many of the doors in the hotel require a good cleaning as they have fingerprints and other dirt on them. It was a strange oversight that I found on our room door, the bathroom door and on several doors in the common areas. We have frequented the hotel lounge of this artsy, eclectic hotel over the last six years and always have a good time. There was a wonderful love seat in the corner we found with a spacious marble coffee table. From here we could hear the jazz from the other room quite clearly and also do some people watching. The lounge also offers the full room service menu if you care to eat while enjoying a cocktail or two. We have enjoyed the Sunday Jazz Brunch before and enjoyed it just as well today. At $50 a person, it is pricey, but it is a unique brunch with live piano jazz, unlimited champagne and mimosas, shrimp, crab legs, sushi, and several signature meat dishes along with carved ham and new york strip. All in all, we had a fantastic week-end and will return in a year or so. I hope to find a newly refurbished pool, spa, and deck when we return:)", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cNice, but not entirely worth the money\u201d", "Author": "LegoJoe", "ReviewID": "UR32925079", "Content": "I will have to say that my expectations were high coming to the Grand Bohemian because of all the great reviews on Trip Advisor.

Check in-uneventful-however, they told us the pool would be closed for 4 hours during prime time on Saturday!!! Yes, it was...they apparently schedule events up at the pool, which in my opinion is pretty inconvenient when you are paying for amenities. Pool-Nice, again...they closed it for an event on Saturday afternoon. There is NO pool bar. The look at the pool is nice; however, the white lawnchairs are getting brown, etc. Needs a touch up here. Fitness Center-small but nice. Rooms--they were nice, again nothing spectacular. Don't expect a 5 star Ritz Carlton or 4 Seasons...it's not like that here. The eclectic art is very interesting---a great touch. There was a purple couch in our room! Shower/Bathroom were great-. Everything very clean. Bathroom Amenities nice & we enjoyed that they brewed Starbucks. Bar--very nice, modern. We enjoyed this very much. Very cool lite up menu. Room Service--very good, but expensive. $50 for 2 people.

The hotel impresses the moment you pull up to valet parking - an elegant entry & foyer leading to a room that was as beautiful and well appointed as anything I have stayed in for <$200 per night. The impressive thing about the Grand Bo is it manages to avoid feeling like a hotel, or a chain for that matter. Lovely velour, wood and of course the beautiful original artwork really creates a special atmosphere. Location is perfect for downtown Orlando - you are right on Orange Ave where all the nightlife happens on the weekends, and I imagine for business activities during the week. Weekends were very quiet during the day but thats a typical American downtown for you - luckily a fine breakfast diner is located just a couple of blocks up on Park St. The negative ? Well having stayed largely in chains earlier in my stay - I got used to the niceties of your typical Hampton or Ramada - free fast internet, decent included breakfast, free parking, FF miles etc. I guess a hotel as upmarket as the Grand Bo can charge in spades for all these things (and not give any miles) because it is what it is - one of the finest & stylish hotels I have had the pleasure of staying at. An extra highlight being among the Cleveland Cavalier players during their stay for the NBA Eastern Conference finals of 2009 - I think also a testimony to the quality of the hotel. And kudos to the staff especially the parking valet guys - a really nice helpful bunch of young guys. So I would obviously recommend the Grand Bo to anyone staying in downtown Orlando - and if you can find a base rate under $200 a night it becomes very good value for money.", "Date": "May 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Altamonte Springs, FL", "Title": "\u201cArtsty, eclectic, city vibe!\u201d", "Author": "SunDollyOz", "ReviewID": "UR28347653", "Content": "My friends met at the Grand Bohemian Hotel in downtown Orlando for one night in April 2009.

Lots of warm colors and funky artwork. Everyone was nice and friendly. We stayed on the 11th floor, but had access to the concierge level on the 15th floor. Our room had 2 queen beds with white, fluffy linens and a purple chaise lounge. We had a nice city view. It was a standard room. We booked with American Express for a discount of $149. We started off at the concierge level happy hour. It was a cash bar (surprised there wasn't atleast wine / beer service) and crackers and cheese. The room was very comfortable though with a nice city view. The attendant was very friendly. Then, we headed to the bar. We loved the vibe there. It's just a lot of fun, and the service was wonderful. We did have an incident with an over friendly hotel guest that crossed the line. Benjamin went above and beyond to make up feel comfortable. Continental breakfast was offered at the concierge club. The highlight is the \"rooftop\" pool which is on the 6th floor. It reminds me of the Mondrian in LA... lots of white lounge chairs and sofas. Unfortunately, there wasn't a bar there, but eventually, a waitress did stop by to take drink orders. Just a note... the pool is often closed to guests for weddings and corporate events. This can be during the day or evening. There are a lot of weddings held at this hotel on the weekends. The housekeeping staff was great... and special thanks to Kamal. He was so accomodating.

I wish we could've stayed a little longer. We arrived late but check in was very smooth. We wished that we could've parked our own car, but it seems valet is the only option for $21 overnight. However, it didn't prove to be a big hassle since they run to your car to get anything you might have forgotten. (I had forgotten my cell phone in the unprepared rush to get out of the car) Everyone on the staff are extremely courteous and attentive to your needs. (interesting British accents with the room attendants) Tips are shown appreciation but not at all pressured everywhere. Even when I'm just waiting in the lounge near the bar, the bartender comes up and brings me water with a welcoming manner. Now the hotel feels narrow like most of the Orlando Downtown buildings, but the high celings and rich opulence of the place is very attractive. Maroon lighting, burgundy accents, and mahogany woods coupled with edgy artwork and jazz music nightly made the place feel so swanky. I put the cute black dress on cuz I felt really high class. I also felt very safe because you need to scan your active room key to get to any floor other than Lobby on the elevator. The room itself was very nice though traditionally narrow. However the accomadations were thoughtful. Starbucks coffee with mugs&to-go cups, great cucumber melon toiletries, very comfortable beds, robes, flat screen tv, great view of the pool. You merely need to ask for free neccessities like shoe polish, sewing kit, lint brush, detergent for handwash clothes. They'll provide maps for you and try to read your mind for your next need. I was impressed. However, internet is not free. I saw a few of the other amenities. The pool with whirlpool looked small but nice, located on the 5th floor. It was shadowed by a large permanent tent/pavillion that looked perfect for the wedding that took place the night we arrived. It is a great place to catch some sun because it has a great view of the city. I didn't see what the fitness center looked like. The gallery is just a small hallway but it had great original work featured from local and national artists. Truly the whole hotel is more the gallery because they saturate all the walls on all floors. Your room has at least 4 unique large printed canvas paintings. I looked into my husband's conference rooms and they were adequately sized with a large projector screens for lecture. The service is what it's all about. They provided really great food. Juices, fruit, hot breakfast. For lunch, they had wraps, clam chowder bisque, assorted cookies... just a ridiculous spread. Checking out was absolutely a dream. They gladly extended my check out to 1pm. It gave me time to walk around the city and look at Downtown clubs still slumbering and eateries quietly open on a Saturday late morning. When I had to check out, I still had to wait for my husband still at conference. When I wanted to put my bags in the car, that's when valet posed a slight problem. However, they were happy to put our luggage into \"storage\" which seemed very secure. I didn't worry about our expensive laptop in their hands. At $127/night, I was very impressed. A few tips with downtown: \"look very cute and sexy but high class:\" you'll find yourself wanting to look nice for the expensive restaurants (average$30-$40/plate a la carte but worth it!) and then compete with the half-dressed young girls trying to get people into the wild party clubs. \"No shopping\" Downtown Orlando is certainly a culture/club scene. Nothing else within walking distance. (The outlet malls of Orlando are actually very good if you go just before Christmas.) \"Good public transportation\" the free Lymmo is a nice, quick bus service that runs up and down the Downtown area (and stops closeby the GB!) However, it's really not a very long walk and if you want to appreciate the place, the blocks are very small. Also they keep the area clean, well kept, and safe. A whiff of sewer can be expected sometimes though. \"If you're a nerd like me, check out the library\" I walked by a large building that was actually the Orlando library. It was huge and so nice! Who would've thought an eating place would've been inside a library? \"Eat at the Breakfast Club:\" Located very close to the GB (front desk can give you a map) is a breakfast and lunch place that has reasonable prices. You can order sandwiches, omelettes, crepes to your heart's content. I ordered the Flamingo crepe, which was to die for. For $8, you get hashbrowns, 4 half-slices of large toast, and a sizeable crepe filled with fresh vegetables&cheese, fresh avocado, turkey and bacon pieces, and topped with sourcream and salsa. Soooo good! So this was a great short trip for greaat food, culture and music, and royal treatment.

As I stated before, the Grand Bohemian is a nice alternative to the hubbub of Disney. But the flip side is that there really is not much going on in downtown Orlando, and not much you can walk to. But there are some nice restaurants a short drive away in the Lake Eola area. The one area where I would say the Grand Bohemian is not five-star is in its service.

We were in Jacksonville with cabin fever and thought we would move south to Orlando to be closer to Miami. We were with a dog so had restrictions on where we couuld stay. The pricepoint was great, the hotel looked good on paper (their website was impressive) so we booked them. We could have got a rate for $140 for our room if we booked thru hotels.com, but you could not amend your trip after booking specific dates so we went with the higher rate of $190 (we ended up checking out two days early) which was good considering the hotel and what it offered. Valet was attentive, professional and very welcoming. Front desk, from what I could tell as I did not do the check in, was good. The room was spectacular. We had a view of the pool, sitting area, desk, and a king size bed. Based on previous reviews of this hotel (I did research it) we did also find the snack/mini bar strange with their \"remove it, you bought it\" policy. It offended my friend, but I guess I could understand as why do you have to touch a Snickers bar to see what it is? Only problem was, we had open cans of dog food that we couldn't make room for in the fridge out of fear of being charged for whatever we moved. Needs some work for guests with dogs or special needs of a fridge. We deposited the dog and wanted to grab lunch. I asked the concierge after we got to our room and left our dog in it and asked her where to go to eat. She directed us to a lunch place OUTSIDE of the hotel. My friend asked the front desk and referred us to the dining room and had a very good lunch. Staff was a tad overwhelmed as it is \"off season\" and staff was minimal. We also did breakfast in the dining room instead of the brunch, though I hear good things about the brunch. My one negative of our stay was the front desk. I feel they deserve their various Diamond Awards over the last 4 years. However, it didn't come from the front desk. I have stayed at Mandarin Oriental, Four Seasons, and Peninsula Hotels. The front desk at these locations always acknowledge you on the way in or out of the hotel, especially on the way in, welcoming you back. We were acknowledged more by the valet/bellmen than the front desk staff. Everything else about the hotel says Mandarin, Four Seasons, except this aspect of the hotel. Also, when asking the front desk person what was in the area of the restaurant we were going to, she had no clue where it was or the restaurant we were going to. My experience is the front desk should have as good a knowledge of the area as the concierge, the same concierge that was telling us to go outside the hotel for lunch! Would stay here again in a heartbeat. I am not sure what their normal in-season rate would be, but I would return! Valet Parking price is normal for any city. Location is downtown and lends itself to a business trip, however to get anywhere in Orlando, you need to drive unless you stay at a hotel on the property of a theme park.

The bathroom amenities were three small bottles and single a sink. The shower did have two showerheads however; water-pressure was pretty weak.

The breakfast was pretty pathetic with fresh fruits, cereals, muffins and pancakes. There were no eggs and conventional bread. It was the same on Friday thru Sunday.

Saturday night, the smoke alarm in our room went off. We all got up and left the room thinking that alarm was going off everywhere.

Another instance was some less than satisfactory services at the Boheme resturant , but I do believe that was.the exception rather than the norm. These inequities were far offset by the many other outstanding staff members. Principally among them I would place the gracious bell captian Jose. From the time I exited the car at arrival he has stopped at no length to ensure my comfort. Overall I'd rank the Grand Bohemian about a 8 or 8.5 our of 10 for a downtown type hotel, and probably the best in Orlando.

Chose hotel after reading reviews, and liked the idea of the jazz bar. Unfortunately, we have to agree with the review by JAXTRVLR. The room was very ordinary. There was not even a flat-screen TV which does not jibe with the image they are trying to portray. The TV cabinet was deep, and there was not much room between the cabinet and the foot of the bed. The hotel touts their art work, but the pictures in the room were cheap, dated prints. The bathroom was ordinary. No separate shower nor enclosed commode. Only 3 towels were provided. Very basic amenities. The soundproofing was inadequate. Not only could we hear groups of noisy people in the hallway at all hours, we could even hear the ice machine. They advertise they do not rent rooms to people under 21, but we encountered very young people in the elevator in sloppy clothes, carrying on loudly and drinking alcohol. We had a reservation at the dining room for 8 PM, but found it empty except for one couple. Thinking that was not a very promising sign, we decided to go elsewhere. The small pool area was closed for a private function. The function board indicated many more future private events at the pool, depriving the hotel guest of an expected amenity. As JAXTRVLR mentioned, the car entry is very awkward and congested. The hotel does not compare to the Kessler property in Savannah. It is more a typical 2 1/2 or 3* business hotel. At over $200, we did not feel it was worthwhile. Would rather have paid a bit more for Hyatt Grand Cypress or Ritz Carlton.

On the club floor, they have free breakfast, everyday, as well as cocktails (not free) and hors d'oeuvres each night. The lounge is very posh and the music is amazing. The staff at the front desk was fast, friendly and very efficient. We did eat at their restaurant (Boheme) one night, which was a very good meal, though extremely pricey. We actually had one negative experience while dining, which was resolved the next morning. The server described the specials of the day (around $35), and I asked to have one of the specials be modified slightly. The server said she would have the chef accommodate that request. When the bill came, my entree cost $60!! My husband and I were shocked, as all of the other entrees in the menu were in the $30-40 range, and the one she described was $35. The bill was charged to our room, and we didn't make a fuss that night. The next morning, I stopped at the front desk and explained the discrepancy in the prices, and the fact that the server never mentioned that my meal would be $60. The front desk clerk immediately spoke with the restaurant manager and credited our account $30, which I thought was fair. The food though, was very fresh and they gave us huge portions. The concierge made several recommendations for seeing some local sites (not Disney related!). The hotel is in walking distance to Church Street Stations, which has some great bars and restaurants. We went to the Cheyenne Saloon one night, and it was a very exciting experience. Even if you don't enjoy country music, you must see the amazing architecture in this place.

As a classic luxury hotel in a grand older building, the Bohemian is a welcome exception to the cookie-cutter business hotels in town, and a far different experience from the numerous resort and vacation properties in the outer Orlando sprawl. Although the small lobby is decked out in bold colors and features bright contemporary artwork, both for show and sale, at heart, the Grand Bohemian is a serious, old-style city-center business hotel, and if you are in town on business, or just plain sick of resort hotels full of loud and sunburned hordes in t-shirts and flip-flops, there's no better place to stay. This is decidedly not an Orlando fun, sun and boat drinks sort of place: the staid ambience feels far more of Chicago or Philadelphia than anything remotely Floridian. The Bohemian's rooms are very large, comfortable, and very attractively furnished and decorated. The air conditioning - - all important in Orlando's swampy climate - - is strong, efficient and blessedly quiet. Beds and bedding are first rate. The work-out room is nothing special, but the pool, on a 6th floor outdoor terrace, is beautiful and pure bliss. For runners not afraid of serious humidity, the pathways around Lake Eola, just a couple blocks from the hotel, are exceptionally pretty jogging grounds. Hotel staff are mostly well trained, eager and helpful. The parking valets were quick to offer cold, bottled water when I returned from a run, and also quick to retrieve my car when needed. The concierge is very helpful. The front desk had a little trouble retrieving my reservation from the hotel's web-site, but recovered quickly and professionally. As others have noted, downtown Orlando is something of a work in progress, but there are plenty of nearby places to eat and drink.

We heard the GB was the best hotel in downtown Orlando. In fact, it has won some \"Best of\" awards from Orlando Magazine. We had an executive suite and the accomodations were fine. The room was pretty quiet and the bed was comfortable. But for $350 a night, I expected a bit more in the way of service. We tried to have drinks in the bar upon arrival; it took the waitress nearly 25 minutes to locate the wine we had ordered. Since she had disappeared, there was no way to tell her that we had changed our minds and wanted to go to sleep instead! No worries as she never did locate the bottle. Service at lunch was also remarkably slow (and there were only two other guests in the bar at the time). I spent a small fortune on lunch at the hotel because the concierge had told me that nothing was open for lunch on Saturday in downtown Orlando within walking distance of the hotel. When I later told this to friends who have lived in Orlando for 12 years, they told me how wrong that information was. In fact, the following day, I enjoyed breakfast and lunch within several blocks of the hotel on a friend's recommendation. I also waited a half hour for a cab when departing for the airport. The valets struggled to find me one, and it was I who suggested they call and then call back dispatch when the cab had still not arrived. It's not as if they were understaffed -- there were five valets on at the time, and on a Sunday afternoon, it wasn't busy. Also, our entire floor smelled of paint...and we actually saw open paint cans and brushes on a cart on our floor. Locals told me there just aren't that many accomodation options in downtown Orlando. That may be, but when spending this kind of money, a guest should expect a certain level of service.

Having stayed at the Viceroy and Mondrian in Los Angeles, we expected much the same - an upscale boutique hotel. Unfortunately, it was just an okay hotel, and not worth the money. All 5 lamps in our room were broken. One didn't work at all, while the others were extremely difficult to turn on. We just kept spinning the switch around and around. It became a huge joke, but in truth it was annoying. The room was large and clean, but the windows were a sliver, and when we tried to open the drapes the pull broke off immediately. We left the pull on the floor and no one ever fixed it. There were other things in the room that were shotty - the base of the showerhead was broken off and the wireless connection ($13 a day) was so weak we had to sit at the desk to use it. As far as value goes, we had long days, so we ordered room service. Of course, this is not an inexpensive choice, but even with a 22% gratuity added automatically and a $3 service charge, the waiter told us that he did not receive this money, implying that we should tip him further. Also, to park your car at this hotel, you must use their valet service (no self park) at a whopping $20 a day, plus tips. In all it was just a big disappointment. The saving grace was the access to a Starbucks store in the lobby, which at least got our days off to a nicely caffeined start.

I guess I will begin by saying that we were really looking forward to staying at the Grand Bohemian. Being from Florida, and visiting Orlando many times, I have heard such great things about this hotel. Being a frequent vistor of trip advisor, I was aware of the parking, internet charges...but not the nickel and diming for everything. First off, couldnt find street parking, so we had to fork over $21.25 a day for parking. How ridiculous, it should be FREE when staying at the hotel. It costs $11 a day to have internet access, all the food in the room is ridiculously overpirced. We are a younger couple (late 20's), and are not picky at all. We appreciate the little things and like to have a good stay when forking over some heavy money for a hotel room. Upon arriving for check in, we given are keys and not told about the location of the pool, spa services, gym, etc. No mention of anything- heres your key, have a nice stay. We get to our room, two queen beds. Of course we booked a king. Call down to the front desk and they tell us there are no kings left. Great start, no mention of this when checking in, so you can imagine my frustration already. They come up with a plan and tell us there is one king available, but it is handicap. I give them the ok just as long as we are switched the next day. Enough with my story, let me tell you about the hotel. The hotel is very nice and the rooms are quite honestly, nothing spectacular. Nothing better than, say a Embassy Suites. However, the bar and pool are fantastic. I would describe the hotel as a gothic, artsy setting. The location is fantastic if you will be hitting up the bars on orange ave and church st. I will quickly summarize the problems. 1. Given handicap room, so shower was the same level as the bathroom floor. There was a flood like a damn levee broke every time we took a shower. 2. The shower had no hot water, with the exception of one time. What ajoke that was. 3. No fan in the bathroom (are you serious, yes I am). So if you frequent the bathroom like I do, your traveling companion will smell your stinky booty for an hour. 4. $21.25 a day for parking (had to repeat this) 5. Called down for fresh towels, took 45 MINUTES to get them. Absolutley unacceptable, especially when you are waiting to take a shower. 6. Construction above us from 9am-6pm, constant hammering thump. Of course, we were not told about this when checking in. And when your trying to sleep off an Orange Ave hangover, hammering at 9am is no fun. 7. Overbooked, didnt get the room we should have. 8. Greeted horribly at check in, treated like a second class citizen bc we didnt roll up in a porsche or bentley. 9. Charged by the minute to use the internet in the business center. Everywhere i have ever used the business center in the United States has been free; nickel and diming again. 10. Supposed to get a newspaper at your door every morning. Well guess who's room was the only one to not have a paper either days of our stay? One last thing too mention, the tv is a 26 incher from 1995. This high of hotel class, you would at least expect a flat screen. So would I stay here again?

I tagged along for a little R&R and quality time without our children. We are both originally from central FL and realize that there is more to Orlando than the Big Mouse, although the options have always been a bit limited. More times than not I opt to stay home when heads to Orlando. That said, we could not have been more impressed with the Grand Bohemian. We are semi-frequent travelers and can say we have stayed in some pretty nice places over the years. What I generally find is that regardless of how much we spend, the \"better\" hotels are all pretty much the same...nice, but not stellar. This hotel was different. EVERYTHING about it was great. The staff was attentive, the valets were quick and courteous, the sounds of live jazz permeated the sleek lobby...even the elevators are comfortable!!! (Who ever heard of \"comfortable or even hip elevators??!!) Our room was on the 12th floor. Based on info we acuired from previous reviews, we requested a room facing away from the fire department. Our room overlooked the chic pool area and onto the growing city. We heard sirens one time, and it was briefly around 8PM. As we entered the room, we were met with more beautiful music quietly playing on the bedside Bose radio. The bed was so comfortable (clearly a hold-over \"dream bed\" from the days when the hotel was a Westin). And even though I loved the convenience of the Starbucks next door to the lobby, I also enjoyed the comfy robe and complimentary starbucks coffee that were both provided for me IN the room! The hotel is very centrally located to everything that is NOT theme park related and made it very convenient for daily shopping and evening dining (try anything in Thorton Park!). In the end, we didn't want to leave. The \"negatives\"? I can only think of two: 1. In this day and age NO ONE should have to PAY $9.95/day for internet access in a hotel. 2. Same goes for the exhorbitant amount of $$ required to keep the car parked in the parking garage! I try to be loyal to posting reviews on TripAdvisor, since I rely on it so much in my own travel planning.

LOCATION: The Grand Bohemian Hotel (\"GBH\") is a design hotel located in the heart of downtown Orlando and within walking distance to numerous cafes and bars. Like most of Orlando, downtown is a safe area in which to walk at all hours. The building itself is beautiful, as can be seen from the hotel's website. Due to its location downtown and away from WaltDisneySeaWorldMGMUNiversal-de-Soleil, it appears to cater mainly to (i) businesspeople and (ii) locals looking for a posh getaway. It is by no means a \"touristy\" hotel (you won't see the kids with the mickey ears running around the GBH). And, yep, there's a Starbucks downstairs, which is great! COMMON AREAS: The lobby is quite a work of \"art.\" The hotel contains original artworks, many of which are for sale. There is an enormous and unique piano in the lobby, as well as a posh bar and restaurant which appears to be the place to be at night in this neighborhood. Cool jazz music is piped in all over the hotel/elevators/hallways. THE ROOM: As stated, I was given a lovely suite (Room 934), which contains a separate living room and bedroom. The bathroom had a tub/shower whcih was quite large. Starbucks coffee and a little coffee maker were in the bathroom with the appropriate coffee condiments. Also lots of nice Gilchrist & Soames toiletries. (As an aside, I read the reviews below about the bathroom tiles. I don't know what the fuss was about. This was a non-issue for me). The living room was appointed with a large red sofa, a red armchair, and table and chairs. It had its own huge armoir containing a TV (tons of recent \"in theater\" movies for a charge) and mini bar. Two pieces of original artwork hung in the living room. The bedroom contained a california-king-sized bed with white duvet and linens. This used to be a Weston Hotel, and I believe the bed is one of the Weston beds, as it was extremely comfortable (the origin of the bed is purely speculative; the bed being very comfy is fact). The bedroom also contained a similar large armoir with TV and lots of drawers. There are two separate and spacious closets, which was a bit of a waste for me since I only spent one night but otherwise plentiful room for anyone spending a few days. Two bathrobes were provided. A Bose Wave CD radio was on the nightstand in the bedroom. The bedroom contained a large work desk with a high speed internet connection that was very fast indeed (but a $9.95 charge). ROOM SERVICE: The suite was so nice that I chose not to leave it, so I ordered room service from the expansive menu. Delivery was within 30 minutes and everything was cooked to perfection. (Try the wedge salad). Room service deliveryperson was, like all other staff, extremely friendly. 22% tip included + delivery charge (this was overlooked because of the suite upgrade and I shall not look a gift horse in the mouth so for the record I'm not complaining). STAFF: This is the category for which the hotel really shines. From valet parking, to check in, to room service, the staff were terrific and should be commended. Smiles, smiles, smiles. Staff can really make or break a hotel and they were the primary reason that I gave GBH a 5-star review. NOISE ISSUES OR LACK THEREOF: Reading the other reviews below, I was prepared to be located next to a firehouse. Yes, right outside my window indeed is the esteemed \"City of Orlando Fire Station No. 1\". There were emergency vehicles pulling out of the station quite frequently sirens blazing but I just ignored it (it's common city noise). This issue didn't disrupt my stay whatsoever. Otherwise, the room itself was very quiet and I did not hear my neighbors. In sum, this will be my new hotel of choice when in downtown Orlando. Here are the pros and cons to wrap things up: PROS: Staff; design of the hotel; room service menu; room appointment. CONS: Pretty steep valet parking fee; $9.95 charge for Internet access (kind of unecessary for a hotel catering to business guests).", "Date": "March 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cMust Stay at the GB for a Night\u201d", "Author": "Sunskin", "ReviewID": "UR6940161", "Content": "I recently had the distinct pleasure of styaing at the Grand Bohemian Hotel in Orlando, FL.

Since I feel as though I was mislead when we booked the room, I will start with the cons. Prior to booking the room my wife asked if the hotel was close to the Orange County Convention Center. The person my wife spoke with said yes, it's a couple of blocks away. Great news, so I thought. I'd walk to the convention, make my rounds, go back to the room and relax for awhile and then return to the convention for the second part of the day. Well, that's not quite how things worked out. The morning that I geared up to go to the convention center, I stopped at the front desk and asked how to get to the convention center. I was told to take a taxi. I explained that I was told I could walk there, but the woman behind the desk told me I would want to take a taxi as it wasn't within walking distance. However, she assured me it wasn't far. So I jump in a taxi and the cabbie drives a number of blocks and then proceeds to enter the expressway. He drives for about 15-20 minutes and $37.00 (with tip) later I am at the convention center. The reality is that the convention center is in excess of 13 miles from the hotel, so don't be fooled like I was. So much for going back to the hotel for a little R&R and then returning to the show for the second part of the day. I spent over $70.00 in taxis each day going to and from the convention center. I was pretty ticked off that they reeled me in by telling me they were close to the convention center. One other thing to note, the complimentary convention shuttles do not service downtown hotels. Morale of story: if you stay downtown, be prepared to pay hefty taxi fares. To continue with the cons of this place, there are freight train tracks close to the hotel -- and those tracks are utilized 24 hours a day. I heard a locomotive's horn several times a night as I was trying to sleep. If that wasn't enough, the hotel is one block away from a fire house. You got it. Throughout the night, when the fire house received calls, I was awakened by sirens! If that wasn't enough, I could hear the couple in the adjacent room talking and sneezing. Another issue is that the ceramic tile floor in the bathroom didn't look clean. The hotel addresses this by having a card in the bathroom explaining that the tile really is clean, but it's defective and they are addressing the problem with whomever they bought it from. Whatever. It looks to me as though the installers didn't do a very good job cleaning the grout and/or mortar and it left stains on the white ceramic. Nevertheless, for the money this hotel charges, I expect better than ceramic tile in the bathroom. On to the good comments, or at least the things that appealed to me about the hotel: it's located away from the chaos of the touristy areas and hotel/motel row. This hotel appears to be geared toward business travelers, so you are not dodging kids running through the hallways and lobby. The room was clean and was a decent size. It accommodated a king sized bed, armoire, couch for lounging, a desk, a table, current pay-per-view movies, a Bose Wave radio, in room internet access (for a fee) and the television remote had a sleep timer. The room also had an iron and ironing board, if you are so inclined. There were various condiments and drinks available, for a fee, in the room. There was a complimentary newspaper each morning and a coffee machine with complimentary Starbucks coffee packets in the room. Nevertheless I preferred to go downstairs to the onsite Starbucks for my morning jolt. I needed an extremely potent concoction as a result of my interupted sleep. The business center is okay, it's open 24 hours. It has a copy machine and a couple of computers, all available for a fee. The bar was nice, had decent food and live entertainment (jazz). It was comfortable and staffed by friendly people. You can sit at the bar, a table or relax in a comfy chair or love seat while enjoying a couple of drinks. There's an outdoor pool, hot tub and cabana as well. However, the pool is only about 3' deep. I'm not much for public pools or hot tubs, but it was nice to relax outdoors in the cabana area. It was a good place to unwind after sitting through rush hour traffic from the convention center. The pool area and cabana is actually kind of attractive and not a bad place to chill. Each time I was up there, there was only one other person hanging out there -- so it evidently doesn't get too crowded especially considering the hotel was at capacity. The hotel security is good in that you need a key card to access the hotel's upper floors (where the rooms are located) when you enter the elevator. The neighborhood the hotel is located in is urban contemporary and has several restaruants that are worth trying. The area is not overrun with people. In fact, after about 5:00, it quiets down quite a bit as the people who work in the offices leave the area and go home. There are some condominium developments currently underway that should bring more people to the area after hours, but right now it's a low keyed, safe area that offers an escape from the chaos that one can experience in Orlando.", "Date": "February 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "tampa", "Title": "\u201cIf you are looking for a quiet night don't stay here\u201d", "Author": "freqtravelerTampa", "ReviewID": "UR6705711", "Content": "The hotel is beautiful and the staff was great.

I had selected this particular hotel because I thought that there would be fewer kids (Which turned out to be accurate). As stated in other reviews, the lobby, bar, and common areas are very well appointed. The trouble is the same level of detail has not been expanded into the rooms. We stayed in an Executive Suite \u2013 the room was very dark, dark colored walls and trim. Someone had been in the room and turned on the radio for \u201cambiance\u201d, but didn\u2019t bother to leave any lights on for us. We stumbled through the room since none of the light switches actually powered anything (You had to still switch the lights on and off manually). Normally this would not be that big of an issue, but the light switches glow brightly, so it was annoying to have it glaring in the dark when you are trying to get to sleep, especially since they did not control anything anyway. All of the furniture in the sitting area was heavily stained. In fact, someone must have had quite an evening in that room \u2013 you could see stains on the walls from where full plates of food were thrown at the wall. They had obviously tried to paint over the stains, but the paint only made the streaks \u201cshiny\u201d. The bathroom did not have a fan, so the entire room felt like a sauna after each shower. In addition, they had recently (and poorly) re-grouted the tile \u2013 grout was smeared everywhere, making the floor look dirty. The tub was very small with a shower curtain. Room service and valet are very expensive. Valet is $22.00 and room service charges a $3.00 \u201cdelivery fee\u201d and a 22% gratuity on top of the already high prices (We paid $30 for ice cream and fruit). The big positive to this hotel is that the service was excellent. Everyone at the front desk, concierge desk, business office, and bar was extremely attentive. Bonus \u2013 Starbucks on the ground floor if you are a coffee addict. There are a few very good restaurants, both casual and upscale, within walking distance.

The bride recommended this and another hotel. We decided to wing it and bid online for a 4* in Orlando (its the only one) and got this hotel for a GREAT price. The whole place is quite beautiful and well appointed. We liked the art, the lobby bar, the look and feel of a fancy artsy hotel. The room seemed clean, internet was fine. There were a few things that we didn't like. The first room they gave us was in the interior corner. It had one window in the far corner about 8 inches wide and 6 feet tall. I felt like we were in a coffin, it should not have been a room, more like a storage closet. We called down and told them that it would not do. They moved us right away to a better room. Do not come here if you plan to lay in the sun and get some color. Their major flaw in designing the hotel is that they built the hotel to block the pool area from the sun. We were there in November, and there was some sun on the pool area until about 10am, and then it was shade all afternoon - very frustrating when you've come to see the sun. The pool area is just beautiful, white padded lounge chairs, a canopy with chandeliers, tons of towels - but no sun. Also, the key card system in the elevator was a bit pedestrian. It seemed only to slow the system down, and its all the secure as all you have to do is wait for someone else to get in the elevator, and then you can press any button once they've entered their key card. Valet was pricey - and not very informed. We took a cab one night, asked the valet to give the cabbie directions, and the valet's directions took us in the completely wrong direction, cost us 20 min and was super frustrating. Don't ask them for directions. I know the hotel was about to leave the Westin family when we stayed there.

The hotel, however, is no longer associated with Westin hotels, a point which is left to the traveler to discover. As the name \"Westin\" is to us tatamount to room width and length being approximately equal, it was no small matter when we discovered after having arrived, registered, and entered our room, that the approximate distance from the bathroom door to the opposite interior wall seemed to be no greater than the same measurement within a much less expensive hotel...certainly a small matter, but understand it is not a Westin room. The price for an evening stay seemed quite reasonable when associated with the photgraphs of the hotel and it's rooms at the Grand Bohemian Hotel website. Color me unintelligent, but when I viewed the pictures at their web site, I still had no knowledge that I was not looking at a Westin hotel...obviously an oversight on my part, but buyer beware...if you are expecting a typical Westin hotel room with an abundance of space, the two queen rooms are little larger than other less expensive hotel rooms. Per their website, the food served from their restaurant is some of the finest food severed in all of Florida. That statement could be true If form over substance is the system by which you measure quality. If substance over form, however, is the system by which you determine quality, then I believe you will judge the food from their restaurant to be simply above average.

Here is a breakdown of some pros and cons that I experienced during my stays- Pros: -Great bed=great sleep: Fantastic beds!! This is the biggest reason that I kept coming back... very comfortable. -Nice rooms: Clean, quality furniture with nice lighting and roomy bathrooms (even though the floors and pipes currently look cracked and broken- there's been an apology note for that in every bathroom I've had) -Very unique ambiance: Love the theme. I haven't seen that anywhere else and enjoy the dark colour schemes as well as the art work and mannequins- a very nice touch. -Hotel bar: Great place to relax over a cocktail after a long day. -Location: Great downtown location, most offices and restaurants are nearby. -Staff: Helpful when needed.....but.... (see 'Cons' below) Cons: -Staff: One or two seem like genuinely nice people; the rest rubbed many of us the wrong way. Most of the staff give off a and unapproachable vibe. I have the feeling that many of the staff believe this is the Four Seasons.... its not (and the staff would be a lot warmer if it was!) -Feeling of 'nickel and diming': I understand that quality costs money. What I don\u2019t understand is the need to charge ridiculously high rates for rooms (see Four Seasons reference) while continuing to charge for **everything** Although it wasn't my own money, the fact that the room service prices were higher than any other hotel I've stayed at in Orlando (and actually worse tasting than them) and business center pricing was thru the roof ($1/page printing, $5/page fax) turned me off. -Required valet parking at $20/day: Seemed like a good idea at first, but 20 minute waits in the morning (even when calling ahead) as well as the fact that it is MUCH higher priced than other hotels in the area turned me off to it later on. This could also be filed under \"nickel and diming\" -$10/day internet fee: Again, this could be filed under 'nickel and diming' but I felt like it deserved its own point. To be fair, other hotels in the area have this fee, but they are much less expensive than the ~$250/night we were paying at the Westin. Overall, it\u2019s a very nice hotel and I'm glad that my company recommended it.

It was super swanky, and for two young adults from Iowa, who aren't used to such a fancy place, this was a nice change! We stayed on the 14th floor and had a beautiful view of the downtown area. From our room, we could see the pool on the 6th floor. We did use the pool - 3 feet across the whole way. It's good for cooling off after laying out, which is what we used it for! We had drinks in the hotel bar/restaurant one night before going out. There was a live 3 piece band playing - piano, singer, & saxophone. It was a bit loud, but our bartender was very polite. Drinks were expensive, but everything at the hotel was. Room service was out of the question for the price they were asking, but we don't usually use room service anyway.

I called the front desk & explained that I didn't want to be charged for the robe, and she told me she would contact the executive housekeeper.

It's trying to be a world-class hotel full of art and excitement, when it's actually just a corporate place to rest your head. The attitude of a girl at the front desk was so snobbish that I think it ruined my stay. I apparently made the horrendous mistake of wearing a baseball cap while I was checking in. Maybe she was having a bad day, but the overall feeling of the staff creeped me out with their snobbish attitude. I'm in the corporate world and stay at starwood hotels often, and a couple of my favorite hotels are in their W chain. While I've encountered a little snobbishness here and there, the attitude at this Orlando location took top spot. The grounds of the hotel are all right. It's not a high rise, and two of its four sides are dwarfed by high rises, so if you like a view, your chances are slim of getting one from your window. The pool is on the \"rooftop\" of the sixth floor (the hotel is 12 or 13 floors). It may have been a nice idea if they didn't put a 7' wall around the pool area so that you can't see anything. The pool is very small and only 3 1/2' deep. The spa/whirlpool didn't work, and had a sign stating such with a \"frown\" face. I'm pretty sure it was written by a guest, because I think a staff person would have wrote something like, \"You're not good enough for the spa, so we turned it off.\" The workout room, although very small, was equipped with modern equipment and was very nice. The room was decent, and the beds were okay. They are supposed to be their \"heavenly\" beds, but I really didn't find them to be anything great. I love the beds at W hotels, but these were a little too firm and the pillows were far too small. The bathroom was large, but the shower was retarded. Although it had two showerheads, the shower curtain is much too short so that when you try to take a shower, the entire bathroom floor gets soaked (I had to use all my spare towels each time to soak up the water). They indicated, via a small sign, that they were having issues with their bathroom tiles. I wonder if they're smart enough to add the two together. Also, the shower head came out of the wall and the pipe was exposed. I don't really care and probably wouldn't mention it, but since they gave me so much attitude, I figure what the heck. As for the food served through room service, it was pretty tame. I ordered a few appitizers for myself and my guest. Two of the three were decent and both priced at around $13, which I thought was fair for room service. What really ticked me off, however, was the $11 order of \"crispy potatoes\" which I swear were Ore Irda microwave fries. They were really gross, which cracked me up since their description on the menu sounds very gourmet. It's a theme of the hotel. As for the room overall, it was adequate. The pictures posted on this site sum it up. It's corporate, plain, with a few pieces of art thrown here and there. If you don't know too much about art, but like to think you do, you'll probably love it. The review about Orlando being a cultural wasteland likely sums up the hotel: pretentious, snobbish, arrogant, ignorant, blah, blah, blah. If you have no concerns about money and you like to travel to mid-size cities and complain about how they aren't NYC, stay here and find others at the bar who will complain with you. For the rest of you who obviously realize Orlando is not New York, is not Miami, but is its own city, consider staying somewhere that's not so expensive, and spend your money on the culture that dwells outside of Orange Ave. If you do stay here, try to deal with the young Asian-American male who works at the front desk. He was the only one who seemed genuinely nice. My hotel bill incorrectly had $105 of extra charges, and he corrected it and apologized.

My major complaint is the staff at the hotel. Everyone seems so plastic and disingenuous. They have these spiels that they always say that make you roll your eyes, especially when it\u2019s delivered in a Ben Stein monotone voice. \u201cThank you for calling the Westin Grand Bohemian, an experience in art and music, where may I direct your call?\u201d was one that grew old very quickly. Also, every time you happen to run into an employee in the hotel, rather than just saying good day or something, they feel the need to go into detail about the art in the hotel or tell you how great the property is. I felt more like I was on a museum tour than in a hotel and my wife and I quickly learned to avoid all contact with employees if possible. We didn\u2019t eat in the restaurant so I can\u2019t comment on that, but out of everyone at the hotel, the best employees that we encountered were the valet drivers. They made excellent dinner recommendations and gave great directions. Earlier when I asked a front desk agent how to get to the TD Waterhouse center I was told that they weren\u2019t sure, but they would get someone to help me out, 10 minutes later a manager came out and gave me directions, but one would think someone working the front desk would know where a local attraction 4 blocks from the hotel is. On a good note, the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The room was of adequate size and was clean, but I suppose the Embassy Suites has spoiled me with its extra touches. For instance, when I stay at an ES, I have complimentary water and Milano cookies in the room, at the Westin they wanted to charge me $5 for a bottle of Evian. The bathroom was spacious and had very nice amenities; the only gripe with it was how tiny the bathtub was. They call the thing a heavenly tub, but my standard bathtub at home is larger. We did however enjoy the double-headed shower. Like I said before, I\u2019m not one to normally complain, but I was really mad when I left this hotel.

The hotel is quite nice, very tastefully appointed in my opinion. I had a very large room with a king bed and a couch. All in all it was a fine stay, but I do agree with some of the negative reviews on this hotel. Not to nitpick, but: The \"heavenly bath\" is a joke. The tubs are your basic ordinary (small) bathtubs, and there isn't even any bath bubble powder in the rooms. About the only thing that stands out is the dual-head showers, but if you look closely you'll notice that even those (as well as the sink fixtures and toilet) are cheap \"pretend-elegant\" fixtures. It's a bit incongrous with the marble sink and floor, but maybe they were running over-budget on the bathrooms. The place absolutely has a \"renovated motel\" feel to it. The doors slam loudly and can be heard in the rooms, and the corridors are low and dark, and there are definitely too many signs directing guests to the ice machines. One other strange experience made me feel like I was staying in a hotel which was trying to prove its merit: EVERY staff member whom I encountered was quick to tell me how wonderful the hotel was. Whether it was the waitress in the restaurant explaining to me (unprompted by any inquiry) that the artwork was all original and from the personal collection of the owner and then going on to explain to me how wonderful the presentation of my salad was, or the bartender chatting me up and reminding me I was in the best bar in Orlando, it's clear the staff is coached on reminding guests how lucky they are to be staying here. It was unsettling to me, as if they were all trying to hide some insecurity the place has about its place in the hotel world. A note on the restaurant: it's good, very good even, but it's extremely expensive - disproportionately so. Dinner for one with salad, dessert, coffee and two glasses of wine ran me $100. I'm no cheapskate when it comes to dining, but this place just wasn't worth the price tag. A much better dining option is the short menu in the bar - sandwiches and appetizers like spring rolls and calamari run around $10-$12. I had a great burger and an even better tenderloin sandwich. Breakfast at the restaurant is adequate, but at the usual exorbitant hotel prices. I would definitely stay again, and have no real complaints about the hotel.

We stayed at the hotel for a romantic, relaxing weekend and the Westin definitely fulfilled that need. The rooms are quite large and decorated modernly with dark wood furnishings, royal purples and browns, and great art on every wall. The bathroom was luxurious with 2 shower heads (great water pressure), marble countertop, large shower & mirrors, and comfy bathrobes. My room also had a nice table/sofa area and a large tv, but by far my favorite thing was the BED. It was the most comfortable bed ever...tons of pillows, soft sheets, and a great feather comforter. Our view was of the pool located on top of the parking garage. It was surreal to be swimming around these huge buildings. The pool is a medium size pool with an attached jacuzzi. My only complaint was the jacuzzi was a too hot and it was a bit annoying to be swimming and see pepole watching you from their room. The area is clean and there are lounge chairs to lay out and a shaded area under a canopy w/ chandeliers (a nice touch). The hotel is located near clubs, bars and resturants in the downtown area, which was nice b/c we could walk everywhere. It is also a few blocks away from Lake Eola, which is a lake in the middle of downtown. It's a nice, relaxing walk around the lake and surprisingly very quiet. I did find a few negative things about the hotel such as parking, it's ONLY VALET PARKING and it's quite expensive - about $19 a night (more if you have a SUV). There aren't many parking spaces in downtown, so you're forced to park there. The entrance is difficult to find, in the pictures it appears to be on the corner but really it's next to the valet enterance in the back (watch out when you're trying to find it b/c there is bus only lanes and lots of one way streets). Also something I found a bit annoying was the hotel sponsors an art scholorship and adds $1 to your bill, this was not told to us beforehand and I found out our last day when I got my valet bill. Granted it's only a $1 so you feel obligated to leave it on there, and it does mention if you don't want to participate you can take it out, which by then you feel cheap since it's only $1. It's a \"sneaky\" way of getting people to contribute, even though it's a worthy cause.

Don't imagine it's cockroach infested or any such thing, its got nice features, the bed for one is absolutely gorgeous. However, I couldn't help but feel there is a certain amount of disingenuity here... Firstly, take a standard mid-range Orlando hotel, paint on a thin veneer of class (as in add a few framed pictures, throw in some above average furniture), then, add lots of overpriced extras to make people feel like they are staying somewhere super special and voila, you have The Westin Grand Bohemian. I do understand the building's size & location has limited what they could do with the place, so i'll excuse the tiny low ceilinged corridors. The ice dispensers on every floor feel a little motelish, but thats just being picky. It's when I enter the bathroom and find that the \"Heavenly Bath\" they proudly advertise on their website has turned into a \"Heavenly Shower\", that I begin to feel a little let down. Oh, it's a bath to be sure, but one that would scarcely fit a midget amputee. I then move to the back of the room and spy a large bottle of Evian water sitting on the desk. \"Complimentary! What a wonderful touch.\" I think to myself, as it is located nowhere near the mini bar, however I am disappointed to find that a $5 price tag hangs from the kneck. After suffering the midday heat of Orlando, this is a cruel blow indeed. So I take a shower in the Heavenly Shower, and the double shower heads are really doing my body a great service, and after that pleasentness, I slip my body into a bathrobe which I feel I must purchase for myself, because it is *the* best bathrobe that has ever had the pleasure of being wrapped around my shivering form.

It's nice to have the ambience, but it would be better to at least have the option of being able to see when you wanted to. Second, and more importantly, there's one small air vent at one end of the room, and the air just doesn't circulate. There was a strong burning-plastic smell in the room that never went away the whole time we were there, even with the fan set on high. Third, downtown Orlando is a ghost town, and as a result, this hotel has nothing attractive in walking distance. That, along with the poor air quality and dark rooms, means that you'd be far better off staying in Winter Park near shops and walking streets, or in the Disney area where you'd at least have a nice view out the window.
