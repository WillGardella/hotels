The room was cheap and had a shared bathroom, so our expectations were quite low... we wanted somewhere to sleep and nothing more. So we were pleased to be pleasantly surprised... the location was absolutely fantastic, within walking distance on the Empire State Building, Penn Station, Times Square... we also walked down to the 9/11 Memorial and the Staten Island ferry terminal, and also up to Central Park, but appreciate that this isn't everyone's idea of 'walking distance'! The room was on the small side and the window looked out onto a brick wall (essentially rendering the room windowless), but it was clean with a TV, phone and wash basin, and did exactly what we wanted it to do - gave us somewhere to sleep! There were two shared bathrooms near to our room, both were clean and we never had to queue. One was right next to our room and my fiance said that he woke a couple of times during the night due to people using the bathroom, but I slept right through.

It's a good, central location close to a lot of attractions (Empire State could be seen from the window) and transportation - many within walking distance - earlier that day we had dropped our bags off and walked south to SoHo and later on we walked north to Columbus circle. So if you don't mind walking (and that's probably the best way to see anywhere) then the location should suit you just fine. As for the cost, at around 67 dollars (before taxes - after taxes 80) it was just about the cheapest thing in New York we could find for two people. For the location and quality this isn't a bad deal at all. The room was clean and decently kept, with a sink and a mirror, though the bathroom was shared. The bed was decently comfy though a little on the softer side. The decor of the hotel was a little dated but almost in a charming circa 1940s kind of way. The staff were nice, and had a convenient bag check service if you arrive before check in, or check out but need somewhere to drop your bags. However, it bears noting that the Hotel itself could use some renovations beyond decor. The soundproofing wasn't great and the walls were quite thin. If you're used to packing earplugs when you travel then this won't be a big deal at all. In short, one of the only major downsides was noise. Street noise is unavoidable in New York, but hearing the adjacent room's TV isn't. Either way this is hardly a big enough downside for which to avoid the place. Another downside was that the hot water took quite a while to circulate and the shower took a few minutes to heat up. Again, a rather petty complaint. In short - it's a very no frills kind of hotel that's a little outdated in a few ways. But if you're going to see the city and want a centrally located place just to crash that is better than a hostel, then this should suit you just fine.

There I was searching on the web, for affordable hotels two week before my trip to New York. Hotel 31 on East 31st Street, between Lexington and Park Avenue often appeared as a choice. It seemed perfect. This hotel is in a pleasant neighborhood and close to my customers. I was to stay in NY, for one week and luckily I was able to get a room for four nights--the weekend was booked. Room 711 on the 7th floor with shared bathrooms, a small bedroom with a queen sized bed and a beige sink to the left side, with window view to the Chrysler building. Not bad I thought. New York excites me; it gives me lots of energy when I am there. My first two days were very productive and by the end of the day I was eager to return to Hotel 31 to rest. However from the 3rd night on my nightly rest became torture, some agonizing itching forced me to wake up several times through the night. Something was biting me\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 at first I thought\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmosquitoes! I turn the light on, looked around, closed the window and went back to bed. But then again the next night a few hours after getting in bed, this awful feeling would wake me up tormenting me. This time the window had stayed closed, so I decided to do a thorough inspection of the room. I turned pillows in-side-out, turned covers and sheets off the bed, I was enraged, and it became such an obsession to find out what was keeping me from sleeping that I even turned the mattress to the side. And to my surprise I was able to trace little droppings of what appear to be blood\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 bringing me to a little insect hidden on the corner of the wood bed frame. I trapped this little insect with a paper napkin and squeezed it, blood oozed all over the napkin. I was afraid and disgusted. My body had huge swollen red spots every place I got bitten. The swelling and pain lasted more than a week. The very same morning I took photos of the bed and this (bed insect, tick, parasite or whatever it was) and went straight to the front desk. When I show the evidence to the person in charged, immediately took the insect, and in an alarmed manner told me\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6he would have to switch me from room, because they had to fumigate room 711on the 7th floor. But I am not sure if fumigation was actually done, I did not witness any moving or sign posting--otherwise the whole building would have been emptied. Nevertheless, I am still scratching to death traumatized from these nasty bites, and feeling afraid of having brought some of these insects home. Moreover, even though I extended my stay and pay the full price for the weekend no excuses were presented by Hotel 31 on East 31st Street. I am a guest that will never come back.

We quite happily walked down to Soho and back, and up to Central Park and back, perhaps not for everyone, but walking around is the best way to see New York. We ate breakfast every morning at the cafe on the corner of Park Ave and 31st Street, and were always welcomed with open arms there by the lovely staff.

In the rooms, there were a TV, sink, mirror, towels, air conditioner-which is noisy and pretty old-, bedside tables and a chair etc. I didn't see any roaches or bugs. Everything was clean and proper. Bathrooms were also clean. The general atmosphere was very nice. The hotel has a cinematographic and film noir style look which I liked very much. The only thing that I can complain about was the cab driver the receptionist arranged for me to go to JFK airport. It was not a usual yellow cab. The driver asked me more than we spoke with the receptionist. Actually the price that the receptionist asked was already higher than the yellow cabs and at the end we paid extra extra more than the normal price. I was treated as a tourist in a bad way which bothered me of course. I really didn't like it. For the next time in NYC, Hotel 31 won't be at the top of my list only because of this.

I was very pleasantly surprised by the stay. The hotel is very small and I think that as Americans we have become accustomed to sprawling hotels with many areas to relax an so forth. This is a very old building and built for a purpose - to sleep; therefore, the lobby is very tiny and so is the elevator. There are no frills what so ever, but it was not a problem with me. I personally would rather spend my money on dinner, shows or shopping than pay for over priced hotels in the same area. The location is great. 11 short blocks from Grand Central Station and about 1 1/2 blocks to the nearest Subway station. Not sure how many blocks away it is but, from one of the bathroom windows, you could see the Empire State Building. It was illuminated in yellow, blue and green on our visit. There is a great little Sushi restaurant right next door plus a pizza restaurant on the other side with outdoor dining. The wrapped around the corner is a nice little Italian restaurant and a BBQ place across the street (Lexington Ave). One block up is 3rd Ave and we saw several bars/pubs, restaurants. The bathrooms are very tiny and our room was too but I think the sizes vary. Everything was clean and did not have to wait for the bathrooms. I'm happy to report NO bedbugs. However; I did find a large cockroach in the bathtub one night but I've seen cockroaches at expensive hotels before too. ADVICE: I would recommend bringing your own towels as they give you two and are very thin. Also, they only give you 2 pillows for a queen bed so if you like to hug a pillow at night, you might want to bring your own. I never called down but they may have supplied us with one. Also, they offer a car service to the hotel for $55 USD but it only cost $25 USD to LaGuardia at 5:30 Sunday morning. Could be as much ast $30 with more traffic. Never a problem catching a cab out front of hotel either-not even at 5:00 in the morning. If you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a namebrand over-priced hotel and don't care about the amenities, book this hotel. It was a great pleasure to find this place. I cannot wait to go back to NY and I will definitely stay here again. For $93 USD a night, you just cannot beat it. If you have any questions, I would be happy to help.

We are easygoing travellers who often stay at hostels or other basic accommodations - we're aware of the high cost of hotels in NYC, and were expecting nothing more than clean and reasonably maintained accommodations. After the first night, however, we decided we had to request a new room because of the peeling wallpaper, bent venetian blinds, dirty-feeling carpet, and poor lighting. We were moved to a new room the next night. This room was in somewhat better repair, although still quite dingy, and we were ok with it. However, when my mom woke up the next morning she had, much to our disgust, been bitten by a bedbug - there was blood on her nightie and a bite on her skin. I actually managed to capture the engorged bedbug that was crawling on her sheets and stick it to a post-it note, which I gave to the hotel manager the next morning. (It was definitely a bedbug - I have researched the subject for my work as a poverty lawyer in Vancouver.) The manager took the sample bug and said he would get an exterminator in right away and move us to yet another room. He also said that it was important to deal with this because he didn't want it getting on the internet. We were then moved to a very nicely renovated and decorated room on a different floor, totally different in character from either of the two other rooms, which had been quite dark and dingy with poor lighting. However, in this room the telephone was not working - I checked at the front desk and they confirmed that yes, the phone was broken and there was nothing they could/would do about it. Their solution was to give my mother the keys to our original room 4 floors up (the one with broken blinds and peeling wallpaper) so that she could use the phone to call home. The day before we checked out, we indicated we were unhappy with our experience and wanted to speak to a manager before paying our bill. No manager was present during the last 24 hours of our stay and no-one we spoke to seemed to show any concern about the various problems we had been having. So when we checked out we didn't sign for the bill and asked that they not charge our credit card until a manager had called us. We even left a note indicating they were not authorized to charge the card until they had called us, and giving our phone number. Foolishly we did not block the credit card, and it was charged anyway and no-one ever called us!

We looked at hostels initially but then found this hotel at a great price (\u00c2\u00a360 a night for a double room) and in an amazing location on E31st, just three blocks from the Empire State Building and a block and a half from a subway stop on the green line. On arrival we checked in immediately and found our room to be a reasonable size, with a double bed, wardrobe, sink, hairdryer and couple of bedside units. The room had a dated feel to it, with lots of dark wood and old-fashioned wallpaper, but it was very clean (and to be honest we didn't mind the decor in the slightest - it added to the experience). There was a large single window in the room, overlooking a narrow alleyway and a brick wall, but you don't go to New York to look out the window! Bathroom facilities were shared, down the hall, but were immaculately clean. During the week we never had to wait to use them once. The room was also very quiet, and although we were aware of other people on the floor there was hardly any room noise from adjoining rooms or the hallway. Location, as noted above, was great. We were easy walking distance to the Empire State Building and no distance at all from a subway stop. The area around the hotel had plenty of restaurants (try 2nd Avenue Deli on E33rd), convenience stores, a post office, ATMs and internet cafes. There's also a great diner (the Murray Hill diner) a few blocks away that does a breakfast menu at a good price. All in all, the hotel is an absolute bargain, given the location. However, for the avoidance of any doubt, it is worth saying that if you are used to staying in major hotel chains then this will not meet your expectations. On the other hand, if you are used to hostels and small hotels in big cities, or if you just want a safe, clean place to sleep while in New York without paying the earth for it, then you could do a lot worse than Hotel 31.

Each room had a sink which is what you often receive when travelling in Britain. Both rooms had a very small television and one room had a small safe. The view from both rooms was non-existent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a brick wall and a very, very narrow alley. Unfortunately, both rooms were overheated. When we asked if it was possible to lower the temperature we were told to open our windows and the heat would turn off. Not an ideal or efficient solution, but it worked and we were able to have a good night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rest. The bed was a reasonable size and was comfortable and the linens were changed every day. The bathrooms were clean and we did not have to wait. One afternoon someone made an absolute mess of the bathroom (don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask, it was horrible). The dirty bathroom was not the fault of the hotel but an unthoughtful fellow traveler. I reported this to the front desk and they promptly cleaned the bathroom and it remained clean for the rest of our stay. I did have to wait 15 minutes for hot water one morning, but this was not a hardship and did not recur for the duration of our stay. During our stay we received excellent service and found the hotel to be clean, quiet, and centrally located. After checking out, we were allowed to store our luggage for a small fee for most of the afternoon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a nice bonus. Would I stay at Hotel 31 again? Definitely.

Other minor problems included alarm clock not working so i didn't wake up on the first morning when i wanted to and very poor reception on the tv. Also some of the staff were quite surely and unfriendly. The biggest shock however came when i went to check out and was charged an extra $45 for making two international phone calls that lasted between 5 and 6 minutes each. Both calls were to a landline in ireland. I did expect a charge for these and foolishly never checked the cost with reception before ringing.

But When I think 'hotel', I think of some standard amenities. Like a room that isn't the size of a shoebox. Like a dresser for getting your clothes out of your suitcase. Like a shower that has enough water pressure. While our room on the 7th floor was quiet enough, there were a number of glitches that really made me question my $120 a night fee. First, the air conditioner sounded like a turbo-prop engine during takeoff, so keeping it on for longer than 5 minutes was impossible. Second, the tired and worn towels looked like they were castoffs from another hotel (close inspection revealed this to be true). Third, the shower really did have no water pressure, and ran scalding hot (if you can believe it) for the first morning.

The hotel suited all of our needs, and we were very pleased with the choice. We paid around \u00c2\u00a360 a night for a room with a private bathroom, which was much cheaper than the average going rate for hotels in the same area. The room was a decent size (not huge, but more than big enough for the two of us, and our week's worth of luggage/shopping), and the bathroom was clean and spacious; we were very comfortable the whole time. The private bathroom was a personal preference of ours, but as many people have commented before, the shared bathrooms that we passed on our floor were always empty and very clean (I must mention though that the hotel was rather quiet the whole time we were there, so this may not necessarily be the case in a busier season). The location of the hotel was perfect for what we required. We were making a few day trips out of the city from Penn Station, and as this involved a few early mornings/late returns, one of the main reasons for our choosing Hotel 31 was it's proximity to the station. It was about fifteen minutes walk and this, combined with the price, made it ideal. The hotel is also located only five minutes from 5th Avenue (and the Empire State Building) and about 20 minutes from Times Square, while there are plenty of subway links from either 33rd Street or Penn Station. There was a large Loews cinema just two blocks away on Second Avenue, and plenty of restaurants in the nearby areas. The hotel is in a quiet area of the city; we generally found ourselves walking back to the hotel at about 11pm from either seeing a show or the station, and the surrounding streets were practically deserted. This didn't bother my boyfriend, though I admit I preferred to stick to the major avenues like 5th or Madison late at night. One thing we did find a little odd came at the very end of our stay: after asking one of the front desk staff about a car back to Newark, we were told we could book one with them for $50. Our flight home wasn't until 10pm, so we left our luggage at the hotel after checking out in order to have a last day wandering around. On returning, our luggage was returned to us by a member of staff, who then announced that he would be taking us to the airport himself in a cab that was waiting outside the hotel; he then proceeded to tell us that outside of working at the hotel, he also worked as a cab driver! We were a bit confused by the whole situation, but as the staff had seemed generally eccentric (though very helpful and pleasant) throughout our stay, we decided it was better to just accept it and be on our way...we made it to the airport quickly and in one piece, so everything worked out in the end! All in all, I strongly recommend Hotel 31 for anyone who is looking for a cheap, well located hotel in Manhattan.

The room was a decent size (twin - no bath) for New York at least. An excellent location in midtown manhatten. Walking distance to great sites such as the UN, Empire State, Times Square, Grand Central Terminal, Fifth Ave, Macy's etc. Also, the subway is a couple minutes walk which was great for convenience. There's also some good local amenities like a grocery store, internet cafe and cheap lunch and dinner places. The area is somewhat commercial so is pretty quiet in the evenings and weekends and more lively during weekday mornings and afternoons when all the office workers are getting to work or on lunch. Lexington ave and third ave which are right next to the hotel have some decent places to eat and drink if you're looking for a relatively quiet night out near by. The hotel staff were friendly and approachable and can offer great help with local information like directions, local sites, where to get something to eat etc. The hotel itself is quite cute and quirky in the decorations and style. Yes the elevator is small and slow but I laughed everytime I rode it because it was such a quirky old-school thing. The bedrooms are kept clean and tidy by the maids - remember to tip them - we tipped $5 a day as a rule. Our bedroom had a television and phone and couple of rails to put clothes. This was actually more than we were expecting There were a couple of occasions where there was a wait for the bathroom - this was at peak times in the morning - say about 9am when everyone was just up - so to be expected really. And there were also a couple of times when the toilets would be blocked up - but a quick ring to tell reception about it sorted this out soon enough.

In general, all hotels in Manhattan are outrageously expensive. I was shocked when I first started looking for a place to stay because it seemed impossible to find anywhere half decent for under \u00c2\u00a3150 (about USD300) a night. Call me a cheapskate but I consider that to be expensive!! I just couldn't believe this and even posted a forum question asking why this was? I had a lot of responses from local experts basically saying that hotels in Manhattan can charge what they like nowadays and it's almost a license to print money. Anyway, after a lot of searching and review reading, I went for Hotel 31 because of the ***comparatively*** cheaper price of \u00c2\u00a3100 (USD200) per night and it's ideal and central location....and, to be quite honest, it's high star rating on Trip Advisor for what essentially appeared to be a budget hotel. I won't bore you with a long and overly descriptive review of the actual place itself but all you need to know is: OUR SITUATION: We had a double bed room with a private bathroom on the 8th floor and paid about \u00c2\u00a3300 (exact USD588) for three nights. Disappointed not to have a view of the ESB but didn't think to ask for one when we checked in. If this is important to you, you might want to make a point of requesting one when you're checking in! Points I'd like to make: LOCATION: 1) Yes, the location IS fantastic, a few blocks from the ESB, two blocks from either 28th or 33rd Street Subway stations (that take you directly right downtown to Liddle-Iddly and Chinatown etc :) and unless you are infirm, you can walk to most popular Manhattan locations within 30-odd minutes. HOTEL ITSELF: 2) Yes, the rooms are on the small side and look a bit 'tired', the aircon unit is loud and will keep you awake if you need 'pindrop silence' to sleep and to be perfectly honest, the place as a whole is really nothing 'special'. You get all the usual amenities though, like a multi-channel TV, coffee machine, iron, alarm clock etc. You have a maid option every day and the place was kept clean and tidy and maintained. Although we had no need for them, the shared bathrooms looked well maintained as well. Yes, cleanliness couldn't be faulted in general. The deskstaff are friendly enough and we had no problems at all with them. We liked the musical lift/elevator (plays radio music) that's like something from the 1930's, that seemed to take forever to get from the top (8th) floor to the Ground!! :) It was quite quaint really... GENERAL: Here's the thing though. Unless you're royalty, when you go to NY, why the hell would you need anything more than something like Hotel 31?!? Even though I'm from the UK, I'm happy to go on record as saying that NY is the greatest city I've ever been to (now been 3 times) with sooooooo much to see and do that if you spend any more time in your hotel room than sleeping and washing, I tell you, you're cheating yourself!!! Why pay anymore than 'as little as you can' for somewhere to rest your head, that's clean, reasonably comfortable and central? In this respect, Hotel 31 is ideal and from what I've seen, probably the best place in Manhattan in this category. Sure, if you've got money to burn, I'm sure there are far more luxurious places to stay and if you can afford \u00c2\u00a3200/\u00c2\u00a3250 a night for a hotel, then good for you but most of us mere mortals can't so that why I'd recommend this place. SUMMARY: So there you have it. Hotel 31. Cheap and cheerful, great location, know what to expect, don't go with any delusions of grandeur and this place is absolutely ideal! I'd certainly stay there again unless I win the lottery and for a city that seems to be getting ever more expensive, every penny counts!!! :)", "Date": "September 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "H.

The hotel is close to a lot of attractions and amenities such as the Empire State Building, Times Square, Broadway theatres, subways, decent restaurants, shopping, etc. You can even go to the rooftop for some great views of the Empire State Building. The staff is friendly and helpful. Cons: The rooms are small and cramped and really outdated. I picked up a copy of the hotel's brochure in the lobby and it claims be be newly renovated but I guess that must have been printed back in the 1980's. The wallpaper in our room (#603) was really gross and had a mysterious white stain running down it. The rooms and hallways are very dark and bleak. The shared bathrooms were always fairly clean but the fixtures are extremely outdated and at one point when I was showering the cold water stopped working and wasn't fixed for a couple of days.

We knew what to expect and were pleased overall with the experience. We arrived in the city around 11AM and were able to check into our room right away. On first impression, it's an older building but clean and well-maintained. The elevator is older and requires a pull gate. Our room had a double bed, nightstand, lamp, sink, desk, chair, clock, hairdryer and tv. There is no ironing board or iron. The shared bath was rarely busy and kept pretty clean. The sheets on our bed smelled of bleach (which is always comforting). The towels are rather thin and sparse. There is a window A/C unit and it kept the small room pretty cool. Overall, for the $110 a night we paid for it, it was exactly what we needed. It's located on a residential street, so it was always super quiet and in a VERY safe area. We parked the car on the street a block over on 30th for 3 days and it was free and perfectly fine. It's only 2 blocks from the 33rd and Park Ave subway stop and lots of conveniences around too (Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, Cosi, etc).

The bed was comfy, yet the pillows a bit too stiff for our tastes; however, the bathroom was clean, we had hot water for our morning shower & warm for right before bed, plenty of towels and space for our clothes. The wallpaper was kooky and the room was unbelievably quiet for NYC. The only negative was the light right outside our window highlighting the tip of the hotel. The room had dark-red mini blinds; however, the room was not as dark as we would have liked during sleep hours. The AC, which cooled perfectly, was typically old and loud, so you needed earplugs for that. I should add where we live (Germany) we don't have AC, so it's probably a noise most Americans are used to. The hotel does not have a restaurant, but it is located between Park & Lexington Aves, so there were plenty of breakfast & dinner places to chose from. Also, it's only 2 blocks from the green line metro, a few blocks from the Empire State Bldg. & you have an unobstructed view of the Chrysler Bldg. from the corner of 31st and Lexington Ave., which at night is lovely! Also, if you arrive into Penn Station, you can save a few bucks on a taxi & walk the 10 minutes eastward on 31st directly to the hotel.

Nearby in a local shop that sells all the normal junk food and some great cakes. The reception is always staffed which is handy as well as being safe. The people that work there were always very helpful and even booked us the taxi (car) for the way back to the airport. The lift to the room was a strange affair. You need to open the door to get in and open the Iron Gate. As soon as you close the outside door the Iron Gate will close itself. When you get out you need to open both but the Iron Gate will stay open itself until the outside door is closed. The room was booked as a en-suit double room. It actually had a single bed in there too, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make any difference. The room was clean and actually pretty big.

Only 20% of the rooms have their own restroom. Most are shared facilities. Make sure you ask for a room with a view, as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re close to the Empire so you might get some great views.

After a long day travelling we were swiftly checked in and directed to our room on the sixth floor. As many of the other reviews have indicated the lift was an interesting experience but added to the character of the place. We managed to get 4 adults and 5 suitcases up in two runs so the lift isn't extremely tiny. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean. Although the wardrobe space was probably more suitable for 1 or 2 people we were okay with living out of our suitcases for a week. ( when you're in New York you don't spend much time in your room anyway!) We had a nosey around the shared bathrooms and these also seemed to be very clean and well-maintained. The maid service was in every day and was very good. The location of the hotel is excellent. Five minutes walk from Empire State, Macy's and Madison Square Gardens. Time's Square is about 10-15 mins walk. We got a taxi back from Broadway which cost about $10 including tip and the higher night tarriff. If you are arriving late or just fancy a snack, I would thoroughly recommend the deli at the end of the street at Lexington Ave. It's open 24 hours and the staff are lovely. Hotel 31 is an excellent budget hotel. If you are looking for luxury and plan on spending a lot of time in your hotel, this isn't for you.

I give the towels poor marks; someone said postage stamp size. If things like towel size are decision makers for you, you are going to need to spend $300 or so a night for an adequate room in NY-my sister was staying at the Intercontinental Barclay-she called it just adequate but I thought it was quite lovely.

So we ended up walking around the area (the hotel is in an excellent location, and very close to the Park and 33st station, and even to Penn Station) and doing lots of touristy things to pass time. After checking in, we tried the elevator for the novelty factor, but ended up being too cumbersome so we just used the stairs as we were on the second floor. We were not surprised by the size of the room; the two of us could put in all our luggage and other items and have plenty of room to move around. We didn't have a view in our window, which was fine because after our 5am excursion, sleep was the only thing on our minds and we didn't want anything to keep us awake! The AC ws very handy, as it was very humid in NYC. It was always nice to come back to a cleaned and cool room. The hotel is in a very nice area- not so far away is the Empire State Building, across the street from a laundromat, many restaurants (our favorite was Todai, an all you can eat Japanese restaurant located on 6 E 32 st), 2 streets down from the Garment District, a 99 cent store/bargain store, and Manhattan Mall. 33st/Park is easily accesible from the hotel and a taxi ride to Penn Station cost us 4.50$ If you need ideas of what to do on your trip, the lobby, although small, has tons of brochures available and you can even pick up the New York City Guide Book on the reception desk- it has several seperate free maps of the city and the bus and subway system. As with the other reviews, we had no trouble with the shared bathrooms. We rarely saw the other guests, but late one night there was a really strange (and vugar!) shouting match going on down the hall, but we never experienced that again. Overall, we had a great time in New York and I'm extremely pleased that the quality and location of the hotel could add to our NYC experience.", "Date": "July 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calagry", "Title": "\u201cCaution Reservation not honoured\u201d", "Author": "CalagryJusthelping", "ReviewID": "UR5432966", "Content": "Had previously stayed at a sister property Hotel 17 and found it to be adequate we decided to be a little closer to the action and booked Hotel 31 through Travelocity. We planned to stay over the Easter long weekend and were traveling in from Washington DC. A representative from Travelocity had phoned us the day before telling us there was a problem with the reservation so we called them back and were told everything was fine they had called the hotel and the reservation was there. We arrived at the hotel about noon and gave them our name and booking number only to be told the reservation would not be honoured because they were \"sold out\". We booked this reservation more than two months in advance and guaranteed it with a credit card number and received a confirmation #. Had we not shown up we were told the credit card would have been charged the first nights stay because it was \"guaranteed\". After talking to the Hotel 31 manager we were told there were no rooms available all weekend but that we could have a room at Hotel 17 for the night and then \"were on our own\". He said he was only honouring reservations that were prepaid because he would be responsible for paying for alternate accommodations if he didn't. Apparently having a credit card guarantee and confirmation number was not sufficient for him. We then phoned Travelocity who told us they \"couldn't believe the reservation wasn't being honoured\" because we had a confirmation number and gave the manager our cell phone to talk to the Travelocity representative. They went back and forth arguing for about 10 minutes at which point he gave the cell phone back. He said he \"didn't care if Travelocity dropped him and... there must be another hotel room in New York somewhere\". We left for Hotel 17 and when we got there were again told we could only have 1 night and would then be on our own. We asked if there were any hotels in the area and were told we could \"go for a walk and see\". This was Easter Long Weekend and of course anything good and/or well priced was long gone so we worked with Travelocity to find a place at more then double the cost but just to continue our vacation. As a result Travelocity has filed a claim against this Hotel chain and dropped them for their system. We were lucky because we arrived early and could find something else but this happened to 13 other people that same day the manager claimed. Obviously this is a common practice to overbook and hope everyone doesn't show up but it's not like you can just catch the next flight! There is no room you are on the street! I wouldn't take the risk of getting bumped and would book a reputable chain in the future just to save the hastle and time spent dealing with Hotel31/17 staff. The manager at Hotel 31 was rude, arrogant and completely unhelpful and I can't believe his cavalier attitude to reservations!

The location of this Hotel is second to none, 4 blocks away from the Empire State building and Macy's and many more attractions. In fact pretty much everthing is within walking distance, which I have got to say is definetly the main draw to this hotel. Checking in took all of 2 minutes and we then went up to our room, this can be difficult if like me you have a giant case as the elevator is very small; but we managed to squeeze in ok. The room we first had was a double room, not a big drama, but we would have preferred a twim room, we went down to ask if there were any twin rooms available, but there wasn't any that night. However in the morning we asked again and for only another 30 dollars we were moved. The first room was very small for a double and both were perhaps a bit dated, and from both rooms there was no view and no daylight fom the windows. We had to have a light on the whole time we were in the room, not a big problem though as we were not often in the room. Both rooms had air conditioning which you will need as the humidity was unreal. Maids came daily and changed the towels and made the beds. The shared bathrooms are fine and always clean. One main detterant to revisiting this hotel was the smell. When we were moved to the third floor when you open the door to the main corridor there is an unmistakable smell of urine, and then as you walk down the corridor it smells like an old folks home. Both myself and my Aunt noticed this, there was no smell on the second floor, just the third? Upon checking out we could leave our cases behind reception and they even phoned and booked a taxi for us. As said the best thing about this hotel was its location, the staff were helpful and all in all our stay at this hotel was good, so I would recommend staying here if like me your not in your room that much and you are not really bothered about anyting I have mentioned above. However if your going to new York and are used to a bit more luxury from a Hotel then I would recommend spending a bit more and trying something else. To be truthful if I was going again I think I would probably spend a bit more and go somewhere else as there are loads of hotels to chose from in the central area. We had a really great time In New York and probably only saw a fraction of it due to there being so much to do. We went up the Empire State Building on a Friday night as on Fri Sat and Sun it is opened til 0200 and at that time there was no queue at all and we walked around at our leisure, also the skyline at night is something else, the next day however we passed it and the queue was out the buiding and around the corner. We bought a ticket from a vendor for the Gray Line, it is an open top double decker that drives around Manhattan with a tour guide, tickets are really reasonable and you can hop on and off at your leisure and you get a bit of info as you drive about. I would definetly recommend this.", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cGood budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "drdfsdaz", "ReviewID": "UR5227957", "Content": "Hotel 31 is very well located to see the city and the price for NYC is good.

The shared bathroom was never a problem and again was small but functional. Being on the 8th floor I was very grateful for the elevator which was quite a \"period piece\" and had genuine \"elevator music\" playing all the time: it all added to the atmosphere and experience though :-) There are no restaurant/dining facilities but there is a deli on the corner that seems to sell everything and stays open all hours.

Everything- the lobby, the room, the bathroom- was very clean. Furnishings are a bit worn, but in working order. Of course the elevator is small, but it works fine. For such a cheap price, I was impressed that we had cable TV, a clock radio, a sink in the room, and very cold AC. We never had to wait for the bathroom.

You're within walking distance of the NY Public Library and its adjacent Bryant Park too. The area also seems reasonably safe--we never worried about going out at night. There's also tons of ethnic food in the area--Indian, Vietnamese, Korean within a three to five block radius. The second reason to stay here is the quiet. We faced a courtyard the first night and found it incredibly noisefree for NYC. The first two nights we had a room with a private bath; the last night we had a room with a shared bath. The room w/private bath had far more space, although the tub was one of the smallest I've seen in the States. Even the TV was larger in this room. The room w/shared bath was fine too. The shared bath was clean and never seemed to require any attention.

Having said that there was adequate room to be comfortable, so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a big issue. Bathroom was perfect, cleaned every day, as was the room. Although we had our own on-suite, I rarely saw the shared bathrooms occupied, and they too were spotless. There was always hot water and we were supplied with towels (but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to use the shared bathrooms, there weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any supplied). Secondly, we found the staff to be really helpful and pretty friendly. When we arrived, the guy on the desk kept us chatting for ages! The service was fine, they had all our details so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the lack of organisation that some have commented on in this forum. The hotels location itself is outstanding with the 33rd st. subway entrance about 3 minutes walk away, there are plenty of little coffee shops and grocery stores in the immediate vicinity, and I have to recommend \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cosi\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd-a coffee shop on the corner of 31st and Park Ave. Brilliant spot for breakfast and fast, friendly service. Some have complained on these pages about the static electricity in the hotel-and yep its there alright! But to be honest, given the location, cleanliness and price it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small fault-just pull down your sleeves to open the doors!!! How hard is that?? Also, yes, the lift IS small (and slow), but again, c\u00e2\u20ac\u2122mon, how much of an issue is that? Its not as if you came to New York to see a lift!! We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a view from our room but again, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning on spending my week staring out of a hotel window! If the lift and window issues really bother you-then you obviously don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have that much else to worry about!! The hotel is in a safe location and is pretty quiet at night, save for the odd siren in the distance. But after a full day sightseeing and shopping in the city, I guarantee you wont hear anything until your alarm goes off in the morning! Speaking of which, they provided a clock-radio which was a nice touch! TV was fine, good few channels, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t watch much though. If you are intent on watching films, there is a cinema about 3 or 4 blocks down, walking east from the hotel all the way along 31st street. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember the name exactly, (think it might be Lowes Kips Bay at 570 second avenune at 31st street) but just keep walking along 31st street in an Easterly direction for about 10-12mins and you cant miss it!

I have to say we will not be staying in Hotel 31 again. We had no problems with our reservations, receiving a double private bathroom on the seventh floor with a view of the Empire state building (if you stuck your neck out the bathroom window) Firstly * the lift was tiny and always occupied. On arrival and departure it was extremely difficult for us to fit in the lift with our luggage. The door/gate situation is a joke, it's very awkward. * The static electricity was horrible. Maybe it was just us, but we had to use our feet to try to open the hall doors. * The 'romantic red blinds' that were mentioned...not romantic at all. They did not block out any light. As i am a light sleeper I was awoken at 5.30 by a combination of sunlight and the dawn chorus of sirens. Have these people not heard of double glazing?? * The crazy old man at the front desk was not 'cute' or 'charming'. More like very irritating. He made comments about me to my boyfriend which i did not appreciate. * On our first stay there the toilet got blocked. I was surprised to find the same thing occurred on our second stay there. A coincidence?? I think not. Not a pleasant experience. * Our bed had just enough room to fit the two of us, but that was it . It was tiny! And the mattress was v. hard and uncomfortable. As we stayed seven nights on this mattress, our backs were very sore. The situation with the bedcovers was farcical. We had one sheet, a bedspread and some kind of foam-type of cover, which had a huge hole burnt in it. I also felt that the linen was not changed on a regular basis, as I came out in a rash and felt itchy in the bed. * I would not say that the hotel has been renovated in a while. The wallpaper is peeling, the carpet coming away from the wall. On a more positive note, the location is fantastic, I couldn't recommend this part of Manhattan more. The subway is less than two minutes walk away and you're close to everything.

It's in a great location - a short walk from a lot of the things you'd want to see, entry to the 6 train (local Lexington Ave service) is less than 5 minutes away (there's an entry to the 33St station on the corner of 32nd and Park Ave). We walked to just about everywhere from the Hotel - a few blocks over to Chelsea, few blocks up to Times Square. The neighbourhood seems extremely safe and surprisingly quiet. The lift is cute - and will fit four people in with bags (well I guess that depends on the people and the bags - but it is doable). The shared bathroom was clean throughout the stay. Only had to wait twice and on one of those occasions was because the staff were cleaning it. On most floors there are two bathrooms - so you can easily use one on the other side or indeed on another floor if you can't wait. The rest of the hotel was also clean, and the room was also cleaned each day. The room has a TV that carries quite a few TV channels like WB, CNN, Cinemax, Fox 5 and a movie channel. There were also a couple of spanish/mexican channels but the reception was poor on those. Basically enough channels to keep you entertained for the short periods you'll be in the room and enough news/weather channels to let you plan your day. The room also had a sink so you can always freshen up if the bathroom is busy. Points to consider. We stayed on the 7th Floor of 8 (for us on the wrong side to have a view of the Empire State but you could see it from the other bathroom on the floor). The room was small. Just enough room for the double bed and a small chest of drawers. We were a couple so wasn't really a problem being 'on top of each other' so to speak. The room was clean but a little old looking and the drawers a little on there last legs. But it was ok. The bathrooms whilst always kept clean were a little old looking and the wear and tear was starting to show - but not so much as you wouldn't want shower in there, and considering the volume of people using it they were good - but don't expect a showroom bathroom. The water pressure was a little on the poor side - so don't expect a power shower but the water was always hot. If you are after a cheap place to stay that is safe and clean, close to all that you could want but not in the thick of the action as to be a distraction then choose this place.

If you're a heavy sleeper and noise doesn't bother you, I can't think of a reason why you shouldn't stay here. But if noise is at all an issue for you, I would recommend you consider staying somewhere else. The three nights I stayed here, I spent the first two staying awake due to the tv, conversation, and constantly slamming doors of my next door neighbors - who of course had many people coming by their room until 5:10am. After a second night of this, I asked the front desk if I could move to a quieter room and they put me on the 7th floor, where I didn't have any guests next to me. This was acceptable, but also a matter of luck; if they were all booked or if they had more people on that floor, I might not have had much of a change noise-wise.

Little Korea is a five minute stroll from there (there's an Internet cafe in Little Korea that charges $2 per hour, in case you're interested). Hotel 31's immediate vicinity is clean and safe.

In fact, the experience kind of reminded me of how I would use my own house's bathroom. How much time do most single, young people spend in the washroom in a typical day anyhow? The hotel obviously has a round-the-clock cleaning schedule, because the washroom was always clean whenever I used it. There is also a sink and hair dryer in your room, so it was really convenient in the AMs (I'm a guy, so all I do is shave and dry my washed hair).
