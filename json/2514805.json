We chose it based on Tripadvisor reviews and loved it! Cedric upgraded us to a tower view room which made an already romantic trip even more so. Eiffel Tower is a four minute walk and metro station is probably five minutes. Hotel breakfast is rather expensive at 14 euros, so we had complementary coffee and walked two minutes to a pastry shop each morning. Our room was spotless and hotel staff were all very nice. They will offer advice on restaurants, metros, taxis etc. Our room was small as we expected, but you don't go to Paris to stay in the room.

The staff spoke English well and we really appreciated the communication before our actual arrival to assist with transportation from the airport and restaurant/cabaret reservations and recommendations.

As a result, we really felt like the staff knew who we were which added a personalized feel to our stay. There's no restaurant, but a very cheerful woman serves a nice breakfast in the morning (though it's not a hot breakfast so if you want eggs, etc. go somewhere else). We loved the location - the hotel is right by the Eiffel Tower and Rue Cler (a great street with bakeries, cafes, etc.) and about a 6 minute walk to the nearest Metro. You can take a leisurely walk up the Seine or a quick Metro ride to get to the other main tourist sites (Louvre, Notre-Dame, Saint-Chapelle, etc.).

They came in from outside of the hotel with a couple of croissants. That's it. I could have gone out myself sooner. The maids also started arguing with the hotel clerk. All this for 14 euros each. I strongly suggest you get breakfast somewhere else. We had a more expensive Pavillion room. Still very small feeling for an upgraded room. I thought the renovations were very beautiful.

Our last three stays in Paris (within the last 5 years and this one included) have been in the 7th district, but in three different hotels. Considering price and comfort+hotel looks, this is my favorite so far! Rue Augereau is a quiet street with hardly any vehicles passing through; it has a couple of laundromats, tailoring/alterations shops, and a grocery store (back entrance) all near the hotel. The nearest Metro stop is Ecole Militaire, which is about 5-7 minutes leisurely walk away--we arrived via train from the south of France, then took the Metro. Even with luggage, it was no hassle at all walking to Hotel Londres. There's a pastry shop right across the hotel, a nice resto right beside it (we didn't eat there, but it was always full), another at the nearest corner, and a dozen or so fantastic dining options (we ate at a couple of those) along Rue Saint Dominique and Rue de l'Exposition... all less than two minutes walking after rounding the corner of Augereau and Saint Dominique. The park Champs de Mars, Eiffel Tower, and Pont de l'Alma (where you can catch Seine cruises) are all within convenient distance (10-15 minutes no-rush walking). Our hotel room (standard Paris size) was on the 3rd floor, had lovely wallpaper, alcoves in lieu of bedside tables, a console, one closet with hangers and another with shelves, and a good sized window with pretty drapes and flowers outside. There's no safe and no bathtub, but the shower has the rain-type fixture and a separate handheld one. Full length mirror on the bathroom door, and yes, there's a hair dryer. All the staff (from front desk to housecleaning) are friendly, courteous, and pleasant. Cedric, at the desk, arranged our dinner river cruise for us and gave the hubby some assistance with dining reservations even prior to our arrival (via email exchange with him). Books may be borrowed from the hotel's collection (a whole wall in the dining area is lined with bookshelves), and you may bring the books to your room... except the very-much-in-demand Rick Steves guide books, which you must read/browse in the dining room or lobby.

Don't even think about maybe a night snack there. You are not allowed to eat there except if you pay for their breakfast. We had to hide our snacks and then throw them away wrapped up to hide it in our rooms. I would guess they must have a rodent problem? I did not see any but can not think of any other reason? I have stayed at hotels all over the world and have never been told this before. Felt like I was in a hostel. Also I hear they have large rooms. Ours was a match box which I know is normal for Paris but there was no room to put luggage. They have these little closet things to \"hold\" your luggage. My daughter and I had the size just over a carry on and they would not fit in these. Half the room was taken up by a fridge which I have no idea why it is there since you can not bring food into your room? Because there was no room for our suitcases we had to put them in the very tiny space in front of our beds. You had to step over them to get to the other side of the bed. One day the owner told me as I was leaving. (You had to turn in your key each time) that I had to put all my stuff away because the maids were having trouble cleaning the room. We did not have any thing out but the suitcases and our bathroom stuff out. So each day we had to put everything and I mean everything packed up and away so they would then clean the room. I was afraid to see her each time we came back for fear we would have done something else wrong and get in trouble. Again I felt like I was in a hostel.

The bathroom was bright, clean, and had a nice assortment of soaps, shampoos, etc. We also made full use of the wall mounted towel warmer (not because we needed to, but rather, because we had never seen one before...I now want one!) The room and bath were kept spotlessly clean during our stay. There was a TV mounted on the wall and reading lights over the bed, too. The Hotel is located on a tiny side street in a quaint neighborhood, with small businesses, restaurants, and caf\u00e9s all around, and really gave us the feeling of living in Paris that we had imagined. The Eiffel Tower is literally less than 5 minute walk down the street. Of course, it took us longer because we couldn't walk past the wonderful bakeries and shops without stopping in! After long busy days of sightseeing, shows, dining, and shopping, we actually looked forward to heading back to the hotel to relax and \"be in Paris\"! Kudos to Isabelle and her staff for making our stay one of the highlights of our European vacation!

First of all, you can definitely walk to many of the key sights in Paris from here. Second, if you just want to stroll the quaint streets of this tourist friendly neighborhood, you just hang a right from the hotel and you are easily just steps away from a convenience store, market, creperie, atm machine, etc. Last but definitely not least, the hotel is just a 2 minute stroll from the Eiffel Tower and the Champ Du Mars park which we highly recommend you walk through after an espresso across the street! The rooms are \"par for the course\" when it comes to its dimensions but they are definitely cozy enough to make your nights memorable. Hotel staff was just outstanding. They will do whatever it takes to enhance your Parisian experience! Arnaud specifically would greet us each morning with a smile and would take the time to help us plan our days. He was always patient enough to explain to us how to access the nearest metro without rolling his eyes and would even suggest a restaurant or two! Our visit to this hotel was during a lull in tourist season so hotel management was nice enough to upgrade us to a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower itself and that just simply put our experience over the top!

My room was ready at 9:30am, perfect after an overnight flight. Charming lobby, welcoming staff, delicious breakfast buffet, and charming breakfast area. The breakfast had fresh fruit, ham, cheese, yogurt, fresh juices and amazing bagettes and croissants....yum! (I am still trying to figure out why the food is that much better in Paris. WOW!!) The breakfast staff actually sing a little tune while they work...sweet! Cute \"hotel\" dog, Samba, with her little bed in the lobby fireplace area. The hotel is in the perfect location (7th arrondisment), near everything this nice little neighborhood needs; laundry across the street, supermarket a block away (water and snacks), amazing pastry shop a block in the other direction, bus #69 about 2-blocks away, Rue Cler neighborhood shopping area and market 5-blocks, perfect little restaurants within a few blocks walk, Eiffel Tower about 10-blocks, metro 5-blocks, and about 5 blocks to the Seine. Bus 69 takes you to all the other sites in town, so this bus-stop is perfectly located near the hotel. My \"single Poet's room\" (#25) was small but lovely, with a modern bathroom, great shower and a wonderful bed. The view was in the back of the hotel, and it was quiet. The walls were actually padded, which is something you usually don't see in a smaller hotel like this. All of the staff were quite helpful in every way; Arnaud, Patrice, Cedric, etc. I am already planning on a trip for next spring and will definitely include another visit to Paris and this fine lovely hotel.

Use the RER if your going to Versailles. The hotel is very clean, the rooms a little small compared to American standards, but if you travel at all in Europe you know this is standard. Free Wifi in the hotel with good coverage. I was on the 2nd floor (3rd in USA) and getting 54 Mbps. 30 feet away from hotel is a laundry-mat. So nice to be able to clean my clothes without having to dry them in the room. Bit of a learning curve to use the automated controls but doable. Plenty of nice restaurants around the hotel with one of the most popular being the Cafe Constant just a few yards away. Extremely popular, with 30-40 minute wait times starting 8pm on. Get their early 6-7pm to avoid the large wait times. Everyone who ate there (in our group) raved about the food. Lots of other nice cafes, bistros and higher end restaurants in the surrounding blocks. Nice store for grocery items (wine) and for getting toothpaste, etc just half a block away. The only real problem I had with the hotel was their breakfast. Very basic with a diced fruit bowl, yogurt and cereal. Great coffee though. No eggs and no way to toast your bread. Only protein was cheese or sliced salami or ham tray. The same every day, but I found that the French are not big breakfast eaters anyway. I have no problem recommending this hotel for you stay. The staff are very friendly and helpful, with great location and amenities nearby, its hard to beat. Note to use the laundry-mat, always type in the machine number first then enter you money. For soap dispenser enter in 44 then one euro coin and wait for the box to dispense. Decide on the washer size (small or large), use all the soap and fill both sides equally. Put your clothes in, select time (30 to 95 minutes) then go back to control box type in you washer number and put in the money. Same for the dryer. Couldn't be easier...

It sits on a quiet street and you have a bakery, supermarket, laundry, metro stops and plenty of restaurants with a block or so of the hotel. You are within 5 minutes of the Eiffel Tower which makes it nice to end the evening with a bottle of wine and watch the lights on the Eiffel Tower. While everything met French standards, the rooms are small as compared to American standards, but very adequate for your stay since you spend most of your time away from the hotel. I like this hotel very much and would recommend it to friends and will stay there again. If your are in doubt, stay here. Say hello to Cedric, he's an institution there.

The service from the front desk staff was very good, and they were always ready to help with anything. Comprehension of English varied from excellent to good. The reception area was still being finished - it presently has a wooden floor, which makes that area, and the lounge it incorporates, and the breakfast room off it, noisy - a problem compounded by the breakfast wait staff talking with each other very loudly, sometimes yelling, which wasn't conducive to a pleasant start to the day. Against that, however, breakfast was always served promptly and was of good quality. There was a computer in the reception area available for guests, but the keyboard is French, and although you can switch the computer language/keyboard to English, of course the physical marks on the keyboard don't change, so you need to remember where all the punctuation and some of the letters are on an English version - the European arrangement marked on the keyboard is quite different. On some sites, like gmail, the computer had a habit of resetting to French once you sent anything, so you have to keep checking. Given that the vast majority of guests at this hotel were English-speaking, perhaps the hotel might consider installing an English keyboard, or having wireless keyboards, one for European and one for English that could be easily swapped. The room - we had a pavilion room in the annexe at the back - was very comfortable and large enough (for Paris) with plenty of hanging space, a drawer and good shelves in the wardrobe, along with a small fridge for personal use (nothing in it except what you might put in it). The bathroom was a treat - far bigger than I'd expected, all new and shining, fully tiled, large walk-in shower with sliding glass door and excellent shower heads and water pressure. The bed was comfy and the pillows good. They also had multiple accessible power points for charging phones and devices, and also free wireless throughout, a big plus. The air-conditioner worked well and there was a large, openable window to the courtyard. At night the area was very quiet, ensuring easy rest. The premier feature of this hotel is its location. The area is perfect for reaching all the main sights easily, be it the Eiffel Tower five minutes walk away, or Versailles by the RER, about five minutes brisk walk to that station. The metro is about 5 mins the other way. Rue Cler is a few blocks away, and every street, including the one the hotel is on, has numerous good restaurants - easy to eat well without ranging far. We had friends who were simutaneously staying at a very nice hotel in the Latin Quarter, where the night life was very lively and the restaurants even more plentiful, but the noise through the night kept them awake - we had no such problems as the area of the Londres-Eiffel is essentially mid-to-upper level residental. The old buildings in the streets around Champs du Mars are lovely - and pricey - so no noisy students to disturb your rest. I have only two quibbles about this hotel - the first being the noisiness of the reception area, even when there are few people there. One can only hope they are going to re-carpet soon, which will immediately solve the problem. My second quibble arises because of the predominance of tour groups (Rick Steve's tours, I believe), and the fact that the hotel has no adequate space to house their necessary meetings. This resulted in us having to tip-toe our way, trying to be unobtrusive, which was utterly impossible, straight through group meetings on multiple occasions just to get from the front door to our room. That was not comfortable for either us or the tour group and their leaders. The hotel management needs to address this issue because it mars an otherwise excellent experience, and the location, location, location can't be beat.", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Katonah, New York", "Title": "\u201cClean, comfortable hotel with helpful staff in very nice area\u201d", "Author": "katonahkid", "ReviewID": "UR107282752", "Content": "We stayed a week at this hotel and we found the rooms to be clean, the bathrooms very nice, but the lack of space surprised us - however we understand it is not unusual for Paris. More on that later. The location is excellent. There are many restaurant choices just outside the hotel entrance, including one Michelin rated - so if you are tired after a long day of sightseeing you don't have to go far for a very good meal. There are a lot of appealing shops just outside, plus many more a few minutes away on Rue Cler. Rue Cler has a lot of food offering and many shops and restaurants. One of my favorite things was buying bread, chocolate, cheese, wine and pastries and enjoying them when we wanted. There are also convenient stores nearby, so if you need picnic things or bottled water, it's right outside your door too. We also enjoyed getting pastry for breakfast in nearby shops - it was a real treat. If you look you will find some that also sell tea and coffee (caf\u00e9 au lait for me). As far as transportation goes, it's a little less than a 10 minute walk to the Metro or the RER (the latter is the way to Versailles as well as Notre Dame and Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay area). There are buses even closer, but this being our first trip here I spent more time on the trains because I was more confident there. However if you want to take public transportation to the Arc de Triomphe area - the bus is the way. You are also a short walk from the Eiffel Tower and the Seine (where you can begin a river cruise which I recommend), but we found the Eiffel Tower area to be more like Times Square (I work in NYC), with tourists all over the place and people selling junk. We also never climbed the Tower because of the crowds, and we heard the Arc de Tiromphe view was better because you could see everything while closer to the ground (I would agree from my experience). However, we did find ourselves drawn to the park located south of the tower (2 minutes from the hotel) and it was fun to watch the people - especially at night. The English speaking staff at the hotel was very helpful with recommendations and making reservations for us. It was clear they would do anything to make our stay more enjoyable. About the space - we had a regular sized room and I walked it and I got 9 x 12. There was a small half closet that was in the wall, so my wife couldn't hang a dress, but it accomodated several shirts and pants. There was no other storage, not even dressers, just a small desk and end tables. That said, we used every inch of the place to make ourselves comfortable, were used to it in a day, and the size definitely didn't detract from our stay. I would just say get a bigger room if you can afford it. We simply didn't because we couldn't tell from the website that the rooms with the Eiffel view were larger.

We celebrated our 10th anniversary during this stay and in 2001 honeymooned at Hotel de Londres--enjoying the view of, and close proximity to, the Eiffel Tower. Each stay encourages us to return since the excellent location makes it convenient for us to visit the major historic and cultural sites of Paris and the staff is very helpful and gracious. We enjoyed walking to many interesting nearby places and found it convenient to access the Metro or the bus (be sure to purchase multiple one-ride tickets at any Metro Station). Depending on the direction, the 69 Bus runs along the nearby streets of Saint Dominique and Rue de Grenelle. Nearby Hotel de Londres are a floral shop, butcher shop, chocolate shop, a bakery, a small super market, a laundry mat, the postal office, a wine shop, several nice clothing shops and a variety of nice bistros, cafes and restaurants. Around the corner from the hotel is the La Fontaine de Mars bistro where President and Mrs. Obama had lunch with one of their daughters and two friends two years ago and another block away is the wonderful rue Cler which, with its many interesting shops, is a great place to stroll, unhindered by traffic (since it's closed to cars and allows abundant room for strolling along the cobblestone promenade). On this trip we learned that the hotel is almost complete in remodeling all 30 rooms. Remodeling the reception area was scheduled to be completed soon after our stay, so we know it will be especially nice at the time of our next visit. Much detailed and well-designed work was reflected in the remodeled rooms and bathrooms. I liked the towel warmer and the efficient use of shower space in the bathroom. Each room has its unique interior design for variety. It was easy to sleep, because the rooms were quiet and dark at night. The bathroom hardware, tile work, etc. is the best we have ever experienced in our extensive travels. The breakfast each morning was quite nice and the setting was very comfortable and very nicely decorated and cozy. On this trip we revisted the Louvre, climbed the stairs of the Arch of Triumph and sat on the steps of Sacre Coeur and gazed across Paris enjoying seeing it beautifully lighted at night. A real treat was seeing the sparkling lighting of the Eiffel Tower as we returned to the hotel. Our main goal on this trip was to explore the neighborhood of Hotel de Londres (primarily the area between the Eiffel Tower and the Sorbonne). We received great recommendations from Cedric and Arnaud at the front desk. My favorite colorful street to walk is rue Cler and began the walk at its intersection with rue de Grenelle. I discovered an Outlet Store at 71 Avenue Bosquet, 75007 where I purchased several cashmere sweaters. Arnaud, Cedric and Patrice were helpful in recommendating sites and restaurants. We highly recommend the following restaurants which are within walking distance of Hotel de Londres: Gusto Italia 199 rue de Grenelle, 75007 Paris Tel. 01.45 55 00 43 Le Petit Cler Maison Boudon 29 Rue Cler, 75007 Paris Tel. 01.45 50 17 50 Bellota-Bellota (Spanish) 18 rue Jean-Nicot Tel. 01.45 55 64 04 Sancerre (for breakfast) 22 Avenue Rapp, 75007, Paris Tel. 01.45 51 75 91 As a souvenir I got my hair shampooed and styled by Gilbert who works at Un Look Pour Toous.

We never normally stay anywhere with less than 4 stars but that was in the days when my daughter shared a room with us! Now we need two rooms and as Paris is so expensive we had to lower our usual standards. I was a bit appehensive about staying here I must admit despite the good reviews. We arrived in the evening to a very welcoming male receptionist but I did think reception looked a little tatty and small. We were given our rooms and used a small lift to reach them on the second floor. The rooms themselves were very nice and I believe newly decorated but they were small and cramped. We had one room over looking the back and the other overlooked the front. I was disappointed as I was led to believe the rooms were interconnected but they were two seperate rooms and therefore I ended up having to sleep in with my daughter as I did not feel comfortable allowing her to sleep alone. We slept in the room overlooking the front and I had the window open in the night as I dont like it stuffy. However I had to get up during the night and close it as it was very noisy. The bathrooms were very clean (as were the bedrooms) and I have no complaints at all. We never used the breakfast room and I didnt even know where it was as noone told us. There was a vending machine near the stairs to get coffee so I assumed they didnt have kitchen facitlities!! Work was being carried out during our stay and every morning we were awoken by banging. The builder had dragged a cable all the way up the stairs outside our room which was so dangerous. The location is excellent and you cannot fault it. The area is wonderful, plenty of restaurants, a supermarket and lots of lovely patisseries with fantastic french pastries and most of them do coffee/tea and have seating areas in them so getting breakfast was never a problem. The Eiffel tower is just around the corner and you can also get the tour buses here which will take you around all the main areas in Paris. I would stay here again simply for its cleanliness and its location. It does what it says on the tin! Provides you with comfy accommodation at a reasonable cost and in a good location. I would just know exactly what to expect next time. Oh, one other thing. We were not travelling until 4pm on departure so we asked to leave our cases somewhere. They obliged but when we returned, we realised they had left them in reception all day together with other peoples cases. I had bought a Tiffany necklace on my holiday and was horrified to think that this was left sitting in my bag in reception all day! I also had a panic when they aked me in the airport if anyone could have tampered with the cases and I realised that yes, matbe they could have.

There are several restaurants down the street, a laundromat and a grocery store are across from the hotel. Around the corner from the hotel are a couple of stores, including a chocolate and wine shop. Rue Cler, with its open air market stalls, is about 5 or 6 blocks east. The hotel itself is small, cozy, and wonderful, almost like a second home. On the first floor of hotel is a lobby and dining area for breakfast, which was included during our stay. Breakfast consisted of yogurts, cereal, some cold cuts of meat, several cheeses, and dried and fresh fruit. There is a computer located in a little nook by the lobby, but they use a different keyboard than the US does, but I had no trouble using it, you just have to double check the keys when using it. There's also a small elevator. When I say small I mean really really small. My friend and I were traveling with a large rolling suitcase and a backpack each, and we were barely able to fit inside the elevator. The rooms are tiny, and consisted of two single beds pushed together, with a table on either side of the bed. On the wall across the foot of a bed was a small work desk and chair with a TV. Next to the desk was bureau/closet that was dug into the wall. We had to put our rolling luggage and backpacks into the closet otherwise there would be no room to walk around. Attached to the room is a small bathroom containing a standing shower, sink, and toilet. The bathroom was separated from the room with a sliding door. If found the room to be pleasant, and the beds comfortable, but I don't recall finding a control for a heater or air conditioner inside the room. I think every room has a window that can be opened (everyone I spoke to had at least one window in their room). It was great to be able to open the window in the morning and breathe in the cold crisp air. You could smell the city waking up, not a bad way to begin the morning. When we first arrived I thought the staff seemed distant and aloof, but after awhile they seemed to warm up and were very friendly and attentive. One night a few of us were in the lobby talking about what we wanted to do that evening. A friend commented on how she wanted a cup of coffee at the time. The man working the desk disappeared for a bit then came back to our group and announced that he had made some coffee for us. He even walked us into the kitchen and made us our coffees. The staff were always able to recommend nearby spots to us. And they were all kind enough to help me bone up on my French.

Sold our room and lied to us!\u201d", "Author": "ajblackers", "ReviewID": "UR84559341", "Content": "We booked to stay here after seeing all the good reviews on Trip Advisor. We specifically chose this hotel because it was walking distance from my parents hotel - we knew we'd be getting in late on a Friday night and wanted to be able to quickly change, then walk to meet my parents for a planned supper without any taxi fuss. I called to confirm the booking at around 5pm, advising we would be in late around 10pm and making sure they would hold the room. At this stage nothing was mentioned. We arrived at the hotel just after 10pm to be told they were full and we were being moved to their sister hotel, which was not near to my parents. I asked why this was happening and the receptionist shugged. We asked whether it was possible they had made a mistake, and mentioned my phone call - which he remembered - but they did not care. The receptionist lied to us and said he'd give us a room if there was one but there just were none free. Shortly after that another couple arrived and asked whether their friends had checked in yet - to which the receptionist said no. He had blatantly lied to us about the availability of rooms - when we challenged him on this - he told us we booked on the internet (paying up front) at a discount price and the other couple were paying more. Overall, we were terribly disappointed with the attitude of the staff and being moved so late even after having confirmed the arrival time. Hotels like this trade on their good reputation, offer deals on the internet and then shove you off when they might be able to make a few more Eruos. I would not recommend this hotel and strongly advise you to re think before booking here....", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria BC", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "WandMMcIlroy", "ReviewID": "UR83877835", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the above hotel for 5 nights at the beginning of our vacation in September 2010.

The hotel was very clean and cosy with a well appointed room ,including a very comfortable bed. Cedric at the front desk was very kind and eager to give information about the surrounding area and Paris in general,a very nice young man who worked very hard to accomodate everyone.The buffet breakfast was very good,served by 2 cheerful ladies who also did housekeeping duties. In general a very nice and comfortable hotel. Free internet was available. My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was,for us most important. There was no safe either in the room or front desk to store valuables. Surely this matter could be easily rectified. All in all, we highly recommend this very pleasant hotel.

Choosing a hotel from afar left us concerned about what the accomodations would really be like since we had never traveled to a foreign country. Our concern was lessened upon entering the hotel and meeting Cedric, the day's concierege. He answered whatever questions we had, and took care of calling for cabs or giving instructions on where to catch a bus or train to various tourist locations if we needed them. He even taught us about how to make the keyboard work in English for their in-house computer tucked away in a space that I assume used to be for a pay telephone. That was helpful for keeping up with family news from the States. Since we didn't know if we'd ever make it back to Paris, we decided to splurge and get a room at the top of the building that would have a view of the Eiffel Tower as advertised on their website. As you lay on the bed in our quaint room, you could see the top two-thirds of the tower perfectly framed by our opened tall windows. Amazing! Though the elevator and room seemed small compared to American hotels, my guess is that may be normal with established hotels that close to the Eiffel Tower. Because part of our upper room was a dormer, it may be smaller than a regular room. I didn't ask, though, because even with ducking a little to take a shower, the view makes one forget everything else. Though it had only a small space to eat, the hotel was within easy walking distance of cafe's, and patisseries as well as to buses to various sites around town.

All four of them (Cedric, Matteus, Arneau and Patrice) are an absolute delight to deal with and added to the fun of our trip. Ms. Pringent is very fortunate to have such wonderful employees.

On the one hand it was a nice, comfortable room, but on the other hand we had some issues with it. The location in relation to the Eiffel is great. It's a very short walk and some rooms have a view of the top of the tower (we saw one, it's nothing to pay extra for, trust me). It was easy to find and there are a lot of great restaurants and patisseries in the area (highly recommend the Cafe Champ Du Mars and the Cafe Du Monde nearby). The staff was extremely nice and friendly. The bed was comfortable, and the room was nicely decorated. The large dual closets were nice, we were able to tuck all of our stuff away so we could keep the floor open (very necessary, as the room was tiny). Now for the downsides. Aside from the Eiffel, the location was terrible. It was a very long walk to the metro stop - and believe me, you WILL use the metro. We got so sick of making the long walk every day, especially at the end of the day when we were cold and tired and our feet hurt. Next time I go to Paris, the #1 thing I will look for in a hotel is proximity to a metro stop. The room is TINY - hardly any room to move around at all, and very little room to set down a suitcase. This didn't bother us that much, but if you're used to big open hotel rooms like you see in the USA, be prepared. The bathroom was unimpressive.. It was clean, but very small and the lights would intermittently stop working. We called down to have them fix the lights but as far as we could tell nothing was changed. The bulbs would randomly stop working while we were going to the restroom or showering which was NOT fun. Also, the bathroom tile is very VERY slippery when wet, so be careful. No included breakfast, which added to the overall trip cost. One tiiiiny elevator, so not great for large groups. The neighborhood was REALLY loud. Every night and every morning there would be loud trucks that came by (at one point they decided to chop down some trees at 2 AM in the morning which was awful). This is not the hotel's fault but it certainly kept us from getting a good night's sleep. Overall, although we generally liked the hotel, we wouldn't stay there again due to the location being so far from a metro stop.

As it was our first time in Paris, we wanted a convenient and reliable location to set out to explore the city. The Hotel de Londres Eiffel proved (almost) perfect for us. We arrived from London via the Eurostar to the Gare du Nord. Taxis were plentiful, even if you have to line up for a few minutes at the side of the station for one. The train station is well policed to discourage \"gypsy\" cabs. The cab ride to the hotel is about 20 minutes. If you do not know any French, I would suggest writing down the address or name of the hotel to show the driver. All the taxi drivers we had had a very limited knowledge of English. It wasn't a problem for us as I speak French, but it could be a problem if you do not. All the cabs are well maintained and very clean, though. The hotel itself is on a small side street about 5 blocks away from the Eiffel Tower. We were glad we splurged on a top floor room with a view of the tower. It was definitely worth it. The rooms are very small, but very clean and well-maintained. Full maid service every morning. Be prepared for the smallest elevator known to man. The front door is always staffed. A small breakfast is optional, but we instead took advantage of the many small patisseries and cafes on Rue Saint-Dominique just up the street from the hotel. There is also a small supermarket on Saint-Dominique half a block over that has quick snacks to take back to your room at reasonable prices. Ask the front desk staff for restaurant suggestions. They were spot on. A wonderful Italian storefront restaurant is at the bottom end of Rue Augereau. The same restaurant occupies two corners of the same intersection at Augereau and Rue de Grenelle. Pick the least busiest. The cafes along the Parc du Champs de Mars near the Eiffel Tower can be very expensive. By getting away from the tourist points, you can find some very reasonably priced restaurants. Cafes and restaurants are everywhere in this city. You will not go for want of good food. The Eiffel Tower is always busy. If you are athletic, there is an alternate entrance at the base that leads to stairs up. You can buy a two or three day pass for the Metro, which we used to get everywhere. Very convenient and safe. The station at Pont de l'Alma was the most convenient to the hotel and had a tourist officer selling tickets and giving info from the street level office. A short list of touristy things that we hit: Pere Lachaise Cemetery: Half hour by Metro. Free entrance. Maps and a washroom are available at the cemetery office 500' into the grounds. Many of the tombs are in quite a state of disrepair. Lots of walking on cobblestones uphill. We weren't too impressed overall. I guess everyone needs to see Jim Morrison's tomb (unremarkable). Musee d'Orsay: 10 minutes by Metro from hotel. Very impressive and well thought out. Some very famous works of art available for viewing. Musee de Louvre: Possibly the worst laid out building ever made into a museum. Originally the palace for French royalty, the museum is contained within several extremely long wings. Massive numbers of people. We got lost at least twice. The maps are terrible. I do not recommend it for people with small children or if you are not in good shape. The room where the Mona Lisa is kept was a sea of humanity all struggling to get near enough to take a picture. If you don't have time to see everything you want to in Paris, make this the place that you scratch off your list. Your sanity will thank you. One final warning about the hotel. Taxis do not usually wait for fares in front of it. On the morning of our departure we had the front desk call a cab. It took more than an hour to arrive (on a weekday), resulting in us missing our train back to London. Hailing a cab is extremely difficult on the streets around the hotel (at least it was the morning we needed one). Have the front desk book one for you the night before. This was the only negative point about the hotel. With a little planning it shouldn't be an issue. All in all a beautiful city.

There is no need for a transformer/converter unless you bring something (like an old 110V hair dryer) that doesn't a have the variable voltage built in. I used the small adapter to recharge my camera and phone battery and had no problems. Everyone on staff was very helpful and willing to do anything to assist you.

It has nice, clean, cosy and functional rooms - by Paris standards. Finally, the staff are very friendly and helpful.

All hotel staff were excellent, very responsive and willing to assist in any way. Special mention to Arnaud at the desk who was always willing to go the extra mile to help us in every small way (most especially when my wife and son got sick and we needed recommendations for pharmacies and good safe remedies as well as translations) and also to Genevieve and the housekeepers who kept our room spotless. The location (Rue Cler 7th district) was simply wonderful, safe and welcoming-- a true neighborhood in every sense of the word where you can see Parisians living life as they do each day from walking their dogs to carrying grocery bags on the way home after work. Around the short corner we had everything you could need: a very complete and reasonably priced supermarket, two pharmacies, a pastry shop, a meat shop/deli that opens only in the afternoons but which serves the best rotisserie chicken we'd tasted in awhile, a superb family-owned Chinese restaurant, a cafe, boutiques, souvenir shops, bookstores, convenience stores and so much more! But the icing on the cake for our first visit ever to Europe was seeing the Eiffel tower right around the corner! Every night we'd sneak out for a short stroll from the hotel just to see it sparkle at the top of each hour for 10 mins.

I didn't find it too small- we had closet and shelf space, two cubby hole shelves beside the bed and a writing desk. We had working windows in the bedroom and bath and a good a/c system which was digitally controlled and quiet. Even though we faced the street, it was a very quiet street so we were never bothered by noise. We enjoyed the small refrigerator for storing our drinks and cheese. The flat screen TV worked well. The free internet in the lobby was a nice perk. We wrote to the hotel twice before our trip with questions about the metro connections and they answered promptly. We didn't really have opportunities to talk to the staff, but they were warm and friendly and helped us with a few needs. We didn't eat breakfast in the lobby, but found many other places at every turn.

I am very happy that we chose a less touristy area to stay, as we didn't spend time in the room but needed to sleep well at night. We also enjoyed people watching from the Rue Cler cafes- lots of fun. We thought this hotel was a very good bargain for Paris. It was exceptionally clean, quiet and had lots of charm. I have always preferred small, family run places in Europe for the personal touch and authenticity.

But really how much time do you spend in your room?! The metro isn't exactly close to the hotel. It's several blocks away. Not a bad thing, just be prepared. After a long day of walking around Paris, you'll have one more short jaunt to the hotel from the metro. The Metro system is amazing though. While there are several magnificent restaurants around the hotel, we decided to hop the metro and go across town for dinner a couple of nights. There is a Starbucks several blocks away, not just around the corner, but if you head toward Rue de Clar you almost can't miss it. I highly recommend Rick Steve's Rue de Clar walk, its incredibly short, but this little street is great! Every little store you can imagine, a great look into Parisian life!

Shower was a little small but with glass doors. Maid staff didn't replace all the towels each day - used two, got one, but for Europe had several different sizes of towels. Internet free in lobby was a definite plus - very easy to use. Breakfast buffet was adequate and since it was free with the room deal it was ok. Cereal, cheese, deli type meat, juice, coffee, tea, etc. Only downside was security with room keys(cards). The staff wanted you to turn the card key to the staff at the lobby desk when leaving. There was no security check when you came back to the hotel and asked for room # key. Technically anyone could ask for any room # and receive a key card for that room. Other problem is inside the room the lock on the door didn't seem to lock from the inside - maybe it did, but another person told me she turned the knob to lock it from the inside and then didn't hear the maid come in while in the shower - so obviously hers didn't lock from the inside.

But what isn't clear is that the \"Poets\" rooms aren't serviced by that elevator. Our room 107 was up three flights of narrow stairs. So tell the booking clerk of any special needs. Actually, I like those narrow curving stairs, they always make me think of Paris. The hotel breakfast was 12 euros ($18!) for cold cuts, cheese, cold cereal and bread. Walk out the lobby door and turn right, make another right on to Saint Dominique. Walk about 100 feet and across the street is the prettiest, friendliest little patissier shop you could hope to have breakfast at. If you keep walking about three blocks further there is a Starbucks. Although why any American would go to Paris to drink at Starbucks is beyond me. The best thing about the de Londres is the location near the Rue Clare.

FWIW, I used trip advisor for all of the research for our european vacation and by and large the reviews from other contributers were fairly accurate. Bottom Line upfront- the hotel was nice, clean and affordable. For someone who had never traveled outside the states unless I was on a cruise ship, the size of the rooms was something you need to get used too. The rooms and baths are immaculately clean but they are small. It doesnt really matter because you will find yourself spending hardly anytime there anyways. a slight annoyance was the fact that despite numerous email confirmations they failed to have our eiffel tower view room available when we got there and put us on a lower floor. To compensate they offered us two free tickets for a cruise on the seine. (which was offfered without any complaining on our behalf-they genuinely felt bad for the mix up and we were so tired from the flight we just wanted to get in a room) The room on the lower floor was like a closet and I would STRONGLY suggest the tower view rooms which seem a bit larger and are nicer and are well worth the additional cost. We opted out of the breakfest and found numerous places to eat around the Hotel. La Gourmandaiss which is on Rue de Grenelle seemed friendly to tourists and has great take-out breakest food at a fraction of the cost---plus its on the way to the metro. To our surprise, despite checking in to the smaller room, our eiffel tower room became open and the hotel moved all of our belongs up while we were out to lunch. Which was nice. The hotel also has WI-Fi so if you bring your laptop you should have no problem logging in. They have a computer in the lobby but it is a french keyboard and unless you read and write french will probably be a bit cumbersome for most. It is a few blocks from the Eifel Tower which makes for a romantic evening stroll and is a a short walk from the Metro Stop Ecole Militaire. There is also a Laundry right next to the hotel which is great if you plan on traveling light. All in all would a reccomend this hotel to a friend?

That was all very easy. The hotel room was very small, as expected, but also very clean and comfortable. The hairdryer in the bathroom worked fine and it has a electricity converter thingy, so we didn't need to bring our own. I loved the bread and pastries every morning at breakfast and the coffee too. No, the woman who serves breakfast doesn't seem to speak much English, but this is France. And even though I don't speak any French I was able to figure out my coffee request (hint: noir means black). The elevator is small, but it looks newish, has a large mirror and works great, so even though I am claustrophobic, I never felt uneasy in the elevator. Arnaud was wonderful and very helpful. He made dinner reservations and recommendations for us several time and helped us navigate our way to Versailles and Chartres via train. Our favorite restaurants were Cafe le Bosquet (great mozzarella tart, frites and creme brule), Thoumieux (best onion soup I've ever had) and Le P'tit Troquet (fabulous endive-apple-cheese salad and pork wine stew). Every dinner we had was within easy walking distance to the hotel. One piece of advice. Arnaud can all you a cab, but they start the meter running as soon as they get the call, usually adding 4-6 euros on to the bill. Once it took over 20 minutes for the cab to come, causing us to miss our train and costing us 14 euros when we stepped in the cab.

When we checked in Arnaud went out of his way to welcome us and to make sure I got the room I requested. I even swithced keys with my friend and Arnaud switched the keys back reassuring me that the original key given to me was for the room I indeed requested which was one with an Eiffel tower view.

I'm not sure why this surprised me but it really did!! Arnaud was very conscientious and polite during our entire stay. Felt very safe in the area and came back to the hotel during the wee hours most nights. The lobby door is locked after hours so they will \"buzz\" you in. There is free internet in a small closet type room off the lobby. We had a delicious lunch at the Jules Verne Restraunt (top of the Eiffle Tower) at the tune of $750.00 (USD) for four of us...ouch!! The view was fabulous and it was several courses which took about 3 hours but the wait staff was stuffy, curt and even abit rude. My water glass was left empty after filling everyone elses at the table. Not sure what I did, but I definitly felt \"blacklisted\" whch was crazy considering we were spendind $750.00 for lunch!!!

We booked 1 room with Eiffel tower views (for my parents who have never visited Paris) and another room for my husband and I. Our room overlooked the street and flats across the way. Flower boxes hanging from every window. An amazing cheese and meat shop below. Our room was decorated in colours of creams and green. Very soothing. Our bathroom contained a shower cubicle just big enough to turn around in - but it's paris! I could hardly complain about a shower! Lovely olive soap and thyme body wash left as complimentary. Mini fridge stocked with fizzy drinks and beer.(No wine, however a terrific wine shop around the corner - closes somewhat early-before 10:00 pm, I believe). My parents room, with eiffel tower views was just as spectacular. The red and white toile wallpaper makes the room feel smaller than it is, but the view at night makes up for it. The bathroom held a nice size shower and bath. Mini fridge stocked with cold drinks also in this room. Extra blankets and pillows also available in the wardrobe space of both rooms. Just around the corner, a mere two minute walk stands the eiffel tower in all of its glory. There is a terrific \"American\" style bistro around the corner on your way to the eiffel tower. If the weather is nice, have breakfast outside (omletts to die for!). Cedric, the smile behind the hotel's front desk is spectacular. He will give you advice on places to eat, how to travel there, etc. He suggested we visit the Palace of Versaille which is a short train journey out. If you have time, do this! At the moment, there is a bit of development happening and down the street from the hotel, a building is being remodelled. However, the noise is only heard during the day when you would more than likely be siteseeing.

The main important points for me were the friendly staff and lovely room. The front room I had on the second floor wasn't noisy (just a few US tourists every second day or so on the street or outside your room door by the lift but they didn't hang around long). Bring your own flannel/face cloth, body lotion, shower cap, teaspoon (no coffee or tea making facilities in the room and no food allowed and you might need it for eating food outside). Some rooms have a bath (not full-length) and the water was occasionally tepid at peak showering times over the crowded Easter period. I found the street view from my second floor front-facing room 'cute' and much more interesting than the quieter back-facing views. The free hotel internet access is standing up in a little kiosk, so useful for checking your email but not for anything more serious. Also explains why the kiosk is usually available when you need it. I appreciated French, US and English (Wall Street Journal, Herald Tribune, Guardian) newspapers available to guests in reception everyday. The hotel is a good five-eight minutes walk from the nearest metro, Ecole Militaire, but it was worth crossing the park to go to Dupleix or La Motte Picquet metro stops. Definitely take the 69 bus, at least as far as Bastille (its outward journey is along the Seine and the homebound one through the Louvre). You could also decide to take the 87 from the hotel to Bastille but the trip isn't quite as scenic. The stop for both is just off Place G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Gouraud on Av J. Bouvard (at the start of the park as if you were walking to the Eiffel Tower). The breakfast was fine but I preferred going to Rue Cler , even though it was more expensive, for a more Parisian atmosphere. Some tourists are disappointed that Rue Cler's not more exciting but I enjoyed seeing the same locals there every day and got chatting to some as well. At caf\u00e9s and restaurants the French think it is an insult to offer you a carafe of water if you don't ask for it (presumably the gourmets stick to their wines) so don't feel annoyed at asking for some (de l'eau ordinaire because I am told de l'eau normale is still mineral water). Caf\u00e9 Constant just a couple of doors away from the hotel does the best food but its atmosphere is very 'caf\u00e9 like' and unexciting. Le Croque Au Sel just around the corner in the little Italian-like Square Sedillot has a much better atmosphere and its food is OK. Try and sit upstairs if you can. Their competitor next door looks even better (i.e. it was always more crowded), but I didn't get a chance to try it out. The square is literally just behind the hotel. Visitors who recommend buying a museum pass beforehand to avoid the long queues outside Gare d'Orsay are absolutely right! I didn't and ended up coming back latish on Thurs night (when it's open late) to avoid queuing for such a long time.

I know by U.S. standards they are small, but it's different in their culture. We adjusted well enough to the small room and bathroom. It wasn't a big deal. We read about Paris before we left in Rick Steve's travel guides, and expected the rooms to be small. In addition, I think the noise level around the hotel was fine. We did hear the garbage/refuse trucks sometimes, but that really didn't bother us. It was great to look outside the window and see what was going on below. It wasn't a very busy street; I thought it was a quaint hotel, with a small view of the Eiffel Tower. It did look quite nice at night when the tower was lit up. Additionally, the continental breakfast was really good. They usually served croissants, ham (wonderful), and cheese (la tomme). They also had cereal and yogurt there. A nice lady asked us if we wanted coffee and attended to us. It was pretty much self-serve. She was always very polite. The coffee was wonderful; the best I've ever had. By the way, the staff at the hotel were quite pleasant and helpful, even with the broken French I knew, the concierge was helpful. Thankfully, he was able to converse with me in English. Even before we arrived at the hotel, I was impressed with their service. I was able to email the hotel with my reservation and requests; they were quite responsive. They usually contacted me within a few hours of my email. I had emailed them about two-three months before our trip and with each email they responded to my questions. Equally important, we were able to get around Paris quite well from the hotel. We were able to take the metro (about 10 minute walk). It's not far from Rue Cler, and there's a wonderful restaurant a few doors down, which we visited at least twice. It's called La Varangue. We also discovered a few other restaurants on our own just by looking at the menus, and trying it out. By the way, if you are interested in internet access, the hotel does have a computer in the lobby for guests to use that has internet access. I was able to correspond with my kids using their computer. I didn't use the wireless internet access since I didn't bring any laptop or PDA on this trip.

We were on the top floor (6th) with a fantastic view of the Eiffel Tower it is at night that you can really appreciate it when the lights twinkle on the hour. While the room as smallish is just added to the atmosphere with the very french wallpaper. The bed was comfortable & the bar fridge an added bonus. The shower was a little tricky due to the windows opening to the apartments over the road so one has to be a tad discrete until the windows mist up especially for tall people & while the lift is very small at least there is one unlike a lot of European hotels who do not have lifts but many flights of stairs to walk up. The tower is a mere 5-10min walk depending on how fast or slow one walks from there it is a short walk across the road to the river where we caught the Batobus river boat which is a hop on hop off version to the bus. From the river is another short walk over the bridge to the Trocadero area stand at the top & look back at one of the most amazing sights of the Eiffel especially at night - restaurants abound in this area The tube stn is a bit of a walk from the hotel especially with luggage glad we took a taxi instead from Garde De Noeud Stn which was very inexpensive - there is a well stocked grocery store, delicious pastry shops, restaurants & pubs in easy walking distance to the hotel even though it was winter we sat outside one of the pubs to have a drink as the smoke inside was unbearable but we believe the laws on smoking in France are about to change. Also do not try & shop in Paris on a Sunday as the shops in the \"opera\" area are closed this we found unbelievable something we are used to in Australia - some shops are open at the top of the concorde near the Arch de Truimphe.

I thought it would be important to express my opinion of this hotel. We stayed at Hotel de Londres from February 16th through 19th, 2007. First of all, I booked this hotel based on what I read from Tripadvisor. This was the first time I used Tripadvisor\u2019s advice. Sometimes one wonders if the reviews are from the hotel owners, employees, friends and family of the hotel. Regardless, this is my experience of the hotel. As a Valentine\u2019s weekend surprise for my wife, I booked a double bed for three nights at this hotel. The cost came out to be around $417.00 USD. We arrived at the hotel from an airport shuttle (CDG airport; 17 euro per person). Once at the hotel, we were greeted by a real friendly female lady at the counter. I think she was either the owner or a manager of the hotel. I had emailed the hotel and requested a room on the highest floor as possible. Based on reading the prior reviews, I did not think paying extra for the superior room with a view of the Eiffel was worth the money. The nice lady directed the clerk to give us room #62, which was the highest floor and a view of the top half of the Eiffel Tower. We really appreciate the upgrade without the extra cost. As expected, our room was tiny and the shower was small, but overall the room was spotless. Both my wife and I are small (5\u2019-6\u201d) and we could barely fit on the bed. Maybe its the European thing. The free internet wireless was awesome. We were able to webcam and talk to our kids in California everyday for free using Yahoo messenger. There was a slight issued. Since we were on the 6th floor, there was no Wifi connection from the hotel, so I had to tap into the neighbors\u2019 unsecured line. Keep in mind that the walls at this hotel are very thin. Whenever my wife uses the webcam and talk from our room, you could hear her in the hallway (she doesn\u2019t talk loud, but the walls are thin). On our 2nd day, a family from the US checked into the hotel with kids. 2 years and up. They were on the 1st or 3rd floor and we could hear them from our room (at 1am) so we went out for a walk and came back at 3am. By that time, the kids had fallen asleep\u2026. That\u2019s the biggest disadvantage of this hotel. I was unable to sleep 2 nights out of 3. Just my luck. I am a very light sleeper and in the middle of the night, I could hear the people next door using the bathroom. Yes, water from a person (pee) and into the toilet then flushing. If you are a slight sleeper, may want to consider. The location of the hotel is okay. It took us about 10 minutes to walk to the Eiffel Tower. On our last day at the hotel, again, we were unable to sleep and got out of bed at 5am and went for a walk to the Eiffel Tower at 6 am... Its nice to see the Tower without the other tourist. The other attraction at this location is Cler Rue, as mentioned by others. I thought this would be a big open market, but I was disappointed that the market was real small and it took us about 5-10 minutes to walk through the market. On our last day in Paris, we were near the Notre Dam and found a great location. I think the street is St. German or something like that. If you get a chance, take the underground train and visit this place. Lots of shops, restaurants and people (tourists, locals, etc.). I wished we knew this place sooner. Overall, I think this hotel is okay. If we visit Paris again, I won't stay at this hotel again due to the location and noise, but hey... you get what you paid for....Best of luck.", "Date": "February 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cComfortable room in great location\u201d", "Author": "finickytripper", "ReviewID": "UR6694765", "Content": "We found this hotel to be charming, well-decorated and very comfortable, and in a very good location.

The elevator was a little cramped and involved two doors to enter and exit, but was a welcome hassle vs. climbing two stairs with luggage. We found the front desk staff helpful but a little stuffy. The recommended Indian restaurant down the alley was fantastic.

We arrived a day early and indulged in a upper premium floor with a \"room with a view\" of the Eiffel tower as a treat to ourselves. The room was the smallest I've ever been in, and had us a bit scared, thinking this was the premium room and that we would be demoted to an even smaller, regular room for the rest of our one week stay with our tour. The room was nicely decorated, with matchy fabric on the curtains and bedspread and deep colored walls which made the room feel even smaller than it probably was. It was all very attractive once you get used to the smallness of the room. The bed was comfortable and there were good pillows and blankets. Built in wall cupboards served as our closets which were a bit tight but manageable. The \"view\" of the Eiffel tower was comical, since only the top 1/10th of the tower could be seen due to neighboring buildings blocking the view. Not worth the splurge for the more expensive room with the tower view, since the whole tower was a short walk away and we could visit it any time we wanted on foot. Our \"regular\" room on a lower floor, for the rest of our stay was 25% larger, which was a big improvement and cost less. The bathrooms were spotless, with new fixtures, and a charming paned window that opened out to a windowbox and a view of the street below. Standard plain hotel towels, but plenty of them and they were changed daily. The tub (without any curtain or doors) had a hand held shower wand which required some creative bathing, but there was plenty of hot water and water pressure. A nice big sink mirror with shelf worked great for shaving and make-up. The street was a little noisy at night, with a garbage truck doing the rounds at least 3 times the week we were there and the occasional vespa whizzing by. It wasn't too bad, we got used to it, and we enjoyed having the windows open for the fresh air it offered. The breakfast buffet was pretty good, fresh croissants & baguettes, jams, some fruit, yogurts, coffee and teas. It's boring for 7 days in a row, but it's great to get you out the door. I wouldn't pay extra for it unless you're in a hurry to get touring. There's so many delicious bakeries and cafe's nearby to choose from. We had eggs out twice just to mix it up. The reception area is smallish, but sufficient, with a little closet equipped with a computer for internet access. I used it daily with little problem and rarely had to wait to get on it. The staff all speak perfect English and were helpful when solicited for advice. The neighborhood is great. Behind us was a service alley, but a few steps toward the corner was a nice shopping street with a variety of stores, restaurants and very pedestrian oriented with single lanes of traffic. The Rue Cler neighborhood was only a few blocks away and had all the wonderful open market style shops with groceries, cafes, specialty shoppes of all kinds. The Eiffel tower was about 2 1/2 blocks away and put on a light show every hour at night. Great location, couldn't be beat.

In view of some of the negative recent feedback from reviewers, I wanted to add my opinions. First, the location is ideal. It was very convenient, with a lot of sights within walking distance (including of course the Eiffel Tower). A few blocks away is the Rue Cler area, a popular pedestrian-only street with lots of shops and restaurants; and there are many convenience stores and fine restaurants just around the corner from the hotel. Second, the hotel itself was impeccably clean. Our room was small, but not too small, and the bathroom was very nice and bigger than in most European hotels. The beds & pillows were very comfortable, and we heard no street noise whatsoever. Third, the staff was courteous, helpful and friendly. They assisted us with hotel recommendations, reservations, shuttle service reservations, etc. , -- and they speak English. We thought the breakfast was good: a selection of breads, crossants, cheese, ham, yogurt ,and cereal, along with fruit juices, tea, coffee and hot chocolate. This was perfect for all of us because we wanted something more substantial than croissants or pastries. The woman serving us every morning was very friendly and upbeat. An added bonus: I loved being able to use the hotel's internet connection in the lobby to send email to family back home. (The keyboard is French, but you can switch it to an English keyboard by clicking on the icon on the bottom right of the computer screen.)

The breakfast was very poor and had very little choices, I think this is the way it is in most french hotels so it's probably not a particular problem to this one. The ladies who served breakfast spoke nothing but french, so if your french is not too good you might be in a bit of trouble. The reception staff was not particularly helpful to us. I agree with another reviewer who wrote that they cater to USA tourist here so that might have been the problem since we're not Americans. The location is the best thing about this hotel.

All and all, a great off season getaway well served by a well located and welcoming hotel.", "Date": "February 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel near eiffel tower\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4414463", "Content": "lovely stay and staff, we will rocommend you, hotel is just near the eiffel tower, and the Ecole Militaire Metro station is five minutes, the room was perfectly romantic clean and modern, free wireless and internet access. fitzerald.c", "Date": "February 5, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel de Londres Eiffel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d265476-Reviews-Hotel_de_Londres_Eiffel-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$147 - $293*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1 Rue Augereau</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75007</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514805", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/1e/9f/e6/new-hotel-de-londres.jpg"}}
