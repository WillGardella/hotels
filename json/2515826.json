We felt truly spoiled at this hotel. Every employee we encountered was as friendly as could be. We used the concierge services several times, and they did a great job of explaining our options as far as transportation to and from the various parks. The Hilton and its sister hotel (connected via the convention center) the Waldorf Astoria, have dedicated buses that transport guests to the Disney Parks. We were able to purchase Mears bus service to Universal Studios at the concierge desk. It was all very convenient. As far as the pool area - wow! I have never been offered a cold towel at a hotel pool before, so that was a first. I'd also never seen a lazy river at a hotel, and it was tons of fun to take a turn floating around the pool every so often just to cool off. A true highlight was the Friday and Saturday night \"Dive-In Movies\". This would be weather permitting, obviously, but again, this was something we had never seen and it was so relaxing. They erect a big inflatable screen poolside, and you can watch while you swim or from the comfort of a lounge. We made it down on Friday night to watch Despicable Me. I love this idea. The whole pool area was a joy. We ate at the ground level restaurant called Harvest Bistro. You have the choice of dining indoors or out. We chose to eat outside and found a table in the shade. The food was really great, especially the Mussels in the Pot appetizer. We also utilized the poolside grille, Beech. Again, very good food. The fries with truffle oil and parmesan were a big hit. One last point - this hotel had the speediest elevators we'd ever encountered. There are separate banks of elevators for the lower floors and the upper floors. This was really nice, since we were on the 12th floor. We never had to wait for more than a half minute or so.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Altamonte Springs, Florida, United States", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Experience\u201d", "Author": "Paul M", "ReviewID": "UR129121843", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for a week and not only was the hotel immaculate the service was impeccable.

Check-in went smoothly. No problems with the two adjoining double queen beds. Rooms were very clean, no odor of any kind, bathrooms were spotless and overall very nice rooms. We were lucky to have rooms near the elevator (I felt sorry for the people on the other end of the hall due to the elevators being located completely on one end of the hall on each floor). One pet-peeve of mine was apparent when I unloaded my laptop to check-in with the office and make sure nothing of great importance was needed....Internet is not complimentary! In this day and age, WHO DOES NOT OFFER FREE WI-FI IN THEIR ROOMS?!?! I am a business guy and understand the perceived need for a revenue stream generated from something almost as important as food & water (according to my daughter.....laughter please). $10/day or $24.99 for a three day pass for Wi-Fi in your room. This is a little over-the-top and completely unreasonable. Wi-Fi is available free in the lobby and randomly available at the pool area. Who wants to lug a laptop down to the lobby, search for a power source and actually do any type of business? I don't. Hilton should change this policy immediately....it isn't like they aren't getting your hard-earned $$$ each time you turn around, get a bagel or coffee or want to float down the lazy river (more on this below....) The pool area. One word sums it up.... UNBELIEVEABLE. Simply one of the greatest resort pool areas I've EVER been to. This is no exaggeration. The lazy river and the water slide are a parents' best friend. However, again there is a caveat to this and GUESS WHAT it involves ???? Money. The resort charges for renting life jackets and \"floaties\" for your kids! $5/day for each. I only shook my head in disbelief. The pool area does prohibit outside food and drink and requires you to order from Beech, the quasi-teki bar by the pool. At beech, expect $11-15 drinks, $6-7 beers and $14-19 dollar sandwiches (including taxes). Our second day by the pool, including lunch and jacket and \"floatie\" rentals = $175! Full disclosure: we did have a few mixed drinks and three adult lunches and one child lunch. However, this was still VERY EXPENSIVE. The Harvest Cafe in our opinion was the best-value for food there. The all-you-can-eat adult breakfast buffet is $19 + tax. However, your children can eat free. Still a tad expensive, but, by far the best value. They have Lox, various other meats, hard boiled eggs, made-to-order omelets, pancakes, waffles, fruits, bread, bagels and the usual bacon, sausage and scrambled eggs. All served with coffee and OJ. The food was great and very fresh. The service was wonderful and attentive. All in all a Very Good resort. If Hilton would address some of the \"nickle & diming\" going on....it would be undoubtedly Execellent. I probably would stay again, just would modify some of my family's habits significantly.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat property\u201d", "Author": "Randyt4", "ReviewID": "UR128940564", "Content": "Very nice property with outstanding service.

We went with as three adults and three children and stayed in two adjoining queen size rooms. The rooms were big enough for our use and both had bathrooms with bath and shower facilities. Each bedroom also had tea and coffee making facilities free for use and replenished each day. The hotel leave you two bottles of water, but beware, they charge you $5 each for these. It\u2019s much cheaper to pop down to Wal-Mart and buy your own supply. The room also has a fridge, radio alarm clock and flat screen television. Although we didn\u2019t have much time to watch the television, what was on offer you either had to pay for or there were free view channels, but these were pretty dire, so we didn\u2019t watch much telly, but then we didn\u2019t go on holiday to watch telly. The rooms were cleaned on a daily basis and bed sheets changed every three or four days. The staff at the hotel were all very helpful and welcoming, especially the reception and concierge teams. If you travel with Virgin, you get free use of the Concierge room on the 16th floor, which has a free pool table, three computers, (although only 1 worked during our stay), a WII and a television that showed different channels to that in your room. There is free Wi-Fi in the concierge room and also in the hotel reception. If you want Wi-Fi in your room you have to pay for it. There is a games room with video games and a pool table on the ground floor of the hotel next to a Disney shop. The main restaurant is the Harvest Bistro, which we used every day for Breakfast as we got complimentary breakfast for everyone because we booked with Virgin. There is a wonderful breakfast buffet, with Cereal, freshly made omelettes, bacon, sausage, tomatoes, breakfast potatoes, or fruit salad, yoghurt etc, or waffles and pancakes or a selection of pastries, something for everyone. There is sometimes a wait to be seated for breakfast, but i don\u2019t think we ever waited more than 20 minutes, usually no more than 5 minutes. There is also a very nice Italian restaurant called \u201cLa Luce\u201d which was very nice but a bit pricier. However, yet again by booking with Virgin we saved 20% on all food and drinks bought in the hotel, that included the Harvest Bistro, La Luce and the Beech, which is the poolside cafe. The swimming pool is a fantastic lazy river running though two circular pools. The only problem is people reserve their sun beds with towels early in the morning, however pool staff will remove these towels if no-one uses them sun beds after 60 minutes. You are also allowed to use the facilities of the Waldorf Astoria hotel next door. Our children spent a lot of time in the pools; you can rent or buy things like rubber rings here also. In the evenings they show poolside movies on a large inflatable screen which you can watch either on the pool loungers or in the pool or hot tub etc. There a regular free buses to the Disney parks, however you will either have to drive yourself or use a taxi or one of the hotel town cars to get to Universal. (We used the town cars as it is a flat fee and you know what you are paying before you leave, if you use a taxi, then if you get stuck in traffic the bill goes up and you also have to tip the driver) Saying this, we used a town car to take us to universal and it cost $45 for 6 passengers, we got a taxi back and after paying the tip it was about $38. We mainly used town cars as even though they may work out slightly more as they are luxury cars and very comfortable. We had a wonderful stay in the Hilton Bonnet creek and if we ever return to Orlando we would stay there again.

Location is superb, right in Disney area, but because you are in Bonnet Creek Resort, it is like being in a small park area, within Disney. I understand that this plot of land was the only piece Disney didn't buy.So you feel as though you are away from the action, and can relax, when really you are minutes away. You can see Epcot, Hollywood Tower of Terror and Downtown Disney from up high on the 16th floor - fantastic views. You can also use the sister hotel next door, The 'Waldorf Astoria'. The room was bigger than a typical standard sized hotel room. We were on the 16th floor, and I think there are 1000 rooms, but with the level of attention given to us, you would think they only had 100 guests. The staff remembered your names after a few days, the lady who serviced our room left us extra tea bags, as she knew this was what we drank. We had breakfast every day in the Harvest Bistro, where there is a buffet of everything you could wish for, and chefs cook you omelettes to order. Food was top quality. Brilliant Easter egg hunt organised for Easter Sunday - all the kids loved it, and there were thousands of eggs! The pool and lazy river are great to float around.

I was actually bummed at first because we were so close to Disney and I have never been to the theme parks so I wanted to stay there. Being stuck in meetings all day, I didnt expect to have much time to play but I thought that I could use what little free time I had to explore Disney World and see the famous castle. Based on the title of this review, you can guess that I never made it to the parks. Some of my coworkers wanted to skip the planned lunch buffet and check out one of the hotel restaurants. We went to Beech, the pool bar and grille and had an amazing time. It's located right nexted to the lazy river and had a view of the golf course. We sipped on mojitos and ate Cuban sandwiches. It was perfect. The server, Larry, was a complete doll. Our drinks were never empty (not a bad thing when you have to go back to meetings, though walking back with a cocktail in my hand did earn me some weird looks from other conference attendees...i think they were just jealous). After the meetings concluded, I opted not to take the resort's complementary shuttle to Disney World and instead floated on an inner tube in the hotel's lazy river. Yeah, it cost $5 for the tube rental but that means that there are tubes for those who want them. Tip to the budget traveler---bring your own innertube, they'll inflate it for you right at their pool store free of charge and then you have a tube for your entire stay. I actually saw a number of tubes in the hotel room windows, from people who had brought their own. I've seen reviews of this property on here that said that pool servers were lacking. I dont think this was the case when I visited. There were numerous employees walking around taking orders. I think were people get frustrated, is that they ask for a menu from a server and the server gives them a few minutes to look it over. Guests get angry because the server has moved on to assist another guest and checks back in about five minutes. Maybe flags on the chairs would help let the sevice staff know that a person is ready to order or put the menu on ipads so that people can place their order whenever they feel like it. I just waited the five minutes and soaked up a little florida sunshine. You're at a pool for goodness sakes, slow down, relax, and enjoy. My service experience at the pool was great. Got a menu from the server, Arnold, who was walking around. Five minutes later, he came back to get my order. Instead of a mojito, I had a had a hibiscus margarita, something that Arnold had sold me on with patron and fresh margarita mix. It was absolutely what I needed after the conference. He took my food order too (a turkey wrap and sun chips) and who I assumed was the manager because of his golf style attire, Daniel, delivered it. It was great to see a leader working alongside his employees. He checked to see how my experience was and thanked me for staying at the hotel. I spent the rest of the day at the pool, ordered another margarita and relaxed. Who needs theme parks, kids, and lines for rollercoasters when you have a pool and a staff like this one.

I was nearly in tears I was so disapppointed with the hotel we were in. Then I spoke to Jennifer & all was resolved. We could have the last night of our holiday here & we could check in early & check out late. I was nearly in tears again because Jennifer had rescued the last 36 hours of our holiday. I asked if we could have a high floor away from elevators & by 11am the next morning we were in our wonderful, peaceful room with king sized bed on a high floor as far away from elevators as possible, with reception having 'phoned us to check that it was comfortable before sending up the bellhop with our cases. Bliss. We went for a stroll around the grounds which are beautifully maintained which was relaxing & enjoyed seeing all the wild birds by the lake. Then we had a quiet read by the pool, a few guests floated peacefully by. I returned to our room some hours later & found a welcome note from Jennifer hoping that all was now well, & complimentary vouchers for coffees & pastries. We really appreciated her thoughtfulness & kindness in having taken the time to do this. We had lunch outside on the terrace of the Bistro & we wondered if service would be slow as we were outside but it was very good, & so was our meal. We ate there in the evening & all was very good. We ate outside again the following morning for breakfast & service was again friendly yet professional. The food was excellent with plenty of choices. It was a tad clattery inside for our liking. Our waiters really seemed to enjoy working here which showed. We spent the day relaxing & enjoying the tranquility as although the pools are great for families with children we were able to sit quietly. Our bed was sooo comfy & I really liked the great make up mirror in the bathroom which not only magnified but also had settings for day & evening.

We really liked the artwork & stunning chandelier in the public areas. The elevators were quick even though this hotel is large.

We would liked to have met her to thank her personally for rescuing the end of our holiday. However, we did write her a note expressing our heartfelt thanks.

The grounds, the lobby, and especially the pool are immaculate. Everything was great at first glance and it mostly is. We get out of the car and we are helped by the bellboy with our luggage. The bellboy cart has one important feature missing: no bar at the top on which to hang the smaller bags. Small thing but nevertheless annoying when you want to keep some small bags in shape instead of piling everything on top of each other. Check in was a breeze. We got an early check in which I always appreciate, We also received (upon request) a late checkout of 1pm (normally 12pm). The room although super clean is fairly basic: small fridge, two double beds, nice views of the great pool and golf course, no bathrobe, one large screen TV, and the shower is inside the bath. As usual you don't get any freebies (no free bottled water) but you can purchase the two bottles of water on the desk for I think $5.50 each. The pool is perhaps the best feature of this hotel. Very spacious, very very clean wherever you look, plenty of towels, it also has a decent waterslide and a very decent lazy river. There is a small restaurant by the pool, a small gift shop, a kiddies pool and two jacuzzis. I can't fault the pool in any way, it is impeccable. And now to some not so positive aspects: parking is $13 per day. But, here's the annoying part, it is actually $13 +tax. Room service comes with a mandatory $3 delivery charge plus a mandatory 22% service fee out of which 17% is distributed equally to the staff and the hotel keeps the other 5% for administrative purposes. This 22% is of course +tax. And then when you sign there is also in big letters written on the bill a section entitled GRATUITY. What?? It's not enough to pay the $3 delivery fee + the mandatory 22% service fee (regardless of whether the service was great). No wonder the guy who delivered the room service was so keen to show us all the other sauces that came with the burger (ADDITIONAL gratuity was my guess). But now I must give credit where credit is due. My wife reckons the burger she ordered from room service was the best burger she ever had. She said it tasted even better than the one from Five Guys. The internet charges start at $4.95 for two hours or $9.95 for 24hrs. So despite the high cost to stay at this hotel everything else costs extra. Now the buses that take you to the parks. These are free and very comfortable but they only go to the 4 Disney Parks and downtown Disney (they don't go to the Disney Water Parks). They sometimes go once everyhour and depending which park you go to, it can take as much as 45min to get there because the same bus stops first at Magic Kingdom, then Epcot and then Disney Hollywood Studios. The ride to Hollywood Studios took us 45min. The buses are clean and are air conditioned. So consider wasting us much as 90 minutes to get to and back from a park depending on which park you get to. And of course add the extra time you need to allow yourself to be ready before the bus picks you up to take you to and from the park. We stayed for 9 days and the pen was never replaced. Actually it was replaced once when I left a note next to the tip i was leaving daily asking for an extra pen. Another annoying fact was sometimes you had to have certain lights on before you can use one of the power points. I was a little annoyed with one of the power points not working and when I rung the reception they told me I need to have some switch on before I can use the power point. Huh??? But at least it worked once I did what the receptionist told me. All in all we had a pleasant stay and although I recommend this hotel (magnificent pool) I do not think I will be returning because of the extra charges especially considering this is not exactly a cheap place to stay at.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWe love this hotel\u201d", "Author": "flyinghighFlorida", "ReviewID": "UR128188427", "Content": "We have stayed here many times with friends and family the pools are great actually all the resorts at bonnet creek are excellent.

The thing is that people think its theme park view and its not, you are not that close to magic kingdom to see it. you can see a bit of hollywood studios but thats it. It is however disney view since you are looking at the whole disney area, you cant expect to see cinderellas caste! the only complain I have is that housekeeping can take a while to enter the room, I went into my rooma couple of days around 3 pm and still the room wasnt done.

When we returned to the front desk to ask for a different room, we were offered a different room for additional $20.00. After refusing to pay for a different room, the clerk reluctantly reassigned us a room in a different tower, that was much closer to elevator (from 11th floor to 10th floor) Have to question why we were not given the room on the 10th floor initially and why it felt as though the clerk was doing us a favor by giving us a room that did not feel miles away from the elevator, and had a nice view of the pool. The pool was very nice, and we loved the lazy river. There seemed to be adequate chairs for everyone and we never had a problem grabbing a lounger. The staff placed cards on chairs that indicated your items would be removed if you were gone for an hour (no chair saving). Although the notices were placed on the loungers, we never say staff actually remove property. Good scare tactic though. With regards to pool service, waited for over an hour for someone to take our order. I ended up having to walk over to the middle section of the pool, where there were many waiters, to ask an employee to send someone to our area for service. Many others in our area were finally able to place orders after a manager stepped in to help out. She was great; super efficient, and made our stay much more enjoyable with her professionalism. The breakfast was good, but wish they offered hand sanitizers as the main breakfast was a buffet, with many hands touching the serving utensils. Lastly, our room was nice; however, we were very surprised that the comforter on the bed was merely tucked between a top and bottom sheet. There was no comforter cover, and to us, that was unsanitary. I sincerely doubt that the comforters are washed after each stay, and if not, they are exposed to bodily fluids from other guests, as two sheets do not keep it contained.

The Hilton and Waldorf Astoria are connected by a very large conference center and all facilities are offered to all guests. We stayed two nights at the Hilton with our two boys. The Hilton offers a spectacular pool complex with two large pools (one is zero-entry), waterslide, baby pool, two spas, and a lazy river that connects the two pools. The landscaping is gorgeous. There are countless chairs but we realized that guests must come down in the morning and stake claim because finding one in the afternoon was difficult. Floats can be rented or purchased but are not necessary. There is a nice restaurant/bar pool side but waitresses around the pool deck were few and far between. Our room and the common areas were very clean. Here are a few things to consider: (1) This hotel has one bank of elevators on one end of the hotel. When the front desk person tells you that you have a bit of a walk, you will experience the longest walk in the history of hotels. If that is a problem, request one closer to the elevator. We opted for a higher floor with a better view that still wasn't so great. (2) While he was very nice, the front desk clerk was a bit clueless about the resort credit package under which we were booked. After bringing it to his attention and a few phone calls, we received an envelope with our Disney gift card (one) and a card acknowledging the resort credit. Prior to booking the hotel, I made two calls and reviewed the website to understand this package. I was told I would receive a gift card for each night booked but when we checked in that was not the case. (3) This was my biggest frustration. We ate dinner at Aquamarine at the WA. We ordered an appetizer of fries as we were starving. Then, both of my boys requested fries instead of fruit with their meals. When our meal arrived, we had FOUR appetizer sized orders of fries and a bill for $18 worth of french fries! When we questioned the waiter, we were told that one order came with my meal (a lobster wrap that in a court of law, I couldn't testify that it actually contained lobster); one was the app, and two were ordered by the boys and could not be substituted for the fruit. Thanks for telling us after the meal. Obviously, the WA doesn't cater to children because this substitution is common across the US. Would we return, absolutely.

It was our bad time, but they had a huge convention there, so things were a bit crowded. As for the location - the property is on the Disney property itself. It's very close to the main Buena Vista, which takes you to Downtown Disney and I-4. There is a Wyndham property across the street along with the Waldorf that is connected to the Hilton Property. It was very quiet and peaceful there, but there's not much to do around the area other than hang out by the bar in the lobby or stay by the pool. There is golf on the property, but we didn't try that. The Rooms- We had a 2 queen room. Internet is NOT free (which is something Hilton should consider changing), but there is complimentary access in the lobby area. The room is your typical Hilton room....nothing much to rave about. Eating - We didn't eat in the restaurants. They have a nicer restaurant in the hotel and a family restaurant as well. Prices appeared to be typcial pricing for Hilton properties. They had a Bistro that offered coffee in the morning along with danishes and other pastries, but most mornings we chose to drive to Burger King or McD's at the end of Buena Vista. That saved us a LOT. The Pool - I think the kids liked the pool. They stayed there for quite some time so the fact they were down there a while is good. They enjoyed the lazy river, but if you're going during season - Spring/Summer, it seems many parents get down to the pool to reserve their spot at 7am. Evidently it seats fill up quickly around the pool. Would we go back? Probably not. I relied upon the Trip Advisor reviews for this hotel, but I think next time I would rather stay in a property that was within walking distance of Downtown Disney. I know there are the Doubletree, Holiday Inn, and another Hilton in that area. Parking in Downtown Disney is really bad (especially if you're seeing a show) and the Hilton only has transportation to the theme parks via bus. Getting in the car and shuffling in and out was just a lot of trouble. When you have teenagers, sometimes they can be easily entertained at Downtown Disney, so if they can walk there, while you remain at a restaurant or better yet, your room, I think it makes it much less stressful on the parent.

Disney is always an expensive proposition so it's nice to get a little break at the hotel. The kids also enjoyed the game room. I do agree with other reviewers that it is unfair that people claim chairs at 7am and keep them for the day even when they are not using them.

The reception is spacious and clean, it still feels new although it's 2 or 3 years old. Check in was simple but the directions to the lifts were not, it wasn't that they were hard to find just that there were 2 lift areas ( on the left the lifts went as high as 10, whlie the right lifts went from 11 to 17).Our room was on floor 16 but we foolishly got in the wrong lift, up to 10 thinking we could go higher but realising not had to come all the way back down just to go up again. It wasn't really a problem as the lifts were so fast we were there in seconds (less than 30 seconds from the doors closing to opening 16 floors up!). Our room was big, with 2 large double beds and a view towards Downtown Disney (DD) over the front of the hotel. The room was spotless and cleaned everyday, if required, but we didn't bother as we only used it to sleep and wash in so had the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign out quite a bit. Air-conditionong worked well and was much appreciated, as was the fridge, ideal for keeping drinks icy cold, especially the vodka! The only minor thing was that the shower wasn't very powerful and it took my wife ages to rinse her hair after washing it. Bar area was nice and all the staff were friendly and happy to chat, it was lovely to sit out on the balcony with a cold drink overlooking the pool after a long day at the parks. The prices of drinks seemed a little expensive but what would you expect in a 4/5 star hotel in the Disney area (from $6 for a pint or bottle of Bud). Just to the side of the reception bar is a cafe where we picked up sandwiches and cakes but they also sold hot and cold drinks, fruit, ice cream, pretzels, etc. We visited the pool bar once, it was nice and comfy but more expensive than the reception bar (which had a better view anyway). There is another bar in the hotel, which does karaoke, but we didn't use it. Both restaurants were good; La Luce is an Italian, the food was really nice and they had a good selection of bottled beers and wines, which seemed to get busier at weekends; The Harvest Bistro was a more general restaurant and was pleasant, but we mainly ate in and around Downtown Disney. Shuttles to the Disney Parks run regulary, are efficient and clean and timetables are available from reception or the shuttle buses. All of the parks are within 30 - 40 minutes, depending on which route the buses take but the nearest is only 10 minutes. The shuttles don't run to the disney water parks but Typhoon Lagoon is only a 5 minute drive, opposite DD ( if you haven't got a car you can jump on the shuttle to DD and cross the road to TL). The pool was refreshing after a hot, humid day. It was so relaxing just floating around on the lazy river with the stars above. I'm sure it would make a perfect rest day from the manic parks. The facilities of the neighbouring Waldorf Astoria are available for use, we definately recommend the Bull and Bear resaurant, a little pricey but the food is glorious, ideal for a special occasion. We couldn't have wished for anywhere better to stay,not loads of kids, not Disney but in its back yard, perfect.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "hawaii", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel - but be ready to be nickel and dimed to death\u201d", "Author": "frequenttraveler0129", "ReviewID": "UR127435811", "Content": "Overall our stay was very pleasant (5 nights during spring break). Be warned - this is a family hotel. Tons of little kids. We had a 10 year old and there weren't many his age there. The pool is 3 feet deep in most places (a couple of 4 foot places). The lazy river was a huge hit with the kids. If you want adult time you can go next door to the Waldorf (they share facilities) and it is adult world. The restaurants were all really good (and expensive). It is a very expensive resort overall. When I booked there were no rooms available and was told they could book a suite. So for double the price I got what I thought would be a one door room with a living area separated by a door from the bedroom. Much to my surprise, the \"suite\" was a HUGE living/dining/office/bathroom separated by double doors from a bedroom/bathroom. While it was lovely, they could easily have booked me just the room rather than give me a huge room I didn't need. The business office charges $0.69 per page for copies and $1 a minute for internet access. The internet charge is $10 a day (PER COMPUTER) - which seems ridiculous considering that wireless internet is free in the lobby and at the pool. Parking is $13+ for self parking. I am sorry, but when you are paying over $500 a night for a room such charges really seem overkill. Nice workout facility, and the spa at the Waldorf is nice (and really expensive). Great location (unless you want to go to the grocery store). Overall a really nice place but be prepared to spend some serious money.

We arrived in Orlando at around 11am and called to see if our room was available- lucky us it was! The staff at this hotel are absolutely top notch. When we first arrived there was a large profession convention consuming most of the hotel, and we looked like the Griswalds traveling to Disney. The staff treated us with equal importance and was incredibly attentive and gracious from the front desk all the way to checkout. We inadvertently left our \"do not disturb\" sign on the door when we went out for the day, and when we returned in the evening, a very kind housekeeping attendant said to us \"I did not want to disturb your room, but if you'd like I can step in and straighten it for you very quickly\"- it was kind and unexpected and in my opinion \"beyond the call of her duties.\" At the pool, there were countless very friendly employees who chatted with us about our trip, and seemed genuinely happy to be there. I can't tell you how refreshing this was as a consumer! We are the type of family that saves up and tries to make the most of our vacation time together, and staying in a nice place with even nicer service makes us feel we've received a tremendous value. NOW- down to the hotel! At check in I inquired about a \"fireworks view\"- which I was told i could have but not for early check in. We chose to go ahead and check in to room 971, and our view was LOVELY! We could see the entire pool area, Disney's MGM Studios, and to the far right we watched Fireworks in the Epcot Area! The \"bowling pins\" from Pop Century were visible (great because we had friends staying there and could \"wave at them\" in spirit!) The ONLY complaint, and it's so minor, is that this room was VERY far from the elevators, but better that than listening to people exiting the elevator all night I suppose, and I would not have traded the view! The beds were delightfully comfortable, and the TV was a nice large screen. The roll out table from under the desk was genius- it made a perfect dining table for pizza from our favorite place in Orlando - Giordanos! There was no phone book in the room, but a quick call to the concierge got us not only the phone number for Giordanos, but a special menu for the hotel with a FREE coupon for this hotel only for basil cheese bread. Heaven!! The bathroom was very roomy and the towels were large and soft. The rain shower head was very nice, and the bathtub was a nice size! Everything in this hotel seemed brand new and immaculate. We had one meal at the hotel, breakfast buffet at the Harvest Bistro, and it was fabulous. Kids eat free, so for $40 plus tax and tip we had an amazing breakfast for 4. The POOL is amazing, we had such a blast swimming like mermaids through the lazy river. We did bring our own tubes, but barely used them, it was fun to swim through with such little effort. At night the fireplaces at Beech were SUCH a treat. The water was warmer than the air, so when we got out and sat on the outdoor couches at Beech, we were in heaven. Overall, I would absolutely without question go back to the Hilton Bonnet Creek (again and again!) We love the Disney Hotels, but feel we received the same or better quality than a $450 a night deluxe Disney resort for the same price as a moderate Disney Hotel.

Beautiful hotel, GREAT pool area and fantastic service. We stayed for 8 days with our 6 & 7 year olds and had an awesome time. Our room was on the 12th floor, \"Disney view\". It was fun to be able to look out at the Disney area and catch fireworks now and again. My kids loved running to the window every morning to see the message on the pool chairs (written in rolled up towels - fun). They had a family-friendly DJ at the pool who ran games and played some fun music which was great. The poolside movies (on a giant inflatable screen) were a huge hit with the kids. The fire pits were also fun/relaxing to sit by at night (where are the s'mores Hilton???). The room was large enough for the 4 of us and had a good sized refrigerator. Handy because we stopped at the store for some kid drinks, snacks and wine/beer. The only downside to the room is the lack of a balcony (there aren't any at the hotel). This will actually prevent us from staying here again. It's nice to have a balcony to sit on and read / have a glass of wine when the kids go to bed. We had quite a few meals at the hotel and the food was actually very good. La Luce is one of the best restaurants we've been to anywhere (do not miss the fried olives!). Don't underestimate the Harvest Bistro. It's the main breakfast restaurant (really good breakfast), but their dinners were very, very good. We didn't expect that and were pleasantly surprised. We had the grouper, veal shank, burger and a pasta dish which were all excellent. The pool menu is typical and fine. I was disappointed that they only offered a limited menu by the pool over the weekend. The server told me it was because it was \"so busy\" (it wasn't) that they limit the options. The only item they were offering for kids was chicken tenders .... strange. I have to make mention of the breakfast servers who were all awesome. They were upbeat, friendly and on the ball. They greeted my kids every morning like long lost relatives. It was my twins' birthday one morning and our server brought them a little toy from the gift shop. They were THRILLED and talked about that all day. The Disney shuttle service is lacking, take your own car if you have one. Too many stops, too much time between return shuttles later in the day. Just an all around pain, we ended up taking a cab back from the Magic Kingdom. Speaking of the car .... $13 a day to park???? C'mon Hilton! Ridiculous.

The cleanliness and upkeep of the room was first class. We had breakfast every morning in the Harvest Bistro - highly recommended for its vast selection of excellent food. We were welcomed every morning by the lovely Chantelle and her colleagues (who are so friendly and made us feel very special) and Luis, the manager of the Harvest Bistro who always ensured he came to speak whenever he saw us. We had met the wonderful John-Paul on our first visit last June - he was our server and gave us first class service at breakfast - and we were lucky enough to have JP as our server on most mornings this visit. Rest assured that all the staff at the Harvest Bistro are led by example by Luis and they are all very friendly and helpful, ensuring your every need is taken care of. We visited the Concierge desk on a couple of occasions - again, the staff were excellent - particularly Vicky and Nicole. They both ensured our requests for assistance had been met by 'phoning our room to speak to us personally. All the staff, without exception, gave us excellent service, made us feel so special and went that extra mile to ensure that we enjoyed every minute of our stay. This hotel is in a wonderful location, has beautiful surroundings and facilities that are equal, if not better, than some of the more expensive Disney hotels.

I approached the concierge team for help, they decided that would help us out by going to a local supermarket order a cake and put a special message on it for our daughter, they then arranged with disney to get the cake to the restaurant so that it would be ready for us. This is no mean feat and was done in less than 24 hours! If that was not good enough we then lost the same daughters soft toy (Goofy) which she has had since she was born and is a much a part of the family as a slightly smelly soft toy can be. She goes to sleep every night stroking Goofy's ear against her nose! We knew that we had lost him at Animal kingdom, again I asked the concierge for help believing all was lost.

The room was modern and spotless. It was large enough and a comfortable place to be. The hotel has a few restaurants and cafes. Service was usually very good and sometimes outstanding.

We enjoyed the amenities this property offered. The location near Disney World was nice, easy to get onto I-4 and avoid the Downtown Disney/Hotel area traffic which was a nightmare. The actual Bonnet Creek location is really off the beaten path, and easy to get in and out of. Parking was easy at the garage, $13 per day, and you use your room key card to get in and out. This is also a large convention area attached, which connects the Hilton and the adjacent Waldorf Astoria. There were numerous conferences going on while we were there, but it didn't feel too crowded or busy. The breakfast buffet was large with many food options and very tasty. If you are a Diamond Hilton Honors member you get the \"cold\" buffet free, and for $6 you can get eggs/omelets cooked to order and the other standard \"hot\" buffet items. It was worth the price to upgrade more than once. We also ate at the coffee shop off the lobby - very good (and large) pastries (you can choose this instead of the buffet as a Diamond amenity). The pool areas are superb. The lazy river, waterslide, zero entry, and hot tubs were very good. The entire pool area was not crowed at all during our stay, always plenty of chairs to be had. We also walked across the street to the Wyndham resort to check it out. They had many pools and a nice walking path/boardwalk area around their central lake. I wanted to point out there is a kiddie playground with swings and slides. We did take our son over there more than once and he enjoyed it. This was really the only thing the Hilton didn't have that we would have liked. I am giving 4 out of 5 stars based on not getting an upgrade to a better room based on my Diamond status (they told me none available), having to pay to upgrade the breakfast buffet, and the cable TV had spotty service during our stay - some channels always worked, others had the signal cutting in and out the whole time, and some never worked. I didn't complain because we weren't there to watch TV, but it was annoying when channel flipping at night.

I had read the many positive reviews, so I was pretty excited to see if they were indeed true. The resort is very easy to find. It is on Disney grounds and very close to the Swan/Dolphin and Hollywood Studios. We arrived at 8:20am from Ft. Myers, as we wanted to take advantage of a whole day at the park. Knowing there was a possibility we would not be able to check in until 3:00pm, which is their advertised check-in time, I was surprised when I was told our room was ready and we could bring up our luggage. This was great, as we definitely would not have been in the mood for this after a long day/night at the park. As soon as you pull up there are bellmen and valet attendants waiting to help you out of your vehicle. I went straight to check in and the service was pleasant, welcoming, and prompt. We were checked in and in our room within 10 mins. You can choose to either self park ( $13 a day ) or valet. We chose to self park, in which you are directed to a large parking garage. There are elevators, however, in the garage that take you to a bridge to connect you to the hotel. Our room was on the 11th floor with a beautiful view of Downtown Disney in the distance. There are two queen-sized beds, a decent-sized bathroom, flat screen television, and a desk. Could be we were exhausted from our day at the Magic Kingdom that caused us to sleep so well, but we both agreed that the beds were super comfortable, with a faux down comforter and many pillows. It was hard to pull ourselves out of bed the next morning. The day we checked in, we decided to do Magic Kingdom. The hotel provides complimentary transportation to all parks and Downtown Disney and the bus used is wonderful. It is comparable to a travel bus, with comfy seats, movies playing for the children, and lights and a/c control above your head. The bus only makes one stop to its sister hotel, the Waldorf Astoria immediately next door, and then you're on your way to the park. Unlike Walt Disney World Resort buses and Dowtown Disney hotel buses which make many pit stops to pick up additional guests, this bus only caters to the Hilton and Waldork Astoria, so there are fewer people, much more quiet, and it gets you to where you want to go in a short period of time. It was also nice coming back from the park at night not having to drive our own cars and having a peaceful ride back to the hotel, unlike Disney Resort guests, who we saw crammed in the buses, with many standing. It's the little things that can really add enjoyment to your trip. The only thing to keep in mind if going to the Magic Kingdom, is that the bus does not take you straight to the park itself. It will take you the Ticket and Transportation Center, in which you must board a ferry or monorail to get to the Magic Kingdom. So, allow yourself a few extra minutes to do this in planning your Magic Kingdom day. You'll also have to return back to the Ticket and Transportation Center at the end of your park stay to get back on the bus. The Disney bus stop is directly in front of the hotel, so very little walking required and easy to find. The rooms are modernly decorated. You will not experience the Disney feel at this hotel, but I feel kids will still thoroughly enjoy it as there is a beautiful pool area with waterslide and lazy river. There are restaurants to choose from and a quick grab-and-go coffee shop next to the entrace for pastries/danish/bagels/ice cream. I wish we would have had more time to explore the hotel, but with a quick two day schedule, that wasn't the case. I definitely intend to stay here again on my next Disney visit and have already recommended it to others. The price is very comparable to a Disney resort, and actually cheaper, the rooms are twice the size, extremely clean, have queen beds, which many Disney resorts still use double, and an excellent view.

The hotel employee tells me that it should be five minutes..I tell her to just have them bring me some the next day. At 1:30am there is a knock on my door, but I was already I n bed half asleep. And they never brought me those hangers the next day. -I left change in the bathroom and while I of course would've tipped housekeeping at the end ofmy stay,I was shocked to notice that the change was gone the next day! T me that's appalling - and finally, while the food at the pool bar area was very good, the service was horrible. I had to wait for awhile and ask for a waiter...and then two hours later, with the waiter checking in one, I had to ask twice for my waiter to come give me the check.

I have to tell you that this resort did not disappoint!! Everything about it was top-notch, from the employees to the impeccable grounds to the gorgeous rooms...five star all the way! Check in was fast and to my absolute delight, I was given an incredible upgrade due to my Diamond status (thank you, Bill!!). The room was breathtaking, and so was the view of the pool. Ahhh.....the pool! It is beyond beautiful! The entire pool complex is just stunning and sparkling clean. The water is heated \"just right\", the jacuzzis are so inviting, and the attendants were wonderful and were frequently stopping by with complimentary goodies (frozen grapes, chocolates, etc.). The food at the poolside bar/restaurant was excellent...best chicken quesadilla's ever, and the portions are enormous for the price! And when it gets chilly, they even have fire-pits poolside. We just completely fell in love with the entire experience at the pool. It was a large enough area that families with kids could \"do their thing\", while those seeking tranquility had their own space. We even skipped going to the theme parks for 3 days to just spend the day by the pool! The room was meticulously clean upon our arrival, and housekeeping had it serviced upon our return every night with yummy chocolates waiting for us on the pillows! The rooms had all the great little \"extra touches\" of luxury...great bath products, comfy robes, large flat screen tvs with channel guides (so you didn't have to keep flipping and guessing!), fast wifi, refrigerators, and of course heavenly beds!! Every single employee we encountered was personable and courteous, from the valets to the housekeepers to the front desk attendants. Self-parking is plentiful and only a short walk to the lobby. We did utilize the free park shuttle one day and there were dozens of options for drop-off/pick-up times which saved money parking at the theme parks. We also used the fitness center every morning and it was sparkling clean and we even noted how the attendant did the most thorough wipe-down/disinfecting of the equipment that I have ever seen!! We did stroll over to the adjoining Waldorf Astoria property and considered using their pool one day but decided we liked the one at the Hilton much better! All in all, this was such a wonderful stay for us and I am thrilled to recommend this resort to anyone! If it's any testimony to how much we loved the resort, then you should know that we extended our stay TWICE and made a 3 day weekend a 5 day weekend!!

Arriving by shuttle, I noticed that Bonnet Creek is about the only turn inside of Disney World that is not marked with a large sign like all of the other turns and hotel entrances--maybe because it is on property not owned by Disney. From the main road inside of Disney World, it is is another 5-10 minute drive alongside a golf course. The hotel itself has a grand driveway. Doormen jump to it to open your door and offer to take luggage. The check in desk was fully staffed with no one being served, so that everyone in my 3 person group checked in simultaneously. I never saw a line there despite going past several times each day. My room was 404. The hall was quiet and brightly lit as was the room. I never heard any of my neighbors except for occasional door-closing sounds from the hallway. The room door was solid and heavy, but not heavy enough to actually latch without an additional push. I just had to be careful arriving and leaving that it actually closed, a minor security problem. The room was spacious with a king bed, desk with pull out extra semi-oval table, office chair, lounge chair and ottoman, large flat screen TV, refrigerator, no mini-bar (a plus in my mind), coffee maker with 4 packets of coffee and 1 decaf and teabags. I carefully avoided touching the 1 liter bottles of water with prominent $5 price tags. The tap water was just fine for drinking. Lamps all had extra plugs at their bases for phone chargers or computer chargers. The bed was enormous and quite comfortable. The office chair was painfully hard and the lounge chair was so-so in comfort in odd contrast with the bed. There was a reasonable but unlighted closet with plenty of hangers for clothes. There was an ironing board and iron but no safe. The bathroom was average sized for an American hotel with bright lights. The counter was granite with a tile floor. The shower was about 6 feet long and 3-4 feet wide with a clear glass enclosure. The shower head was a broad one that normally delivers the equivalent of heavy rain. However, my room never got truly hot water. The toilet was a silent one that appeared to use a low volume flush. All the towels and linens were very high quality or luxurious. There were enormous high quality green towels at the pool and small white towels in the gym. The pool has a lazy river connecting three pools, one of them next to Beech, the poolside bar. The fireplaces were quite charming. There was also a water slide which seemed like lots of fun judging from the reaction of several kids. Water temperature was perfect, and the hot tubs were quite nice too. Signs warn that there is no lifeguard, but the deepest water was only 4 feet. Looks like parents do have to pay attention with small kids (but when don't we?). I think internet access was prepaid for my group. It was painless to sign in, and it worked well both as a hard wired connection and a wireless connection. Phone calls on my ATT cell phone were painfully noisy in my room and in the meeting rooms when the connections weren't dropped which seemed odd for a high-end resort hotel. Meeting rooms were as expected in furnishings but each participant had a bit more space than usual at meeting tables which was nice. Food for the meetings was outstanding. All the service people throughout the hotel were courteous and friendly. After check out, I had a long wait for my ride to the airport and was able to use the gym after they issued me a gym only key. There is a free shuttle to the Magic Kingdom and to Downtown Disney, but it takes a painful 40 minutes to get to Downtown Disney. A cab ride was 15 minutes due to traffic and about 10 dollars. We didn't try the half hourly Disney buses that go only to the Disney Transportation Center requiring transfers to anywhere else. Overall, it was very, very good as a hotel with just a few minor misses. I'd return for a business trip. For a family going on a vacation featuring Disney World though, I noticed that the Disney World Flavor was quite subdued, which might be a plus or a minus depending on your point of view.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLooking for a hotel where money are stolen from the room?\u201d", "Author": "InessaK", "ReviewID": "UR124498043", "Content": "They were looking through our staff and stole money.

We decided to drive from New York to Orlando and while the ride was exhausting , our stay at this hotel made it all worthwhile. Everyone was courteous, professional and went out of their way make sure we were comfortable. Here is quick breakdown of the hotel- Lobby- Nice and clean with plenty of places to sit. There is a nice bar area off to the lobby area with generous seating both inside and out(the outside area has seating that overlooks the pool). Hotel Hallways and elevator- Pristine, clean with no odor. Rooms- beautiful, spacious and clean. My only complaint was that Wifi was not free. Restaurants- La Luce \u2013 Really nice Italian Restaurant in the hotel, with great food and even greater service. (nice size meal portions as well) Harvest Bistro- The Buffet Style Breakfast was just outstanding, and although very crowded each morning we were seated promptly and the staff was extremely attentive to all the guests needs. The breakfast itself consisted of everything from cereal, Danishes, and bagels to waffles ,eggs and pancakes. Muse- good coffee shop, great for a late night cup or early morning jolt. (tip.. try their ice cream, its pretty good) FYI The hotel is connected to the Waldorf so if you want a different dining options, you can eat in a different hotel without having to go outside. The Fitness Area- Great for a hotel with plenty of elliptical and Treadmills (all high quality). Also there was a good assortment of other equipment for weight training. Even more impressive was that all the equipment was in perfect working condition, this area was really well maintained . My opinion, this gym is more than adequate for anyone who wants to keep up their fitness routine while on vacation. Pool- Aaah the lazy river- The pool was beautiful and the great thing about it was that no matter how many people were in it , the pool never felt over crowded(it\u2019s just that big). Tip- get a float and allow the lazy river to sweep you along the pool at a nice relaxing pace. In the pool area there are also some relaxing whirlpools that are a perfect escape from the regular pool. Tip- don't get bummed out if it rains a little(that's Florida) the Hilton crew did a great job of clearing the pool if there was impending lightning, and getting everyone back to the fun quickly when the all clear was given. The communication from the staff was a thing of perfection. Complimentary shuttle service- Leave your car in the lot at the hotel. Hilton Bonnet Creek shuttle service was perfect. They were on time courteous and ran all day and night (to every Disney park!) the shuttle service was just a few steps away from the main lobby. The hotel was no more than 15 mins to all Disney attractions by shuttle Concierge- Everything you can want in hotel customer service and then some. There was one night the four of us wanted to go eat somewhere outside of Disney, the concierge spent over 20 minutes with us going through different local dining options and calling up places for reservations, it was customer service at its best(and they seemed to do it all the time).

The room doors are heavy and there was no hallway noise in our room which is a good thing! Lobby gathering area is all bar seating but kids were very present during the day and seemed welcome. La Luce is the upscale dining option and was wonderful but pricey. The more casual dining option had a limited menu during our stay, a bit pricey but decent food. The hotel has shuttles to the various Disney parks which makes life easy. Th room was spacious - king bed desk area, one chair with ottomon. Bath was spacious, shower only if that is a concern. Small closet. Lots of outlets, and two on each side of the bed at the lamp base which is a great perk for me-- hate having to unplug things behind nightstands to recharge my various istuff!

The hotel is located close by the Disney property and with the regular (and prompt) coach service, you are not really any further away from the parks as many Disney properties. The kids eat free at Harvest Bristo is a great comp and ensures most families eat there, leaving La Luce free of most families. We dined at the hotel in both restuarants 5 nights and enjoyed both very much. The service was great. The pool complex is wonderful and our only regret was not spending more than a morning there. The pool is huge and given a few chilly days is was great that it was heated. A recent review commented on Eric the life guard who was very friendly, and in a moment of poor parent supervision, pulled my daughter from a lazy river when she got into some difficulty. We had pool view rooms which provided a great view of that complex, the adjacent golf course and nightly Disney fireworks. My main piece of advice relates to the Town Cars servicing the hotel, and that is to make sure they check the company's price sheet when setting the fare.

I am a Hilton Honors member so we were given complimentary wi-fi in the room, a high floor and late check out which was nice since most hotels charge for that. The room was emaculate and very clean. The bed was AMAZINGLY comfortable. There was a flat screen television and even a fridge which you sometimes dont find in hotels. I really loved the walk in shower (I HATE tub/shower combos at hotels). We were on the 17th floor and had a view of downtown disney....gorge. We had the breakfast buffet at the Harvest something or other and it was your normal buffet, nothing spectacular. We didnt get in the pool, but did walk around the pool area which seems really nice. It has a water slide, lazy river and about 4 or 5 separate pools in all. Upon Checkout the girl was borderline rude.

Nice racket the hotel has going on. I called to express my concerns to Olivia at the main number and she spoke to me in a patronizing tone. To this date, my credit card has NOT been refunded. Another employee who would only reveal himself as \"the operator\" hung up on me twice. I could not get a live person on the phone past the main number. The valets burned rubber in the parking garage and almost hit me as a pedestrian as they rounded a corner. DO NOT let the valets park your car unless you want the body work altered or the paint scratched.

Food was ridiculously expensive even for a Hilton hotel, but the price of a premium rum was the same for a Captain Morgan! ($9.59) My husband and I had the buffet at the Harvest Bistro and felt ill after wards. We spent the rest of the afternoon laying by the pool and saw staff in green shirts offering other people towels and such, but they stayed away from us as if we had the plague. Others in blue shirts were supposedly servers delivering food and drinks to other people in lounge chairs, but no one came by us with a menu. I guess not everyone is entitled to the Hilton experience. The AC duct in the room smelled like a swamp and made a rattling noise. The TV did not work as if the signal was bad, and the view was terrible because it was of a Disney hotel that was not yet finished. The beds were comfortable but so are the ones at a Hampton Inn which is a fraction of the cost. While my husband was trying to sleep, I decided to take a walk around the property. While at the Waldorf side, (the two hotels are connected) I went to the Aquamarine bar. I was approached by a rude man in a white turtleneck and black blazer who demanded to see my room key. I did not have it on me, but told him I was a guest at the Hilton side. I was told to leave the area, and that the pool was for Waldorf Astoria guests only. I did not know the hotel was like the South in the 60s, where certain people were not to mingle with others. I did not get this man's name, but he spoke with a Russian or Ukraine accent. This hotel did not do much for me as a traveler and I felt uncomfortable for most of the stay. If I were a white businessman spending hundreds of dollars maybe my husband and I would have been treated differently. I will never again return to this property.

We unfortunatley did not make reservations and La Luce could not seat us right away. No problem, we could only blame ourselves for that one. We decided to have a few drinks at the small Sena Bar in the lobby while we waited for our table. Not wanting to sit at the bar but in comfortable chairs, we waited for someone to come by. A cocktailer in her twenties was standing at the bar chatting with two other girls and the bartender. I got up and walked up to the bar but before I could say anything the one girl barked at me that she would be there in a minute. Excuse Me! She went back to her conversation and did not smile once while at our table. When my wife asked about the wine, the waitress rolled her eyes and answered questions as if we were a nuisance wasting her precious gossip time. She left the table to get our drinks. I wanted to see the scores of a game on the bottom of a television screen so I walked up to the bar and stood behind a chair. The bartender glared at me like I was taking up a seat even though the bar was empty. I did notice him pouring one bottle of wine into another to empty the one bottle, and it happened to be my wife's wine. I had him open another bottle because I did not want her drinking wine like that. He grunted but opened a fresh bottle. we realized going to that bar was a big mistake so we paid our tab and went to wait outside. I had talked to a front desk manager Miguel, a younger Hispanic gentleman about this incident and he apologized for it. He also would have his Manager Tracy Walker contact me. This lady never did and no one else has either. When I tried calling the hotel all they did was forward me to a voicemail on multiple occasions. The final time I made it clear I did not want to speak to a machine but a real person, but the girl sent me to another voicemail of the Assistant Director. Now I am taking this rude behavior to the corporate level and find out why no one has called me back to discuss this matter. This is proof-positive that hotel managers shy away from crisis and complaints and only want to show themselves when they want to look good.

First, our room did not have any soap and the attending housekeeper had left her toilet brush in the bathroom! We called down to housekeeping and the lady who answered the phone was short with me, but would send someone up with soap and to re-clean the bathroom. We stayed during an unusual cold period so we needed the heater at night, but only cold air came out which made it colder inside than outside. Two days of trying to call someone to inspect this heater, and no one came. We had to resort to ordering extra sheets. Second, while out by the pool, something blew in my eye and I went to the small restroom next to the bar to take my contact out. Inside was a waitress from the Beech Bar and she walked right out without washing her hands! I guess Hilton employees do not have to wash their hands before returning to work. (Definitely were no signs posted indicating so) My husband had ordered a beer by the pool and the beer had expired back in November! I pointed this out to the bartender and he was very curt in the matter stating beer did not expire, but had a suggested best before date. Fine, that being said who would want to enjoy a beer after the \"suggested best before date\"? (Especially a beer that costs $8! It should be near fresh out of the brew kettle) Learn to rotate your beer people. Third and last came an erroneous item on our bill. The bill stated we bought items from the lounge using our room number. I refused to pay for the unknown items because anyone could have written any room number, and even challenged them to find the receipt that charged the item, while mentioning the it would not be either of our handwriting. The item was taken off, albeit reluctantly but removed nonetheless. I wanted to bring the above concerns to someone in authority so I had asked for the hotel manager and no one was around. They took down my information and allegedly gave it to a desk manager who said they would be in touch. Guess what? No one has returned my call. When I try to call the hotel manager they are always either too busy or have left for the day.

Mom, dad and pre-teen went down for a 3v3 soccer tournament and we had a great experience. First let me preface by saying we are Diamond members but most of the staff did not know this. We were upgraded to a great room with a Disney view and we were able to get full buffet breakfast for a minimal cost (due to Diamond status). Our daughter ate for free. The restaurant staff was great every single day and the food choices were awesome. Our soccer playing daughter was able to get very healthy food to fuel her body. It was honestly the only decent meals we had while we were in the area as we are not big hamburger, chicken fingers in the park type people. I don't normally eat the pre-made scrambled eggs at any restaurant and I ate them here nearly every day. I am a picky, picky eater so that says something right there. Only not so good thing in the breakfast was the coffee...a little tough. Oh yes, I forgot our meal at La Luce. It was also very good and well serviced, though we were so tired it is a bit of a fog. We saw people in the pool and we assumed they were from Canada, but then found out that it was heated to 81 farenheit which really surprised me given how large the pool is. That being said, we did not give it a try as we are from Dallas and expect the pool to be a bit warmer than that. We did enjoy looking out every morning to see what friendly little saying the pool towels spelled out for the day. They had a new word each day. We could also easily see the fireworks at Epcot each night which was a nice treat. I believe the odd numbered rooms have the Disney view. The only issue we had during our stay was with the bar in the lobby. Service was not good at all. When brought to the attention of the concierge that night we were sent a lovely bottle of red wine and cheese, crackers and fruit with an apology note. It was a nice gesture. I assure you (outside of this one situation) throughout our stay all the staff were beyond friendly. We plan to return in December with all the kids. We have stayed at many hotels in the Disney area and have chosen this one to return to due to the comfort of the beds, the morning breakfast (and it's value for Diamond members) and the friendliness of the staff...and the quiet in the rooms. That being said, if I were a first time visitor to Disney World or a parent with younger children I would probably stay at a Disney property only because there is not quite the \"magic\" to this resort that you would find at a Disney centric property. This hotel does seem more geared to adults and older children which is a big bonus for our family. I must give a big shout out to the front desk for taking care of the situation on the 14th floor (unattended young teens running wild). We couldn't hear the kids in our room, but it was still bad hotel behavior and we noticed on the way to the elevator. It was addressed immediately which is a nice thing to know if you want to have peace in your room. As previously mentioned some of the rooms are far from the elevators which to some is an annoyance but to our family a big bonus. I personally would prefer to walk a little further to and from our room in order to ensure peace.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cHilton Bonnet Creek, Orlando (Disney World)\u201d", "Author": "Windstorm_12", "ReviewID": "UR123312377", "Content": "The bell men were out front dancing when we arrived on 1/10 and too busy looking at each other in the glass to see us pull in and get out of our taxi.

A well-rounded breakfast before 7am is only available via room service, sadly, and cafe items are very limited, however all restaurants on property are very good. Breakfast buffet can cost you a $50. for three. Kids club in sister-property (attached) was great. Pool and lazy river are a huge hit with kids but no life guards and a challenging pool for parents to keep an eye on their child due to large size and disjointed layout; but lovely to relax at. We like the happy messages written on lounge chairs with towels each day at poolside. Thanks to Erik Lewis, Pool staff on duty, saved a little girl from the swift current on 1/16 - which impressed all the parents around that witnessed this. Erik also has a breathe of knowledge on the area, hotel and sister property that were invaluable to our visit. He was professional, courteous, articulate and seemed to have a command of respect about him - to the point I thought he was the manager and frankly, we think he should be after what we saw that day.

I have read other reviews that complained about the \"Disney View\" not being of the Castle, or other major icons, but that is slightly impossible becasue the hotel is situated and where its located. The hotel is a little over 5 miles away from Magic Kingdom, so unless your superman your not going to be able to sit in your room and look at the castle.

Furnature was dark hard woods, bathroom was polished granet countertops, bathroom was a large glass stall shower. The bed was prefect, we fell asleep right away. The rooms black out blinds were thick, so thick that at 9am, if you didnt look at a clock or go pull the blinds aside you would not know it was daylight outside. The pool looked very nice, however with lows in the upper 40's and highs in the 60's we did not want to get in. It has a long lazy river with bridges and fountains all over. If I am able to go back I plan to utalize the area. The lounge chars were made of a nice mesh rather then plastic straps. We did have brekfast down at the Harvest Bistro. The buffet was nice, its was $20.00 per person, and concidering somewhere like \"Chef Mickeys\" that has 1/2 the slections cost 2x more it was well worth it. They had everything you would expect, and an omlet and beljan waffel station. Parking was the only downside to the entire resort/hotel.

However, the only blemish on an othersie perfect stay would be the valet drivers. They go flying through the lot, sometimes a bit recklessly.

The location I felt was spot on, nice quiet area slightly away from the main highways but simple and quick to get onto the I4 and also very simple to get to the Disney parks as well as restaurants and bars located one junction up off the I4. firstly, the hotel pool is a great time passer as it has a slid for the young ones and a gentle lazy river to go round on, on a inflatable tyre. The pool temperature is also warm enough to make it inviting. the location is top notch for the Disney parks, we used the hotel shuttle several times to Downtown Disney, Magic kingdom and Animal Kingdom, it was always on time, ran from 9am-11pm, the coach was clean, tidy and easily identifiable and showed Disney movies onboard to get you into the Disney spirit.... on to the rooms, we were allocated a standard twin room which we found large, had great comfy beds, flat screen TV with endless channels, fridge, the usual essentials and plenty of storage area. The bathroom was of high standard, however I enjoy highly pressurised showers and this one was a bit lame. The grounds of the hotel were accumulate, the d\u00e9cor was smart and the inside of the hotel including the lobby and communal areas were spotless. There was a nice coffee shop and also an authorised Disney store within the hotel which could sell Disney tickets if you required them. I didn\u2019t unfortunately have chance to eat within the hotel as we were out most days at one of the numerous attractions however the bars looked like busy and popular hotspots on a Friday and Saturday night. If I had to point out a few negatives, firstly the parking cost feels like you are being robbed daily, $13 US to park within the hotel, over a week to get a near $100 bill feels like the hotel are just squeezing its clients. Secondly, there was no kettle, just a coffee maker within the room, admittedly it was fairly easy to make tea from this, but if you only have 2 plastic disposal cups a day, this is not enough for anything more than 1 round of drinks. So, in summary, if you have kids and are looking for a high standard hotel near Disney and the Lake Buena Vista area, this comes highly recommended!", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cMarathon Weekend Champs!!!\u201d", "Author": "ZMTampaRunner", "ReviewID": "UR122777498", "Content": "We stayed at this property for the Disney Marathon & Half Marathon weekend.

The property is very clean and very well run. The room rates were very reasonable both times we stayed there but beware of the hidden charges. Parking and wifi are extra. There are many restaurants on both the Hilton and Waldorf properties. We went out for dinner but breakfast and lunch at any of the restaurants was very good. Don't miss out on walking over to the Waldorf for lunch. The buffet breakfast did get pretty crowded and it's can be too much food. If you order off the menu the portions are more than sufficient. Look for the crazy Italian waiter. He's a lot of fun, great with kids. You'll know him when you see/hear him. The pool with it's lazy river, water slide, and outdoor movies is great for kids. Pretty nice for adults too. We were there for three weekdays before Christmas 2011 and the pool wasn't crowded. Either we picked the right days for our stay or everyone was at Disney. But you could easily keep the family there for the day and let the kids run wild in the pool. I will say that even though 95% of the pool is only 3' deep, I felt there was a lack of lifeguards so I would be careful with smaller children trying to navigate the current and traffic of older kids on the lazy river. You have to rent the inner tubes each day. Pick up a few inflatable pool-style inflatable rafts (Short ones. long won't fit down the river.) and stuff them in your suitcase. The hot tub was only slightly warmer than the pool. Wifi was weak by the pool, which works out if you're trying to kick your internet addiction while on vacation. But I did notice a few people occupying the lobby chairs where they could get better reception. Wifi in the room worked just fine. Typical size hotel gym but all the equipment was new, clean, and worked so well that it made me realize how bad the equipment is at my home gym. The property is connected to the Waldorf via a sizable conference/ballroom center and while I wasn't there on a business trip, I've certainly spent enough time at conferences to be able to size up the place. It's a very nice property for a conference. The Spa at the Waldorf is a little smaller than I was expecting but the massage therapists are very good. Our only real complaint is the music. They've got music piped into every corner of the property from the pool to the parking lot and it's just too much. If I want to listen to music I'll put my headphones on.

It was as close to perfect as it can get. We were booked in a double queen room on the 15th floor overlooking their amazing pool area. Off in the distance were the Disney parks. The room was spacious, comfortable and impeccably clean. I can only find one fault with the room and that is the shower nozzle. My preference is one that allows me to adjust how the water streams and this one did not. The maid service was timely and turn down in the evening happened seamlessly. We valeted the car for $20 a day. The car stayed in the garage our entire visit because we used the shuttle service to go to the Magic Kingdom one day and the Animal Kingdom the next. The shuttle driver warned us that because the parks were so crowded that they had not been permitted into the A.K. for pick ups the previous day and that it was possible we would need to take the Disney shuttle to the transfer center where the Hilton/Waldorf shuttle would definitely be able to pick up. We did not have this issue, but it was nice to be warned of the possibility. The shuttle picked up and dropped off at the times stated, making it easy to plan accordingly. One afternoon we took advantage of the pool and hot tub. The pool is zero-entry making it easy for young children and older people to enter. There is a lazy river wrapping around the pool complex. The depth is no more than 3 feet. A tube for the river can be rented for $5 a day. The beach towels are plentiful so take two in order to cover the lounge chair completely. Each evening we could see people down in the pool enjoying a movie on a huge screen. Around the entire complex of the Hilton and Waldorf is a nice walking/jogging trail. It is about a mile in total and it's a nice way to unwind or get a little exercise. Each morning we ate the Harvest Bistro. We were there fairly early around 7am and never had issue with waiting. We opted to eat from the menu rather than the buffet. They have a delicious smoothie and zucchini muffin combo. They also serve the most delicious arugula (drizzled with a touch of olive oil and sprinkling of salt) alongside their omelets. I never would have thought to have arugula with breakfast, but I will now! My brother ordered toast with his omelet and said it was very good bread. It looked rustic and homemade. One of the evenings we popped into Zeta to have a cocktail because it was quieter than the lobby bar. We ended up having an excellent sushi dinner there in addition to the cocktail we went in to have. I'm wondering if this restaurant recently opened because the staff still seemed to be getting their bearings and tweaking their service a little. No matter, they were attentive and wanted to make certain we were enjoying everything we tried. There is also a Disney Store near Zeta at the end of the lobby. While it's not huge like the Disney Store in Downtown Disney, it did have a nice assortment of last minute gift items that we were able to purchase for family members. The store also has the normal hotel store sundries. On the evening of the 30th the Hilton treated guests to fireworks over the golf course. I don't know if this was done because of year end or if they periodically have fireworks to entertain the guests. Regardless, it was a nice surprise. Would I stay here again? Absolutely!

The conference was actually located at the Downtown Disney Hilton but considering that the rates were the same and this hotel was new I decided to stay here and deal with a 5 minute drive. The hotel offers self parking (for a fee), but I used the valet for my entire stay. The car was always quickly available and I was greeted by name each time I called down. I arrived late so checkin was a breeze. The front desk staff were friendly and very welcoming. As a hhonors Diamond I was upgraded to Disney view room on a upper floor and provided with certificates to eat the continental breakfast in the Harvest Bistro restaurant. The certificates were also accepted in the coffee lounge (not the bar) off the main lobby. In the restaurant they could be upgraded for 6$ to the full buffet. The room was your typical modern Hilton decor. It had a walk-in shower (no tub). I personally love a large shower so this was a great plus. You would be surprised how many Hilton's haven't even upgraded to a curved shower rod yet. There's always some sort of conference going on so there's always activity in the lobby level bar area. There's a more dance style club a little farther down (towards the Waldorf) that plays TOP40 music with a DJ. Both were quiet busy during my entire stay. I don't have any kids but the pool area if a kids paradise. The whole pool complex is surrounded by a lazy river (you have to rent tubes if you want) and offers several beach entries. There's a slide as well as at least two hot tubs located around. Unfortunately as the pool area is fenced in it gets locked down -- which prevents late hot tub use. The hotel had a great Gym area with a ton of cardio equipment. Oddly enough I couldn't find any steam/sauna/locker area?! Hard to believe you'd neglect this in a new construction. The Waldorf and Hilton share bus service to the parks which runs about ever 30 mins. Or you could do some \"shopping\" at downtown Disney and leave your car there and use the Disney transportation system. Although I'm sure Disney doesn't appreciate this, so don't tell them I suggested it. (That's the downside of this Hilton, as the other ones at Downtown Disney you can easily walk over).

As much as I have enjoyed our stays at various Disney deluxe resorts, it's going to be really hard to justify paying more than twice as much for a Disney hotel when we know how great the Hilton is. We had stayed for three nights during Spring Break for less than $190/night. This time, I booked a 2-queen room with HHonors points and selected e-upgrades for a high floor and a suite. When the e-upgrades came though ($135 per night), we were absolutely blown away by the size of the \"parlor\"; it is equal to two rooms. You can see an example floor plan at http://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/content/ORLHHHH/media/pdf/en_ORLHHHH_Hilton_Deluxe_Suite.pdf. 1,200+ square feet were more than our family of 4 knew what to do with. The leather couch was comfortable enough for one to sleep on as-is, though it is a queen-size foldout. In addition to all the extra furniture, it was nice to have that huge open space by the wet bar where we could leave all out luggage, still easily accessible but completely out of the way. Service was nearly impeccable throughout our stay. Staff knew my name in just about every instance when they could reasonably be expected to find out. Little extra touches make me suspect that they were also aware of my Diamond status. The only miss was one time (out of seven) that I requested my car from the valet and it took nearly 30 minutes (with two additional asks) before I had it. The quick valet service every other time enables me to recommend wholeheartedly that you choose the $20/day (plus tips) valet over $13 self-parking. The housekeepers were unobtrusively efficient in both daily cleaning and nightly turndown. On Christmas day, Rosa fashioned a few towels into a lovely basket of flowers. Regrettably our plans took us away from the hotel for most meals, except one lunch at the poolside restaurant Beech, a light dinner from room service, and most breakfasts at the Harvest Bistro. The breakfast buffet exceeds expectations in this family-oriented market where hotels can easily get away with less. In particular, the omelet station works much faster than I am used to seeing at either standalone restaurants or hotels like Embassy Suites. During busy holiday periods like Christmas week, get down to the Bistro before 8:30 to avoid waits of 45 minutes or more for a table. Because I have free theme park parking with my WDW annual pass, I used the theme park bus service only once, to go to Animal Kingdom. The bus makes two pickups, one at the Hilton and one at the Waldor, then goes to Magic Kingdom, and finally to AK. A second bus line goes to Hollywood Studios, Epcot, and Downtown Disney. Since DD is only about 5 miles away, I recommend a taxi instead of the 45-minute bus ride. The buses are luxury coaches with reclining seats. Other reviewers have made clear the very high level of HOBC's facilities. I would just point out that the lazy river is unmatched by any Disney hotel pool, including Stormalong Bay. The holiday decorations, while perhaps not Disney-quality, were certainly superior by any other standard. Our seven nights at HOBC flew by and my family is looking forward to our next visit.

This was our 3rd stay and yet again, we were not disappointed. As a testament to the hotels superior service...during our latest stay in December, I checked out and was at the airport when I realized that I left my jewelry in the room safe. I called the hotel and told them my flight left in 30 mins and would they please check the safe and let me know if they recovered the jewelry, so that I wouldn't be sick to my stomach the whole flight home. Within 20 minutes, they called to tell me they had my jewelry and were sending it right out. I received it less than 24 hours later! ALL of it!! And...they told me to consider the fedex charges my Christmas present!!! This is something you would expect from a Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton...but the Hilton Bonnet Creek is definitely on the same level in my opinion. The pool for my 6 and 8 year old boys was awesome...music perfect, layout perfect, lazy river awesome.

We were made to feel extremely welcome the entire time we were there (special thanks to Brenda in the Harvest Bistro, who took the time to show us around the buffet on our first morning), and as I was celebrating my birthday during our stay we were given a complimentary dessert in La Luce on our first night, and a massive slice of chocolate fudge cake on my birthday itself! The concierge also made sure that the restaurant in the hotel next door, where we ate on my birthday, was aware of the date and we were given seats by the window with views of the Epcot fireworks, together with another complimentary dessert! Our room was spacious with two large and very comfortable beds, and we had a view out over the pool and over towards one of the Disney hotels. The soundproofing was excellent - we didn't hear anything from the nearby lifts, other guests or anyone in the corridor. As we were with Virgin, we also had the use of the concierge lounge, together with free Internet, up on the 16th floor, which was extremely handy. The pool is lovely, although if you're wanting to do some serious swimming it would be better to head to the Waldorf next door (guests of either hotel can use the facilities at both), as the pool at the Hilton is very shallow and dominated by the lazy river. There is also a water slide and two hot tubs, which were the perfect way to relax after a busy day at the Disney parks! They do \"dive in movies\" each night as well - an inflatable cinema screen pops up and popular movies are aired for people to watch whilst sitting around the pool. The hotel runs free shuttles to the Disney parks - the timetable seems to change from week to week so ask at reception for the most up to date one. They also run town cars to Downtown Disney, which were very reasonable. As we also wanted to go to Universal, Sea World and Discovery Cove, we booked shuttle passes through Virgin with Mears - the times aren't wonderfully flexible but at a $19 per person return journey, you save a lot on taxis! The hotel has two main restaurants - the Harvest Bistro, where we had breakfast each morning, and La Luce. There is also a pool bar, where we had lunch one day. All of the restaurants were excellent, as was the Bull and Bear at the Waldorf, but I found the choices at La Luce a tad restricted, and the wine at the Bull and Bear was VERY expensive! I can highly recommend the omelettes for breakfast and also the quattro formaggi pizza in La Luce (although not if you're a vegetarian as it's topped with ham!). The only note of caution I would sound is that if you're waiting to use the poolside restrooms (which are incredibly clean), beware of the bitey ants.

We stayed last year right after it opened. I can confidently say that the hotel was just as great this time as the last. This visit we stayed from the Wed before Christmas until Christmas Eve day. Check in was a breeze, it took less than five minutes. We asked for a room overlooking the pool and were given just that. We even were allowed to check in at 11 am. We booked the amazing Florida resident rate of $111/ night, which included free breakfast every day. The room was immaculately clean and the beds were very comfortable. The only complaint is that the air conditioner could have cooled the room a little faster. After dropping our bags off we took the shuttle bus that takes you to all the parks on Disney property. The bus is a full sized coach and the driver furnished us with all the necessary information about when pick up was and also what time each park closed. One morning we ordered room service which arrived very quickly and was followed up by a phone call from in room dining inquiring if the meal was to our liking. The other mornings we ate at the buffet in the Harvest restaurant. We never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table. The breakfast buffet was very good including fresh baked pastries, bagels, lox, made to order omelets, cereals both hot and cold, fresh fruit and many other items. On our last evening we returned from Epcot to find that our room had not been cleaned. I called the front desk, not to complain, but to simply let them be aware that our room was missed. They apologized. The next morning I received a phone call from housekeeping who apologized again, and was offered compensation that more than made up for the oversight. I was so pleasantly surprised by this. We checked out on Christmas Eve day, gave our bags to the bellman, and spent most of the afternoon by the wonderful resort pool before driving home. The pool area is large but not massive. It includes a zero entry area for kids, and also a lovely lazy river. My son loved that this year he was tall enough to do the water slide.

Over Thanksgiving week my family (wife & son, age 9) stayed at the Bonnet Creek Hilton. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, our stay was nothing short of excellent. From the check-in, valet, cleaning crew, etc. everyone made us feel at home, were attentive and very courteous. The food was excellent, service impeccable and all amenities were of the highest standards. While everyone should be noted for their excellence, one person in particular deserves mention. Ashley, at the Harvest Bistro, went above and beyond to help our situation. First their was confusion about our Thanksgiving dinner reservation. Without hesitation she made sure that their was seating for us. Then, as my son usually does, made friends with another couple's children. They had not made reservation for Thanksgiving and again, without hesitation, Ashley made sure they would be included at our table. At no time did she consider no an option and made sure that every detail was attended to, She is without a doubt, someone is destined to higher capabilities within your organization. The only low point was the Beach Cafe, and this issue has been addressed with the GM through an email he initiated to me. Again, a good example of following up on a customer's comment and trying to remedy a potential problem. My wife and I run our own small business, and are very conscious of giving our customers high quality, value for their dollar and the upmost customer service. So, it is not uncommon for us to expect the same high standards we give our customers when we are customers ourselves. We are happy to report that your hotel far exceeded those expectations and we have already told many of our friends & customers (several who are headed your way this winter) of our experience at your hotel.

While the property is on \"Disney\" land I don't know for sure that they are serviced by Disney Busses. I believe the Hotel has Shuttle service. This is a swanky place, so I can't imagine them not offering this service. We drove, ate and parked at Contemporary Hotel - took us about 10 minutes door to door. Now the lobby is very nice, huge ceilings, several lounges to chose from and a friendly staff awaited us. We had the kids with us, so we were a party of four. We we arrived we found out they upgraded us to a high level room with DIsney Park View. I was already pleased with the visit at this point. The front desk person explained the property and showed us which way to go ( you do have to pay attention...the high level rooms have seperate elevators - not a huge deal, just good to be aware of). We got to our room and I was quite impressed. We stay at a LOT of resorts and this one really gets super points from me on being a \"standard\" room. The size of the rooms rival the contemporary's very sizable rooms. The bedding, furniture and such were very tasteful and modern. The HUGE windows floor to ceiling lent a great view of Disney Studios and even some of the Caribbean Beach resort. I think the high level rooms get you a much better view of the properties. The bathroom was nice for as expected for a 4* hotel. Granite counters, powerful shower heads and plenty of room. My wife also noted the had a very good hair dryer too... We were only there overnight, so we didn't get to enjoy the pool we did get a fantastic view. It has a big lazy river, bars, several pools, lots of hot tubs. Nicely laid out, quality outdoor equipment like loungers, chairs & umbrellas looked really tempting. Now let's talk about my FAVORITE thing is this hotel is AMAZING for families. Recreation has events every hour for the kids outside and inside. The hotels are totally set up for families. There are other families there and you don't feel like you want to shove a sock in your kids mouth when they jibber jabber too loud. Others are dealing with the same thing, so it's no big deal. Let me also note that it's not super loud - especially the breakfast buffet (which was awesome & kids eat free). Instant gratification for kids via the bountiful breakfast buffet keeps the kids eating the sound reasonable for the amount of families dinning there. Overall, I gotta tell you....This is really probably going to become one of my favorite disney property hotels. It will take a longer visit to 2-3 night minimums to really get a feel for it. The bottom line is the staff was great, the rooms were spectacular ad the property is down right amazing.

During my 2nd visit to the restaurant, because of a small misunderstanding at the beginning, I was moved from the main dining room to the bar, which wasn't really a big deal for me. But after the restaurant manager found out about the situation, he was being very apologetic and gave me complimentary martini and apetizer. I really appreciate that they are making the effort to ensure that we have the best experience. I also had ice cream couple of times at Muse and it was amazing! The only disadvantage I can think of is that you probably need a car for your stay here. The hotel only provides shuttles to the theme park.

First of all 50.00 will buy you two eggs in the bistro and secondly I did not spend 4-5 thousand on airfare, Disney tickets, hotel, etc to get put in an already occupied room at 1:00 am . 2011 again arrived late in the evening early morning. I had paid in advance for a Disney view, 2 queen beds with breakfast. (More appropriate to call it pool-golf course view, Disney is a speck from the hotel rooms). Asked the front desk about the Disney view and he said see if you like the view and if you don\u2019t I will give you another room. Get up to the room and I see Wyndham\u2019s parking lot, where is the Disney view. Sent the bell man downstairs with the bug that was crawling around with the print out from Hilton showing room type of Disney view. Front desk guy with missing buttons, just thread hanging where the buttons should be on his suit (Hilton, if he has to buy his own suit give him a raise, if this is hotel owned suit get a button put on for this poor guy) kept apologizing but refused to give me a room with Disney view. Night manager now starts to fumble around and says they will give me 100.00 credit. I don\u2019t want the credit I want the view I paid for. They only had a 1 bed deluxe they could give me. Next day I am given a Disney view room that is on the other end from the elevators, it is pretty far to walk after spending a day at Disney. The designers of this hotel must be college drop outs to not realize that you put the elevators in the middle of the hotel not on one end of it. There was also a Ginger bread house decoration going on in the lobby while were there. They were promising the kids that there decorations will be put on the house that was built in the lobby. Next day the kids run to find there decorations and they are not there. The person standing by the front door to greet new check ins was clue less and said she had been on vacation for last 5 days and knew nothing about the decorations. Housekeeping kept knocking on our door everyday with last warning to let them clean or they have to go to a different floor and will not be able to make the room for the day. The bistro is crowded for breakfast on busy days, again not designed to handle 1000 room hotel but more like 100. Pool is very nice except be prepared to pay for floaters etc. Bottom line the staff is trained to be polite and quickly apologize for everything in a very animated scripted fashion; they lack common sense to resolve simple issues. The front desk is filled with people 9-10 at a time but all of them are clueless other than to give out scripted answers and offer apologies.

The only issue we had with them was that there schedule was a little confusing. It list the departure times for all of the parks but if you go simlply by that and don't look at the other chart on the bottom for final pick up times you might get stranded like we did after Mickeys party at midnight on Friday. Apparently the shuttle doesn't pickup at the scheduled departure time every night, only after regular business hours. If regular business hours are until 7 like the Friday we went and you stay for a special party such as Christmas or Halloween, you would have to arrange your own transportation. Luckily a shuttle coordinator stopped by on his way home and saw us sitting there alone and asked us where we were going. He took us back to the hotel. We gave him a nice tip. Crisis averted.

There's a big difference betwen staying in a real hotel (i.e. Hilton Orlando Bonnet Creek) and a Disney property like Port Orleans or Caribbean Beach, where the check-in lines are long, the distance from check-in to your unit could be a 20-minute hike through winding and poorly marked sidewalks, and where the dining options are limited and sometimes totally booked for the evening. This Hilton is new, well-designed, efficient and basically a pleasure to stay in. Unfortunately, it was cold and cloudy the few days I was there, so nobody was outside, but the whole pool area looked wonderful. The room itself was modern and upscale. The Hilton is right next to the Waldorf Astoria. The two hotels share a conference center, parking lot, and a golf course. My only quibble is that the Web indicates a variety of dining options, but if you're looking for a nice dinner, there's really only one viable option at each hotel. The Hilton has La Luce, which is an excellent Italian restaurant, but it's a relatively small place. For example, the bar looks like it has about 8 seats. So, with a captive audience of hotel guests tired from a long day at the Disney parks or at a business conference, it's always extremely crowded and one night I was told there was a 90-minute wait for a table. So, I trucked up to the Waldorf, where the situation was exactly the same. One decent restaurant, Bull and Bear. Long wait. I was able to grab a table in the bar area, where the menu was limited. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the Bull and Bear. It looks like one of those stuffy old-school, steak-and-mashed-potatoes places. But my meal was wonderful and inventive -- I think I ordered fillet of bass (the waitress called it rock fish) but it was a delicious cube of fish with sea foam on top. For dessert I ordered an apple torte -- which turned out to be an interesting combination of warm and cold -- a flat, pancake-shaped pastry with a cold scoop of apple filling on top. It was all nicely done, the waitress was fast and efficient and the whole place had a modern, friendly vibe, despite the very traditional decor. Anyway, back to the Hilton.

The hotel is joined with the waldorf by a large conference centre which host numerous conventions. Our only gripe was that on one of the nights there was some form of hairdressers convention on and the room next door was incredibly noisy into the early hours. Reception were contacted and to their credit the guests were spoken to within minutes. We had a round of golf at the waldorf course. This was a lovely, well manicured resort course. However, being a regular golfer in Orlando there are certainly cheaper courses with more character around. However, it is convenient and the facilities top drawer. The hotel is situated in a great location. Five minutes to Disney parks (it's actually within the Disney area) 15 mins to international drive and literally 2 mins to downtown Disney. Overall I cannot speak to highly of this hotel. Everything was great and we had a great holiday. Would we return? Too right we would and I would highly recommend it to anyone", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel - Great for Couples or Families\u201d", "Author": "Jazzy310", "ReviewID": "UR120464487", "Content": "The hotel is beautiful and has alot to offer for couples or families.

The pool at the Hilton is wonderful but didn't like the fact that you had to pay for a float each day. Have stayed at other properties that have a lazy river & never have paid to use a tube. It seems like many of the guest don't want to pay for them so remember your float number because you might have to chase down your float after someone takes it. Happened to us twice in one day & to many other guest we spoke to as well. I selected this hotel because it was close to Disney & they offer transportation to all the parks. The bus ride to Disney isn't bad but if you have young kids be prepared to sit on the bus 30 to 40 mins for the other parks. They do offer a Disney movie on the ride which is entertaining for all. The breakfast in Harvest was very good. They offer anything & everything you could want in a breakfast buffet. The only downfall was the dirty glassware. We have breakfast there 3 mornings & every morning the juice glass was dirty & you could see mouth prints on the rim of the glass. When we called attention to this the restaurant manager came to our table promptly and offered his apologies & compted our breakfast which was very nice! The beds were quite firm, maybe a little to firm for my liking. I wanted a foam pillow & it took 2 calls and close to an hour to bring one to the room.

You can read my first vist to see it was my favorite hotel in this area. I extended almost every business trip to the area to stay a day or two here. No longer. I called for 3 a night stay and they only had 2 of the 3 nights available. No problem, I found a GREAT rate at the new hotel accross the street. WOW, you have options now when you stay in this area. When I moved over to the Hilton I experenced a night and day difference between the two hotels. At the other hotel I was greeted by a hugh smile and respect. They do not allow for hire cars in the welcoming area, they are parked down the street, out of the view of arriving guest. My car was not moved during check in. I arrived at the Hilton knowing the entire check in area would be cluttered with for hire cars. They cater to them instead of the arriving guest. I was verbally threated by the valet. I travel with business equipment in my car, so I do not valet my car. I arrived 30 minutes before normal check-in and wanted to make sure I could check in early before I unloaded my car. Not an option my car was moved within 30 seconds with my business equipment in it. It was 2pm, I was the only person checking in. After having such a positive morning at the other hotel, it made this arrival that much worse. They lazy river is hard to beat however I can get use to the multiple pools and a lagoon across the street and better eating options. I don't know that I will be back, with the new Hilton opening, by the convention center, with a lazy river and the new hotel (other brand) across the street. This hotel is starting to show the wear and tear. My shower had mold and the ref either doesn't cool at all or freezes everything. This happened on my last visit as well.

Our view of the hotel's pool area and golf course was great, as far as Disney . . . well not so much. We could see the tops of the buildings at Hollywood Studios (not a great firework view as I was hoping) and a bit of the Epcot fireworks if we craned our necks around to the right. So really in terms of seeing anything Disney, not so much. We still enjoyed the view we did have. Our room was very clean and well maintained. We inadvertently left the do not disturb sign on the door one day and housekeeping did not disturb our empty room. The bathroom was very well appointed and decorated. I also appreciated the many accessible outlets located throughout the room. The staff was courteous and helpful. The woman at the front desk who checked us in was great. The bellman was very courteous and provided my husband with ample brochures and information on the area parks as we arrived. The conceriege was helpful as well. We ate at the Harvest Bistro for breakfast most days. They have a breakfast buffet which makes it easy for an on the go family. Kids 12 and under eat free for breakfast and dinner as well, so that was a pleasant surprise. The food was very good, not exceptional, but good and consistent. My one complaint was that they do not have gluten-free cereal. In terms of transport to the parks, there is a courtesy shuttle from the hotel to each of the Disney parks. It was a nice charter type bus which is much more comfortable than the basic Disney transport buses so they were very, very nice. The schedule to the Magic Kingdom was great with buses running every 1/2 hour to the Ticket & Transportation Center, while buses to the other parks ran mostly every hour. The one down side is you do need a little extra travel time because you go to a few parks for both pick-up and drop-off. It's not enough to be a big deal.

We chose this Hilton because it was new, big, had a cool looking pool and I've never been disappointed with the brand (until this trip). I'll list the pros and cons: The good: Pool is awesome. A lazy river takes you around the pool in a tube (you have to pay $$ to rent the tubes, however..) There's a slide for kids, and my daughter loved it. The pool is heated, and that's a big plus to me as many hotel pools feel like ice baths, especially in late October as the Florida nights start to cool a little. The two hot tubs were also a plus. There are two unique little fire pits by the pool, where for substantial $$ you can get marshmallows to roast over the pit. The hotel is new and very clean. This would be a good place for a business conference. The parking garage attached to the hotel is neat too, but again you have to pay $$ to park there. The mediocre: The rooms are new and clean, but nothing special. A 30 year old Days Inn probably has the same room layout. Though the counter was big in the bathroom, there was only one sink. The low water pressure in the shower was horrible. There are no balconies, which in my opinion is a shame in any Florida hotel.. The horrible: Plan on eating elsewhere. The $$ they charge for the very mediocre fare is outrageous. For breakfast I went to the little grab and go store in the lobby area (as we didn't want to pay a mint for the breakfast in the restaurant). The cinnamon rolls were extremely greasy and doughy. The bagels hadn't arrived yet, as they were late that day (!!), so not much choice unless you wanted an artery bomb chocolate pastry or something similar. Nothing healthy, I don't think there were any bannanas, either. Very limited choice for dinner as well. The small cafe by the pool was high-priced for low level food. That goes for the other one or two formal dining options they had. My advice: Downtown Disney is very close-by. Go there for all your lunch and dinner options. Superb food at Wolfgang Puck express- and reasonable. Great atmosphere for kids and great food at the Rainforest Cafe- or T-Rex. Downtown Disney is the place for eating and shopping in the immediate area, no contest. In conclusion, the hotel is new and clean with a great pool. Those are the only good points in my opinion if you're going on a non-business trip with family. If you want to stay at a Hilton in the area, stay at the \"Hilton Orlando Lake Buena Vista\" instead. It's literally right across the street from Downtown Disney, you can walk there no problem- even with strollers, etc.. can't be beat for an Orlando Hilton. I would not return to the Hilton Bonnet Creek unless on a business trip and had no choice.

We decided to stay at the Hilton Orlando because the rates were less expensive than the on-site Disney hotels, the hotel was pretty new, and it was located right next to the Waldorf-Astoria and we could use the spa there. I thought that the lazy river pool downstairs was a nice touch, you don't have to go to the water parks to experience that. The spa at the Waldorf Astoria was also very good, top notch quality service. Unfortunately, the bell hops weren't very focused on their jobs (they did more chit-chatting). When I checked in all by myself (husband arrived on the next day) and had 2 very big suitcases, although the bell hops helped me get my suitcases out of the car none of them offered to help carry them. I had even planned on giving them a big tip! I had to carry my suitcases to a far away part of my floor. Luckily one of the housekeeping staff helped me with my suitcases when she saw how much stuff I had. On my second day there, they were testing the fire alarm but when I returned to the hotel at 5pm the fire alarm was still ringing and they asked us all to go downstairs to the lobby.

As a Hilton Hhonors Gold member the breakfast buffet (called a continental breakfast on the coupon) was a freebie for all four of us in the room - and it is a good one - valued by the hotel at $25 a person - custom omelettes (spinach was a highlight), custom pancakes (marshmallows, chocolate chip, sprinkles, fruit toppings), very fresh fruit (pineapple, strawberries, honeydew, cantaloupe), lots of bakery items, hot plates of taters / eggs / sausage / bacon, and orange juice / coffee / tea included, and surprises (salmon/lox with capers and onions available) - the wait staff at the buffet were attentive and friendly. Google maps worked to get us to the hotel - Sprint GPS did not. The bus / shuttle schedule to disney is available online at www.bonnetshuttle.com - be aware that in the morning, the bus goes first to Magic Kingdom (20 minutes later), then EPCOT, and last Hollywood Studios (arrives 40 minutes after leaving) - so if you want to get to Hollywood Studios first thing, drive there yourself or take a cab - we were frustrated since we wanted to get to Hollywood at opening and the bus driver did not give us that key info (just said \"yes we go to Hollywood\"). The pool is one of the best we have been at, including all of the Disney hotels - the lazy river moves nicely and is 3.5 feet to 4 feet deep throughout and goes under a few bridges that each have water spouts hitting you - the water slide was better than any of the Disney ones we have been at including better than Beach Club and Boardwalk, although the day we were there it was cold until about 1pm - a zero entry middle area was great for little kids (and grandmothers) and is both non-moving water and gives easy access to the lazy river. Tons of lay out in the sun chaises (the nice ones with sunbrella fabric) and a little store rents tubes and sells toys / sunblock / etc. The bar folks were fantastic for my daughter - she had a grilled cheese (which came in a nice paper box) - and when she wanted a refill they were both very friendly and gave her a plastic pumpkin glass with straw (which is now getting used at home). The adult frozen drinks were yummy and plentiful, and they have a very large choice of special rums (I did not partake, but recognized many of them). The very huge and tall ceiling lobby was decorated in Halloween theme with pumpkins, and all was very clean (saw people cleaning discreetly every time I was downstairs). Covered parking is next door for a fee, and I would not recommend valet since it is maybe 1000 feet from your car to the lobby. Exercise room was large and updated with nice equipment - and was being used about 20% each day.

This is not guaranteed with a Disney view as it will depend on what part of the building you are in. We did overlook disney and it was amazing (just couldn;t see the fireworks). We overlooked the beautiful pool area and ponds and golf courses and it is well worth it for the view. Our little one watched the pool like a hawk to see what was going on! The rooms are very good sized but not huge, as is the bathroom not huge, but everything is brand new and completely spotless. This is the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in and I stay in a lot of hotels. Amazing job by housekeeping and we hardly saw them. The pool area is the main attraction. It is so great. The lazy river is warm and keeps the kids occupied all day. My husband and I would take turns floating with our son and this was well deserved after a long day at the parks (we just stayed at the pool our last day, as everyone was tired and this is what our son wanted to do the most!) At the waterslide (which is fun for kids and adults), there are two staff members supervising, so we were able to let our son go down the slide without worrying about watching him. This pool is spectacular and should not be missed. The resort is beautiful and we walked over to the WA but didn't spend time over there. It looks very upscale. The dining is a mixture. Harvest Bistro for breakfast was pretty good. La Luce was absolutely fabulous. One of the best Italian meals I have had. Fantastic! Muse is a coffeeshop (think Starbucks) and was great for breakfast. They have bagels, muffins, pastry and donuts (plus icecream and dessert) We would grab a bagel before heading to the parks as to not waste time. Big plus! Took the shuttle once to the parks and it worked great. We travelled with family that had a car so we only used the shuttle once. I would recommend a car for at least some of the days of a trip. Just to run to the store and buy water and snacks and a change in the dinner availability. This is a great place and we will be back next year! One other tip: I booked the room 4 months in advance and then checked back online with Hilton and the price dropped twice. I called Hilton each time and they lowered our rate each time.

We were able to check in on line before we set off for the airport and printed our boarding passes. I was also able to check the UK football results and reports. The quality of food and drink was good but as in all Hilton Hotels, a bit on the expensive side. It is easy enough to have a take away brought in to the hotel if you want to eat cheaply and not go out. The hotel staff has menus from different food outlets that they will give you to choose from. A plus side of eating in the hotel when you have young children is that they have kids eat free. This is good value if you have a young family with you Parking is in a multi storey car park costing 13$ per day self park and 20$ per day valet park. We used the self-park and only had problems at the weekend with the number of cars for the conventions. The car park is about 500 yards from the hotel entrance Hotel Location. We thought that the location was ideal. Downtown Disney and most of the theme parks are only a short drive away with a free shuttle bus for Downtown Disney and some of the theme parks. The pick up point was near the Hilton multi story car park, it then picks up at the nearby Waldorf Hotel.

The volume was just bearable in the week but at the weekend there was a DJ playing, what was to me awful music at such a volume that I managed until 3 pm on the Sunday, I then had to go to the room with a headache. You may say why not go to a quieter area around the pool but all week the piped music is from speakers positioned all around the pool. At the weekend, even though it is a large pool, the DJ positioned himself in the middle of the pool area so no escape from the noise was possible. Summary. Very good comfortable hotel, well positioned with good staff, good swimming pool but please cut down the music volume. Would we stay here again?

The bathroom was ample (only one sink, but plenty of counter space). Good shower pressure and the towels are very soft and plush. They give you robes which usually only resorts and 5-star luxury hotels provide, a very nice amenity considering the price. The service was wonderful and the Harvest Bistro had a delicious breakfast. I usually do not do buffets, but this one was clean, well supervised and wonderfully stocked; well worth the price.

The foyer - that houses the reception, concierge & a bar area is huge! But then, when you think they have numerous conference facilities it can fill up and get rather noisy as there is nothing to absorb the noise. The lifts (elevators) are excellent and the corridors are kept nice and clean/clear. On arrival at reception they had us all booked in the same room, but this was rectified straight away without problem. There is no assistance given or offered with luggage, so you have to manage this yourself. On to our room. As we were part of a package deal with Virgin we were not given a choice of room/view. After reading some of the reports on Trip Advisor I can only assume that there are rooms larger than ours was. Having said that, it was more than adequate for our stay. Not a lot of wardrobe space, but plenty of drawer space. The fridge and safe are a bonus. We were on the 16th floor so did have a good view of the countryside, but not of the pool or Disney. Downside was that we were near the Grande Vista Room and that was used a few evenings during our stay as a 'hospitality' room. This made it very noisy, especially when people drifted out onto the floor area by the lifts to chat! We spent the whole holiday dreading the next event. I will say we did not complain to management as it did not start until after the weekend that we arrived (we got there on a Thursday) and so we had unpacked all our luggage and it would have meant repacking etc if they moved us.....we were just hoping it did not happen every night. The Virgin Room is also on this floor and my son was near that, but did not have any problems (This room is excellent for Virgin guests). The tea/coffee/milk provided is very frugal, so we asked for extra every day and this was provided by our housekeeper. Also you are only supplied with 2 polystyrene cups - but about 4 lids?!?! Once again we asked for extra cups. We don't watch television much on holiday, but do like to keep up with the news. However the picture kept pixulating and freezing, so we didn't get to see much at all. The bathroom is quite small, but with ample towels which is excellent. It is the first hotel we've stayed in that doesn't supply shower gel. There are 2 different soaps, shampoo, conditioner and mouthwash, but no gel. The soap (and anything else that has been used, albeit even once) is renewed every day! Methinks I would prefer one bar of soap for the sink and some shower gel for use in the shower. The bed is very, very comfy and so are the pillows. But as comfy as it was, I can't agree that it is the best bed I've ever slept in. Included in our holiday was breakfast (at $19 per person per day it was good to have this included in our holiday), this is served in the Harvest Bistro. They do a brill job of seating people and waiting on them. Everyone was efficient, from the cheerful people that met you at the door and seated you, to the waiting staff. Greg in particular was a delight. The food at breakfast was good, and so was the selection. We only had one evening meal there as there is not a lot of choice. It would have been nice if they did a weekly menu so you had a different choice the 2nd week, but it stays the same. We didn't eat at La Luce. We hired a car and included in our package was parking - and at $13 a day this too was a bargain for us. We never had any problems self parking. The lazy river is a wonderful asset for the hotel, we really enjoyed it. Towels are supplied in the pool area and they come round with frozen grapes! Although we didn't use the rings I would suggest that the grapes are kicked into touch in favour of a 'no charge' for the rings, as $5 per time this must work out expensive for families. I have to add that I do think that the hire charge for these and the cost of parking should both be absorbed into the cost of the holiday and not an extra. The hotel is rather out of the way, and although there is a complimentary shuttle bus to all the Disney attractions it is still on a timetable so you have to work around it, so it is best to hire a car. Maybe what they charge for parking covers the cost of the shuttle? If you want a choice of place to eat then you definitely need transport. All in all, the hotel is very nice and very good. We weren't there when there were many families as it was after school holidays, but I think from what I've seen that this is definitely more geared to conferences and the guests that attend them, rather than people like us who were there for 2 weeks and families. The standard is certainly no better or worse than I would expect from a hotel from the Hilton range or a 4/5* star hotel. Yes the service is good (although one of the guys at the concierge desk was quite 'terse' with us), yes the rooms are clean and well attended, yes the public area's are clean and tidy and the maintenance of the hotel is good. Yes the lazy river is brilliant. It is expensive (but it is a Hilton hotel so it really is to be expected, so do not be surprised) but no more so than lots of other hotels of the same calibre, somewhat noisy at times, very noisy at others in the main areas and, as stated, on floor 16. Every hotel has noisy areas, but you couldn't get away from the noise for a quiet drink when conference people were staying in the hotel. First and foremost it IS a conference hotel. Having said all this I would certainly recommend the hotel, and if you've read this and have seen what I consider to be the good and (not so) bad aspects, then you will know what to expect. You may agree with some and disagree with other points, but at least you will have an idea. And yes, I would definitely go back there - with a car again and on a different floor.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando,", "Title": "\u201cDisney wine and dine stay\u201d", "Author": "bpepp22", "ReviewID": "UR119034397", "Content": "Stayed here last weekend dor the Disney Wine and Dine Half Marathon.

My family and I often visit Florida and stay in Disney Deluxe Resorts and this hotel beats them all! After a flight delay and very long 10 hour journey the staff at the hotel were very helpful showed us to our suite which was HUGE! We chose to have a suite rather than just one room as the Disney hotel rooms have often been a little bit too small for comfort in the past however the rooms in the Hilton are much bigger and there really wasn't much need for the extra room. My family had notified the hotel staff that I had recently graduated from university and I found throughout the two weeks random staff congratulating me which was a lovely touch. Wine and a cheese platter was also sent to my room as a gift from the staff. The restaurant staff are all very helpful and the food was delicious in all three places, all waiters and waitresses go out of their way to make sure you are enjoying your food and are more than happy to help with absolutely anything from food related queries to what are the best new shows in Magic Kingdom. The free Disney shuttle bus service is brilliant the coach is huge with comfortable seats and very punctual. In the mornings they often play a film on the coach to keep you entertained whilst on your journey, we saw Rio, Toy Story 3 and Robots. The pool area can get busy at weekends as many families come with their children as a weekend break however there were always sun loungers available and friendly staff bringing round frozen grapes. The lazy river is great especially when you are in the sun for long periods of time. There are also pool movies every Friday and Saturday night. Overall I could not fault this hotel the staff cannot do more for you and are so friendly. If you want a vacation in Florida and want a more 'grown up' hotel this is the place!

Actual check was as fast and pleasant as the check in. Be aware however that even though the hotel has several bars and restaurants, you will find in themthe typical convention crowd, besides familes with children, and if you wish to wonder out, you are a bit far from any mall or strip. Your only option will be a taxi (no public transportation available, this is not NY or Boston, or Chicago). The pool is great and the lazy river is quite long. There is a nice bar at one of the ends of the pool, and at the other end, there is a screen for film showing. It is like a drive in, but pool like (pool-in ? Swim-in?). They show disney films for children, which I find marvelous. And clever. The only downside of the pool is that there is not a single area deeper than 5 feet. You can literally walk/stand everywhere, so if you really want a pool where you can swim laps, this is not it. Choice of food is O.K., with an upscale Italian restaurant (did not get to try it), and a more middle of the road one at the pool level (I ordered a special burger which was nothing memorable, but again, I just needed to eat something and I was by myself). Another thing you absolutely need to be aware of is the surcharges you will be slammed with if you order breakfast to eat in your room. I was so astonished and knew my friends would not believe it that I took a picture of the proposed breakfast menu. The food itself is nothing out of the ordinary, and the pricing is in accordance to what you can expect in a Hilton.

This fee is not a gratuity and is the property of the hotel to cover discretionary costs. An additional $3 in room dining charge, plus any tax, will be added to your account\".

The free shuttle bus service ended early in the evening and I had to take a taxi back.

Complimentary chocolates at night, 2 free breakfast certificates each day and kids eat free. They also gave us vouchers for free ice cream for the kids each day. The property is beautiful and the breakfast buffett was awesome. The Harvest Bistro is where the kids eat free but you have to buy at least one entree to get this. I got a burger for $13.00, which was the cheapest item on the menu. It was good but not $13.00 good. They had an Italian buffet on Friday night which was excellent and worth the money. Self parking is $10.00 per day and you should consider buying a float at walmart instead of renting one from the hotel for $5.00 per day. If you like mountain dew, I suggest you bring it with you. Disney has a contract with coke and you can't find Pepsi products within 5 miles of this place. Of all the Hiltons we have stayed in around Florida, this one tops the list by far.

Living in Florida for more than 25 years, we have spent many vacations in the Orlando area at various hotels. Our last trip was at the Hilton Orlando Bonnet Creek. This hotel, or should I say resort, is a gem located in the perfect location right near Disney World and Downtown Disney. Everything at the Hilton Orlando Bonnet Creek far exceeded all of our expectations. We stayed 3 nights for a get-a-way from South Florida and to re-visit some of the parks. Check-in went flawlessly, Lauren met us at the front desk with a smile and the most pleasant attitude, we could tell she enjoyed her job and right away we felt at home. While checking in, Kevin, one of the hotel managers, came out and introduced himself and made sure that we were being taken care of. We were very impressed with the attention to detail, the d\u00e9cor and the cleanliness of the lobby. You could tell that the employees took pride in the pace as well as in their own appearance. Upon arriving to the room we were surprised at how spacious it was, it had a refrigerator and other amenities useful for families. The room was clean, well kept and spotless! We looked out the window at a wonderful view of Disney World. But the best view seen from the window was the Lazy River and pool slide below. That evening we went to a show at Downtown Disney, which is very close to the hotel and no traffic. Came back to a quiet hotel and fell asleep in the lush bed with many choices of pillows. The next morning, we went downstairs to have a quick breakfast before going to the park. We were greeted at our table by Greg to ask if we would like to order from the menu or have the buffet. The logical choice was the buffet due to the enormity of food on it. The highlight of the breakfast was the fresh egg omelet made to order by the cook and the bread pudding. This buffet had so much, from pancakes, waffles, eggs, bacon, different breads, donuts, it would be hard not to find more items to try than you have room for in your stomach. Greg went well beyond what was expected to make out breakfast experience pleasurable. We spent more time at the buffet trying new food items than we had planned and got a late start to the park. While at the park, we really thought that the Lazy River at the resort would feel much better than the heat radiating from the walkways and people in line. So we left after a couple of hours and went back to enjoy the resort. Back the resort we went to Beeches, the bar located next to the Lazy River, Brittany help us with the drinks and Daniel came by to greet us and make sure everything was going well. The drinks at Beeches were wonderful and the atmosphere was great. We spent the rest of the time at the hotel with a couple of shopping trips to the close by outlet mall. One of the nicer things about this resort is that it is connected to the Waldorf Astoria. So when we felt like we needed an escape to a more adult location, we just walked to the Waldorf pools and stay there for a while. The Hotel has so many restaurants to choose from and you also have access to those in the Waldorf Astoria along with the spa. We spent our last night at the Sena Bar, located in the lobby of the Hilton where Cassy took very good care of us.

Now for the down side....the free transportation to the Disney Parks can't compare to the Disney Hotels.

We chose the hotel based on the positive reviews on trip advisor. I am from Europe, currently live in NY, and have travelled extensively. Over the years I have stayed in many reputable hotels around the world. Let's start with the positive. As described by many, the hotel is fairly new and in very good shape. As one reviewer posted, the building itself looks like a hospital, but inside the decor is quite warm with attention to detail. The rooms are very clean and beds comfortable. The outdoor area of the hotel, including the lazy river and golf courts, are well-maintained. The average: FOOD. Anyone who has high standards in this department will be dissapointed. The Harves Bistro has an average breakfust buffet and equally average lunch and dinner menu. We tried almost everything on the menu, including dishes that came highly recommended by the servers, and were not impressed. The Italian restaurant, La Luce, is generally regarded by staff and visitors as the better restaurant. The most positive comment I can give it, is that their pizza is very good. We were not impressed with any of the other meals we had there. My husband usually orders meat and I tend to prefer salads and seafood so we usually get a variety from the menu. We tried Oscar's for brunch one morning. There were a few items of higher quality at this buffet than the Harvest Bistro, but certainly not worth it for what they charge. The Beech cafe (outdoor pool restaurant) offers your typical unhealthy child menu. Our children did not love any of the choices and they tried them all (chicken fingers, cheese hamburger, grilled cheese sandwich, peanut butter and jelly sandwich). The chopped chicken salad and turkey wrap are the only decent choices on the regular menu. The nachos are a blend of soggy chips and toppings. Everything is very overpriced considering the quality. Since this hotel was built on a nature preserve, it is a bit of an undertaking to leave the hotel and seek out other restaurants in Orlando. Thankfully, we had a rental car during our stay, which allowed us to dine at two excellent restaurants off the hotel property. Next category is service which was mixed. Almost every server at Harvest Bistro was very gracious, friendly, and tried their best. Brenda and Rocky stood out. The manager (forgot his name) is a charming, charismatic, and very professional man. Housekeeping was great. Service outside: worst in the hotel. This is where a supervisor or manager is needed most, but was not visible. Most servers appear very young. None are to be found when they are needed. When guests give up and decide to get their own food and drinks, the servers are found standing around the bar area socializing. Many young people would do this without a supervisor to monitor them. As many previous reviewers mentioned, the lazy river is fun. Our children enjoyed it. The downright bad: $5 for a botlle of water in the room. Hilton management, as a courtesy to your guests, make cold filtered water available and accessible to your guests at no charge. We had initially planned to stay at the Waldorf, but ended up at the Hilton because we thought it would be more child friendly. We did visit the Waldorf and it is definitely more geared towards an adult business type crowd, so we did not regret our choice. I used the fitness center and found it very good (thanks for the complimentary cold water). I would not return to this hotel because the quality of the food was not good enough and the service in the pool area left a lot to be desired. Also, it rained almost every day we were in Orlando (no big deal), but be aware that the policy at this hotel is that the entire pool area gets cleared when it rains. Fellow mothers I'm speaking to you now. This means that after you get your children ready to go in the pool (sunblock, bathing suits, etc), select your pool chairs, pick up your towels, get comfortable in your chair while your children get in the pool, you can finally relax and get out your book, right? Not exactly. The shrill \"weather alert\" alarm goes off and you are expected to pack up your stuff and leave the pool area for however long it rains (or appears overcast). Then, you can do it all over again in 2 hours. There were days that they opened and closed the pool area 2 to 4 times. I am sure this is just another policy in place to protect the hotel from litigation, but it got really annoying at times.

We had an amazing time! My 7-year old had so much fun on property that we had trouble getting him to the theme parks. The service was wonderful.

Making s'mores poolside and watching a movie from your inner tube...what could be more fun! The restauarant had something nice for families...kids eat free!!! We happened to be staying there over a BBQ weekend. It was a blast...baked bean contest, celebrity BBQ chefs, poolside BBQ's. They also had Radio Disney there with activities for the kids too. I work in a hotel in a resort town and consider myself picky when it comes to customer service. This hotel didn't miss a beat. From the friendly staff to daily 'words in towels' on the pooldeck, my family and I felt like everyone was happy to have us there.

This hotel is an amazing alternative to a Disney hotel. Our room was beautiful, cleaned to a high standard everyday. A quiet spot after the hustle and bustle of the Parks plus the hotel itself is spotless! The food is delicious I could recommend every dish on the menu in the Harvest Bistro where two kids eat free with each paying adult for breakfast and evening meal. The only problem we encountered at the restaurant was regarding the childrens evening meals maybe it was the time of year but they only held a dinner buffet at weekends so the children were required to choose from the lunch menu, if they ate lunch at the hotel having same menu in the evening was less than appetizing! The house water in the harvest Bistro is triple filtered and free its not worth paying for bottled! Also the small shop in the Harvest Bistro sells a selection of wine which can be purchased from about $10 a better alternative to the $40 bottle if room service is used. If you require water for your room buying from the Harvest Bistro is a cheaper alternative to either the water supplied in your room or even water bought at the Disney parks! We also ate at La Luce the italian restaurant in the Hilton and were less than impressed the service was good but the food poor. The Muse cafe sells sandwiches cakes and coffee which are delicious but unfortunately on the downside the coffee is served in paper cups! There is also a microwave in the Muse cafe for heating bottles or toddlers food. The Beech restaurant and bar by the pool are excellent, after purchasing adult and childrens drinks children then get free fill ups all day! This offer also includes the Lobby Bar. There is also free iced water by the hotel pool. The lazy river is brilliant a float ring is a must they can be hired for $5 a day or bought for $10 if staying for any length of time this is the best option as they will be well used, this hotel is the best kept secret in the disney area, we often had the pool to ourselves, the most busy time being weekends! The movies under the stars by the pool are fun for the kids to, but take plenty of bug spray I was badly bitten one night. The complimentory bus service to Disney Parks works really well the drivers are very informative and helpful. If your going to Universal the hotel will arrange a cab for you parties of four will cost $30 per cab each way. Parties of 5 or more $42 per shuttle each way. We used this service three times it worked really well the drivers were reliable and always returned at the time required. There is also a complimentory shuttle from the hotel each day at 12.55 to Lake Buna Vista shopping Mall with timetable returns, stores include Nine West (lovely handbags and shoes ladies) also Ashworth Reebok and Many others. Other premium outlets require a taxi at a cost of $36 or $21 each way depending on the length of the journey(.A little hint If you are going to the parks with young children don't book Askershus the food is abismal, The Polynesian Dinner show at disney is well worth the money a fun night out. Bongo's Cafe in downtown disney is good, and so is Portobello's.) Remember though if you hire a car the parking charges for guests at the Hilton are pretty steep and there is no alternative parking! So to sum up if you are thinking of booking the Hilton don't hesitate we stayed there with four children the staff were kind and helpful and it is very child friendly we had an amazing time Enjoy!", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel for our 1st family Disney trip\u201d", "Author": "NEMMom", "ReviewID": "UR117829879", "Content": "I went there recently as a single Mom with my 3 children.

You can also use the Waldorf Hotel facilities which is the adjacent hotel, but I think the Hilton is the best choice,especially for families. I cannot find any fault in this hotel and the Management should be complimented on having such excellent satt who are so efficient and make you so welcome. I do not think you will find a better hotel in Orlando. The main restaurants are very good but not cheap. The coffee shop Muse is excellent and very good value, especially with their coffee refills! The main bar also provides good lunches. The fitness centre is one of the very best we have used in any hotel. Everything is spotlessly clean.

This hotel over exceeded our expectations. The pros: The staff were very accomodating and most of them very friendly. The rooms were well appointed extremely clean, very nice linens and bathrooms accessories and nice big vanity, beds perfect with excellent pillows, great temperature control as well; the housecleaning did an excellent job every day, 100% hat's off to them! The Havest Bistro was excellent for breakfast, good choices from buffet. The view from our room was so beautiful. My daughters used both the pool, lazy river and exercise facilities, which were clean and well kept. Always clean warm pool towels, The concierge's desk was excellent with directions around the area. Parking worth the $13.00 a day, security, covered and in close proximity to the hotel. The shuttle to Disney is a beautiful bus, not just a regular city bus, very nice drivers, and good returns. The only con's I had were that it would have been nice to have a \"laundry facility\" on site. I found the cost of the laundry service available very high so we didn't do any laundry, which would have been nice to do. The other issue we had was when a large conference came in during our stay the people from the conference were drinking and smoking \"IN\" in the pool and hot tub. This was brought to the attention of the staff and I believe this was taken care of. They definitely were not respectful of other paying guests by their behaviour My last con was that when booking this hotel we pre-paid, and in doing this you not only get an excellent rate, but it included breakfast for the adults and kids. When we arrived we were advised that kids meant 12 and under. When booking on line, kids is considered 18 and under. The wording is as follows: \"Hilton guests may also dine at Harvest Bistro, where kids eat free for breakfast and dinner.\" I note that in other places on the web site it says 12 and under, but in this particular special it does not indicate that. The front desk advised me that they could not pay for my 13 and 15 year old's breakfast, but their did give me a $50 voucher to use in lieu of the misunderstanding. Just ensure if anyone books with this rate, that your kids are 12 and under to receive the free breakfast. As mentioned in other reviews, you should have a car if you plan to go anywhere other than Downtown Disney and the Parks, unless you don't mind paying for cabs.

The Good: The pool is superb a great lazy river (although quite powerful maybe not that lazy). The rooms were very clean and well equipped. The bed was so good my father is looking a buying the same one! The less good: Took two attempts to fix an overly cold fridge (frozen soda cans exploded!)

I thought I would put a few points under headings based on our experience at the hotel. Transport from the Airport We booked an American Coach as neither of us fancied driving on right hand side of the road plus I believe you have to pay each day for car parking. It took about 35-40 minutes to reach the hotel so this was very quick and easy. Checking in We were very impressed with check in. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeting by a very friendly lady floor walking in the lobby with a clipboard. She showed us to the main desk and when she realised we had waited about 30 seconds she immediately went and fetched an additional member of staff from the back to assist us. Check in was smooth and we were offered 2 key cards and a spare if we wanted it. Rooms- First impression WOW! The first thing we noticed was the huge window and the lovely view across a wooded area and downtown Disney in the background. The room was equipped with a hairdryer, flat screen TV, iron, ironing board, bath products, plenty of electrical sockets. There was some sort of coffee making facility but we were unsure how to use this and as tea drinkers a kettle would have really been better for us as we had to go down and buy tea each morning from the coffee shop. The room was very clean, nice bedding and towels. The only water provided in the room was $5 a bottle so we left this, it would have been nice to have a bottle of the house bottled water on arrival, as they give this out freely in the pool bar and restaurants. The bath products are lovely and are topped up as often as you need them. Breakfast The all you can eat $19 breakfast was really good although we only had this one day as $40 for breakfast each day would soon mount up. Most days we had a cup of tea and a croissant from the coffee shop for about $5 each. Dinner We ate at La Luce a couple of times and the Harvest bistro once. We were pleased with both. The food at La Luce is amazing we ate there 3 times in a week; the wine is quite pricey though. We found that our service varied quite a lot, we were served by a man in Harvest who was very friendly and attentive, at La Luce we had waiters two of the days and the service was average, but then we were served on the third day by Stephanie and she was fantastic and made our experience really special. Pool Side Bar A fairly good selection of drinks we had some cocktails which were really tasty again the service varied here depending on who served you, but there were a lot of flies at the bar which is a bit off-putting. Pool We loved the pool. The lazy river is so much fun even for two adults, the spa pool is lovely and warm- great in the evenings. You can always get a bed and clean towels are always available. You can hire a ring from the pool shop for $5 a day or buy one for $10. Transportation The buses to Disney are great. You get a timetable which is very easy to understand the drivers are entertaining and very knowledgeable, the buses run until at least 8pm-11pm depending on which park you are at so you will have plenty of time to watch the fireworks. The hotel is right on Disney which is great for the Disney parks but you will have to arrange your own transport to Universal and other attractions. Our rep booked us a shuttle to Universal and back which was $38 dollars for a round trip. There are town cars outside owned by Mears Transportation they charged us $13 to go from the hotel to downtown Disney and when we flagged a taxi down for the way back it was only $8 with another company. The hotel is in the middle of nowhere as far as walking goes. So you will need to allocate enough money for taxis. Guest Information Folder This was extremely frustrating. Upon arriving at a hotel I like to relax, have a drink and read the guest info file and get to know my way around. The file doesn\u2019t provide enough information and you have to find a lot out for yourself, we were constantly asking the concierge and reception questions. Room Service We ordered a bottle of wine one night to our room as there are no shops around to buy any- or so we thought. After spending $40 (and waiting 20 minutes) for our wine we discovered on the last day there is a section in the Harvest Bistro that sells wine starting at about $12, so I would recommend doing this. Notes for English travellers: A few points for people travelling from England about Florida in general. 1. TIPPING: It is now expected that you will tip between 18%-20%, which does increase your food and drink bill considerably. It is a bit of a shock at first coming from a generally non-tipping nation. 2. USA CUSTOMS: It will probably take ages to get through immigration/customs and they don\u2019t think twice about shouting at you. 3. ID: We are 26 and got asked for ID everywhere when buying alcohol; except the hotel who are much better at using their own common sense and judgment.

Overall, it is a great place to stay when visiting Disney. The Hilton and Waldorf hotels at Bonnet Creek are connected by shared conference facilities. The good thing about this is that you can use the pools and other amenities of both hotels no matter at which one you stay. The rooms, lobby and facilities are all clean. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. The prices are good when compared to the nearby Disney owned hotels. The staff is very friendly. The Hilton has a lazy river pool that is very inviting. If you get bored with that pool there are two pools at the Waldorf that you can also use. The property is surrounded on three sides by Disney property so there are views of Disney and the location is very convenient for visiting the parks. There is a free shuttle bus service to the parks that is very reliable and convenient. The hotel staff offers activites for children for times when they are not at the parks. While we were there, each night at 9PM a disney movie was shown poolside. There are only two complaints about this hotel. The first is the price of the food. A mediocre tasting hamburger from the grill near the pool is $14. Even factoring in the convenience, it is nowhere near worth that much money. It is less expensive to eat and drink in the Disney parks. Yikes!! The second complaint is about the parking facilities. This is a warning to watch out for the valets in the parking garage. The hotel offers valet parking and the valets tend to think the parking garage is a racetrack when they are parking cars. Be very careful or you will get run over. Additionally, the parking garage has several spaces reserved for hybrid cars. However, on the many trips to the garage to get the car so we could go and get food for the family, those spaces reserved for hybrid cars were practically always full of non-hybrid gas guzzlers.

I'm a Disney veteran with literally dozens of trips to the park since it opened in 1971. Upgraded to one of their allergy-free Pure rooms for $20/night. Well worth the $ for us allergy sufferers!!!! I used to travel for a living and have stayed everywhere. This was by far the easiest breathing room I've seen - better than home. That sounds weird. To make such a big deal over the room environment - and I was initially reluctant to spend the money. But what a difference it made in terms of sound sleeps and waking up without even the slightest sniff of musty air conditioners or dust. No balconies for any of the rooms, if that's important to you. Other pros: Property and physical plant were gorgeous. Easily on par with some of the better hotels I've enjoyed. Rooms are beautiful, lobby is wonderful, and pool was impeccably clean. Breakfast buffet was definitely worth the $20. Unfortunately, 11 year old was always too anxious to get on the Disney road each morning and never really enjoyed it. Staff was friendly and efficient. Some of the newer Concierge staff could have been a lot more knowledgeable, even not sure of shuttle schedules while looking at the printed paper. Location: gorgeous. In the middle of a surprising nature reserve. But see the transportation concerns below. Cons: Location. Rent a car. Rent a car. Rent a car. Can't say it enough. Cabs will cost you minimum $20 each way if you get cabin fever and have the urge for even a fast food joint at the end of the driveway/entrance, which is much too far to walk with an 11 year old. This place really is in the middle of a nature reserve and it's not a quick walk out. Cabs: Hotel has an arrangement with the nice but higher priced Mears town cars. These are the only vehicles you'll find waiting at the front door. You can phone a 'regular' less expensive cab from off property to come to get you (also most owned by the Mears empire), but it' s a wait and inconvenient We really did feel like prisoners after a few days. Shuttles to Disney: Don't get me started. Somewhat convenient because they do keep to the schedule, but lengthy trips to anywhere but Epcot. IMPORTANT! Last shuttles leave the parks just before the nightly fireworks shows begin. Bring your wallet for an expensive cab back to the hotel. Even if a later shuttle might be scheduled at some point, the massive crowds leaving the parks at the same time will most likely make shuttle impossible to catch. Discussion with Hotel Manager was frustrating: he told me the shuttles are geared to the typical Disney tourist and leave when the parks close. This is disingenuous: Yes, the parks do 'officially' close before the fireworks, but it's a real stretch to believe the typical visitor, who might come to Disney once or twice in their lifetime, would leave before the wonderful nightly fireworks spectacles. Thousands and thousands of people remaining in the park, eating and buying souvenirs, enjoying the Disney fireworks shows.....and the hotel thinks the Disney day is over? Give me a break. There are lots of cabs, but this could be a very unpleasant unanticipated extra cost after draining your bank account during the day at the park. Hotel Food: Kids eat fee with adult purchase downstairs at the Bistro. As above, breakfast buffet was wonderful with incredible assortment, live chefs, and pleasant room. Do NOT do the dinner. Kids eat off a special kids' menu. Very limited and quality is not anywhere near the adult menu items, which are not great in their own right. The 2nd night, I finally listened to the 11 yr old and tried a bite of his burger. I've had better cardboard. Kitchen was not busy (very slow period) so that was not the problem. Adult entrees were at best so-so the 3 nights we ate there. Not worth the money. Room service food: Comes from the same Bistro kitchen reviewed above. Need I say more? Avoid it and get a nice pizza from the upscale and friendly Luce in the lobby, purportedly run by a totally different operation. That's why they can't deliver the Luce food to your room, but they are very happy to make it to go. And it's a quick elevator ride upstairs. No excuse, avoid the Bistro at lunch or dinner, even with the free kids deal. Pool: Wonderfully clean and nice 'lazy river' for floating. Pool: No deeper area to keep 11 yr old happy and lazy river gets very old after 1 or 2 times around. Money saving tip: buy a cheap tube at the pool house for $10 if you plan on using the pool several days. Rentals are at least $5/day. Bring your own if you like. People with cars were running out to the discount stores to get the same tubes for just a couple $. Water slide is for much younger kids. Boring fir an 11 year old. Pool food: Come out of the same Bistro kitchen reviewed above. Need I say more? Appetizers are passable, Service slow. Avoid the entrees. Hilton Honors points: My mistake. We booked a package through Sun Country airlines from Minneapolis. Then I spent an additional fortune at the Hilton beyond the basic rooms, (the least was the $20/night upgrade for the 'Pure' room). Hilton absolutely refused to give me any points for the additional $1000 I spent, because I did not book directly and had gone through a 'wholesaler.' Even for the monies I spent outside the wholesaler. This is a stated part of the fine print for HiltonHonors. Again, my mistake. Read your fine print carefully if points are important. Bottom line: I'd return but with a rental car. I've stayed in at least a dozen properties in the Disney area over the years and this had to be one of the most enjoyable at any price I've paid. You should easily be able to avoid the few pitfalls I mentioned above and have an absolutely wonderful time at this property.

Our room is worth up to $200 a night EASY, but it can be had for below $100 if you know where to look.

The staff is friendly and the visitors to the property all seem to be of a higher class then at your typical sub-$100 properties. They do hit you for a parking charge if you have a vehicle with you, but because the room is such a good value I can't complain about that. (Really they should charge an extra $13 a night and not say it's for parking, as it bothers me that hotels are charging for parking now a days.)

We were very impressed with our stay at the Hilton Bonnet Creek. Here are a few reasons why: 1. The lazy river is fun for couples and for families. Yes, it can get crowded but it wasn't that bad and we were there over the 4th of July weekend. I suggest you buy a small raft before you arrive. If not, you can buy or rent them at the pool. Rentals are $5 a day and the prices to buy their rafts range from $6-$13. If you are there for more than one day, buy the raft. If you are concerned that you will not have room in your suite case when you leave to take it home there are tons of families that would be so happy to have your raft when you are done with it. At night the hotel shows a movie (Shrek, etc.) on a big screen next to the pool for your family to enjoy. Also, I don't know if it was because it was a holiday weekend or not but the hotel had blow up giant slides for you to play on. My husband and I didn't ... but it looked fun for the kids. 2. There are many choices for places to eat. While we were at the pool area on a Saturday we had the small of ribs, chicken and burgers on an open grill to temp us. In addition there is a small cafe type next to the pool as well as an inside/ outside restaurant to dine at if you wish. 3. Our room was fantastic. We asked to have a view of the pool area and to our delight we could see fireworks at night from the nearby parks. We could see into a room next to us that was being cleaned (as we walked by) and they had a small kitchen. If I had kids I would go this route because breakfast was expensive on property. 4. The Hilton Bonnet Creek is very close to Disney. We were minutes away from Downtown Disney and the parks. There were busses available to take you to the parks if you wanted to take that route. 5. We ate at La Luce on the property for dinner one night and the food was good. Not amazing... but pretty good. The atmosphere was excellent and they had a great wine selection. The service was so so... the waiter was very nice but just slow. We chose to eat there because it was two minutes from our room and we were tired from the Disney parks that day... we were happy with that dinner choice because of the convenience. 6. Every morning we had breakfast at the hotel. We are Hilton Gold members so it was free for a continental breakfast or $6 for hot... we did the hot every morning. If you had to pay full price it was $20 per person. Is it worth $20 per person? The convenience of a filling breakfast before a day at the parks makes the $20 a person well worth it. 7. The staff was wonderful. We did not run into one person who wasn't a pleasure to be around and happy to be working at this hotel. 8. We had free high speed internet. I am not sure if this was free to everyone or if it was free to us because we are Hilton Gold members. Either way, being connected was nice. Some of the downfalls: 1. The parking garage is $13 a night... not too bad and reasonable for this area. Park on the 2nd level... that level will take you over to the hotel without needing a elevator or stairs. 2. Hopefully you love kids because there are A Lot of them. We didn't mind them and enjoyed seeing them have so much fun. If you are looking for a quiet romantic weekend away without kids floating past you with water guns... maybe you would want to pick another resort. Maybe the Waldorf Astoria next door? That is all that I can think of. as far as downfalls.

This year we thought we would try the Hilton Bonnet Creek (both stays were wtih Hilton point). We were very impressed. Location - we preferred this location to the Doubletree. We felt closer to all the parks and the dedicated shuttle was nice. The Doubltree wasn't a problem, but the shuttle did make a lot of stops. The shuttle was always on time, and the drivers were very professional and courteous. Property - the rooms are typical hotel rooms. The hotel is new enough so nothing is run down. We found the beds to be firm but extremely comfortable. We slept like babies. Of course, we were so tired after the long hot days at the parks. The hotel lobby is huge with a nice lobby bar. There was another bar (Zeta) off to the side with a very nice, contemporary design. We enjoyed a drink after the parks one night, but was disappointed that they allowed 10 yr old kids to sing karaoke. Around 11:15 they finally asked the kids to leave. Sorry, as an adult I enjoy an adult beverage in an adult establishment with other adults. Parking - we chose the self park at $13 a day, you use your room key to get in and out of the ramp and the charges get billed to your room. As Diamond members we were given free wifi access. Honestly, I can't figure out why it isn't free to everyone these days. Food - since we were out and about each day, our only experience with the food was a late night room service of chicken wings and chicken fingers. I will give them a 7 out of 10. Pool area - looked gorgeous and many were using it, however, we were there for a wknd only and spent our time at the Disney parks. Overall, we were very pleased with our choice and will definately consider this hotel again for our trip next year!", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cProfessional service, fantastic pool\u201d", "Author": "Dottybug", "ReviewID": "UR115033271", "Content": "We stayed here for a week for our big trip to Disney and Universal. It's a very beautiful new hotel so everything felt clean and fresh. All staff members are friendly and extremely professional. This hotel is just off I-4 so it's easy to get to Universal and SeaWorld if you rent a car. The free hotel shuttle service to Disney were always right on time so get to the shuttle stop at the scheduled time or you will miss it. Odd numbered rooms have a Disney view, very nice view overlooking the pool and golf course. At first glance I thought the room small, but once we spread out we realized there was plenty enough room for our 3 suitcases, and the 4 of us didn't feel crammed in. We really liked that there was an extra table in the room on wheels, it came in handy for times we ate in the room or just to put the suitcase on. The big negative of this hotel for us was that there were no coin operated washers and dryers. We were there for a week so it would have been nice to be able to wash while we were there and pack less. The pool is way cool. There are fun activities every day for kids like movies at night. We brought tube floats from home to save money since you have to rent them at the pool. When we made our reservations, there was a package for a few dollars more per night that included breakfast for two at the Harvest Bistro - well worth the extra cost! Just about anything you could want for breakfast, they have it. It can get crowded but we never had to wait longer than 15 minutes to get seated. Empty trays of food are replaced very quickly so if something runs out, come back in a couple of minutes and it will be full. It can get expensive eating at the theme parks so we usually opted to eat near the hotel for dinner. A good area to find many places to eat is along 535. Follow the signs to Downtown Disney (E. Buena Vista Road). Stay on the road past Downtown Disney until it intersects with 535 (S. Apopka Vineland Rd). The CrossRoads Shopping Center at this intersection has many places to eat, plus a cool mini golf course. Or if you turn left (north) onto 535 there are other options. Also on 535 is a Winn Dixie about a block north of the Steak and Shake. We bought bottled water and ponchos at Winn Dixie, which was a great investment since it rained at about 2:30 every afternoon while we were there - that's very normal summer weather apparently, so be prepared! Ponchos at Universal are $8, just so you know, probably the same at Disney. We really enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. If you are a Hilton Honors member, there are perks so ask about them. There are other options besides earning points for your stay, so find out what deals are offered at the time. Just FYI if you rent a car: when you head back to the airport take the 417 highway (via 536) instead of I-4/528 because you can fill up at the 7-11 or Hess station along the way. Both are about 2 miles from the hotel on World Center Drive (Hwy 536), just before getting on the 417. From what I understand, gas stations closer to the airport are way more expensive and hard to find. The few miles you drive to the airport will not affect the full tank meter on the rental car enough for them to charge you.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Terryville, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful & great fun for the kids but expensive\u201d", "Author": "jennv21", "ReviewID": "UR115016394", "Content": "My family (2 adults, 2 kids) traveled to Orlando recently for my children's first trip to Disney.

My kids loved the pool with the lazy river and slide (for kids taller than 40\"). They also had a nightly movie that was set up by the pool so that the kids could swim and enjoy the movie after a long hot day at Disney. I do recommend that you stop at Walmart and stock up on drinks, snacks, and a tube for the pool. The hotel does offer to sell or rent you a tube, but the price is excessive. They do provide plenty of pool seating and towels. This is one of those hotels that has a lot of extras that cost a lot extra. Self parking is $13 per day, but the bus to Disney is part of the pkg and it is very nice but you do need to plan your return times. The shuttle offers a website accessible from your mobile phone that eases the scheduling for departures/returns. Wireless internet is also an extra that requires additional charges and they have bottled water in your room that cost $5 per bottle. We did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants, the menus didn't seem to kid friendly and the prices were scary.

The hotel has a great pool with a gentle slope into the pool and also a lazy river that keeps the water moving around the pool area. Really relaxing and the kids loved it. You can rent a raft tube for $5/day or buy a colorful one for $7 to keep for your stay (or you can bring one from home or a new one from the store to blow up). They also have a nice bar (covered) with nice seating and kind of a south-beachy feel. Also really fun for the kids is a windy water slide that the kids REALLY loved. It has an attendant that stands watching over the children. The Harvest restaurant downstairs can provide for breakfast and lunch. They do have a fancy restaurant called La Luce (I think). They also have a coffee shop upstairs (no Starbucks here... not even in the room. Lavazza coffee served). My only gripe in the room was the shower was a rain-type shower that seemed to take me forever to get my hair soaked! Definitely probably not my favorite type. They need to improve the shower curtain situation too as water would get all over the floor in the bathroom. I tried everything to prevent but could only to an extent prevent this from happening. $13 per day self-parking garage next door. They will valet park your car, but not sure of this price. Overall, we had a nice stay and my husband says the conference facilities were very adequate. It also has it's own bus stop with a resort bus that goes to Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Hollywood Studios and somewhere else (I forgot already!). Runs late. 11:20 last pickup from Magic Kingdom.

However since I have stayed at so many of the Disney World resorts I had to compare it to that the entire time. This hotel is newer and beautiful. It has a huge pool and plenty of chairs. We paid extra for a \"theme park\" view, and I don't recommend you pay the money for that because you could only see Hollywood studios from our room, and it was very far away. Not worth the extra money. The hotel provides a shuttle bus to all the parks, but it was no comparison to how frequently the Disney shuttle bus system runs. The hotel shuttle only ran at specific times and getting home later at night we found ourselves waiting. But I will say we were on a not very crowded coach bus, where the Disney shuttles tend to be standing room only. I missed the \"Disney feel\" at this hotel. There is nothing like staying at a Disney brand hotel, and even though this hotel is right in the heart of Disney, it still felt worlds away. The prices here were excellent, and you are getting a much nicer hotel for the money than you would at a Disney resort. The price of this hotel compares with a \"moderate\" hotel on Disney property. We've stayed at a \"moderate\" resort, and will not be going back to one! This hotel blows a Disney moderate hotel out of the water. Another down side is you have to pay for parking. If you stay at a Disney resort the \"Magical Express\" will take you to and from the airport to your hotel free of charge. We wound up renting a car and paying for parking everyday. I'm not sure how much a cab ride from the airport to hotel would be, but that might be a cheaper option. And when you don't stay at a Disney hotel you cannot get the meal plan, which I highly recommend. So if you are thinking about staying here and you've never stayed on Disney property, I think you will love it! If you have stayed at the finer Disney resorts, you may find yourself missing something. Tough decision!

If you plan to visit any of the Disney Parks they have complimentary shuttles,(to and from), several times a day The staff was very attentive to our needs poolside and through out the hotel. We found restaurants reasonably priced, as well. The hotel is connected through expansive halls and conference facilities to the Waldorf Astoria. We dined one night at The Bull and Bear. It was absolutely wonderful. If you are a guest at the Hilton you can use the alot of the amenities at the Waldorf too. We will definitely go back to the Hilton Orlando Bonnet Creek next time we return to Orlando.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Providence, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Experience\u201d", "Author": "BrownSt13", "ReviewID": "UR113181271", "Content": "My family: 3 adults and a pre-teen boy stayed at this hotel for 5 days. My father attended conference here and the rest of the family visited the Disney parks. Here's a simple run down of pros, cons, and comments: Pros: -Excellent customer service -Very quiet rooms because of thick walls, doors, and curtains. If we didn't have a clock, we would have thought it was still night. -The pool has a lazy river, my brother loved it! -Game room (We played some pool and guitar Hero...not free btw.) -Excellent food: I recommend the Buffet at Harvest Bistro, La Luce for dinner, poolside grill for drinks, the pastries at Harvest Bistro (Delicious brownies!). -Free transportation to the Disney Parks; the bus is really comfy and they have departure and pick up times throughout the day. Cons: -Our toilet was near broken: really really slow -The shower head was a little too gentle -When you ask for a taxi, you don't get the regular yellow taxi...you get a classy-looking, 2x more expensive ride. -The elevators could have been better placed, our room was quite away from it Further Recommendations: -Remember the Concierge can be a great help -The strawberry shortcake drink, pina colada, strawberry smoothie, and kid's chicken fingers from the poolside grill is excellent. But the chicken salad was disappointing. Also there's normally a staff member who will walk around the pool and take your order. -La Luce is a bit more pricey, but the food is absolutely delicious. My veal chop was spiced and cooked perfectly. The butterscotch pudding and the cantaloupe vodka drink were excellent as well. -From Muse (the main coffee and pastry shop), I recommend the almond croissant. -Remember that not all the shuttle buses go to the same Disney parks. -Certain medicine are available for purchase at Harvest Bistro's grab and go -You can pay an extra $10 per night to get a view of Disneyland", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Standish, Maine", "Title": "\u201cNice Place if this is what you want\u201d", "Author": "SebagoGuy", "ReviewID": "UR113167194", "Content": "I was here at a business convention in March, with no rental car I had no real alternative, with the exception of the Waldorf attached to the other side of the convention center. The Hilton is a large property, very well maintained, very close to the Disney properties and probably a choice for families who can afford an upscale hotel with shuttle service to the Disney venues. I don't like being in resorts hotels that are too far from anything but on-property shops, restaurants, etc. so not the type of place I would choose (especially if I was paying out of pocket). However the lobby, room, and service were very nice. There was a beautiful pool with a \"river\" circulating around it for the youngsters, and movies were shown outside by the pool one evening. I had a terrific meal in the Italian restaurant off the lobby, and an overpriced buffet in the family restaurant in the lower level. There are a few coffee shop/sandwich options, and you could walk to the Waldorf for other choices. You can get a drink poolside and grab a shuttle to several local attractions, but there are generally no cabs lurking nearby, just more expensive town cars. My room had a great view and nice amenities (free WiFi only because I was with a group) If you're on business in the area and expensing it off, and need some quite place to stay this is nice.

There was a lifeguard or employee named Danielle that was great with the kids. She was mainly at the slide, but she showed the kids how to make towel oragami. The kids went crazy over that. This is something usually done at Disney and it was great to see this being done elsewhere. She was awesome with the kids and very attentive with them.

The service the staff provide is unbelievable, we were treated like royalty for 2 weeks. When we first arrived we asked if there was ant chance of an upgrade, which the receptionist did with ease, complimentary, we were upgraded to a Disney view and you can see the fireworks around 10pm from Disney. The room was spacious with daily maid service and clean towels everyday. We had breakfast in the harvest bistro most mornings but at 19 dollars per person it is an expensive start to your day, however there was lots of choice. This hotel is great for families who spend a lot of time at Disney due to the free shuttles, however my partner and I spent a lot of time at universal which meant we had to get a taxi, do not get the black cabs that the hotel provide, the journey will cost double the price, just ask one of the outside attendants to order you a yellow cab, and they arrive within 10 minutes. It cost us around 30 dollars to get to universal, around 20 dollars to the outlets, and around 15 dollars to some nearby resturants. I think if this hotel offered free shuttles to universal as well as Disney, it would increase this hotels appeal. The outside 'beech' snack bar was brilliant for a few drinks or a bite to eat, they offered free refills on soft drinks and sodas which was a bonus. We ate at La Luce, one of the restaurants inside the hotel, it was lovely but expensive. The lazy river was an added bonus and the kids seem to throughly enjoy the night time film that was played on a big screen by the pool. We had to pay for use of the wifi in our room, however we found that if you walked down to the lobby to connect, you could keep your signal in your room for 24 hours, so we just did this to avoid paying! I think the wifi charge is silly in a hotel of such stature, and maybe a free wifi service would be another benefit.

ROOM LOCATION - the corridors are a bit long so if you like your room closer to the elevator, make sure to ask for it when you check in CABS - the cabs on-site are the livery cabs, so they always charge more than the yellow cabs you can catch coming back from the park", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cStaffs are very accommodating and friendly\u201d", "Author": "Lyn123NewJersey", "ReviewID": "UR109742335", "Content": "Great kids pool, good food ( brunch), Staffs are very accommodating and nice.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThe Best!\u201d", "Author": "chicitylady", "ReviewID": "UR109735493", "Content": "Love the service at this hotel.

I feel that it is a better value as well as a nicer, cleaner hotel than some of the Disney resorts.

The reception area is large and bright and the overall feel of the hotel reminded me of a Vegas style accommodation - perhaps it's because of the large conference wing attached to the hotel. Our room was nice, with a lovely view over the pool and golf course. Maid service wasn't as good as I've experienced in other 4/5 star hotels - whilst the room was left clean, I got the impression they just 'tickled' round and there were no nice touches like the folding of night wear or tidying of shoes that you usually get. We ate breakfast in the buffet restaurant some days and it was lovely - huge choice and lots of it! It did come to about $60 per day for 2 of us though, so can soon add up if you go everyday. An alternative is the coffee bar just off reception where you can buy very tasty pastries and coffee for about $15 for 2 people. The pool area is gorgeous with a nice lazy river. Inflatables for the lazy river are $5 per day. Pool staff are on hand to serve drinks and snacks from the poolside bar area. Each evening at 8 they show a 'dive in' movie - usually a Disney and it's a lovely touch. You definitely need a car if you stay here and valet parking is $20 per day or self park $13. Bring your own water etc for poolside as hotel prices were high $4 for small bottle of water. We didn't like Orlando itself, and were so pleased we chose this hotel as it really did feel like an oasis. I'd definitely stay there again if we returned.

The food service - several restaurants with skimpy menus lacking fresh ingredients. No fruit plate for example. Seriously....doesnt one expect something healthy and well done in this type of place? After one day....you're thinking \"and I have to do a week of this?\" The pool is nice but not spectacular....and they close it down to rent out to parties. So you might not even get to use it in the evening after a long day at the parks. There is no \"Disney\" view in any room of the actual castle...only distant fireworks and a view that points toward Disney -- where you're looking at some sort of bowling pin type structures at one of the Disney annexes. Also the walls are thin....so again, if the place if full, you will hear all the party goers coming back to play late at night. Out in front of the hotel are a line of coaches to take you anywhere.

I think advertising Disney View is a little misleading, because while you are technically looking \"at\" Disney property - I doubt it's what most people would be expecting. My version of Disney view is like the Swan or Dolphin resorts. All that said, the lazy river pool is great for the kids. It has a zero depth section and then a river section that runs in a loop with a current that will carry you around in about 5 minutes or so. The breakfast package was worth it, we were with two young children and kids eat free for breakfast and dinner at the hotel. The breakfast is a pretty good buffet with just about anything you could want.

No place is available to have your coffee and danish outside in the morning without sitting in a smoking area. Also, be careful with your kids in the parking lot, especially in the moring.

It is on the door step of Disney (Epcott etc) so if you are going to those parks it is ideal. My family chose the Universal parks and it still only took 20 minutes to drive there. On the downside the wardrobe space in a room which has two double beds really is not enough. It is just one small wardrobe which for a family of 4 on a 10 night stay is tight. I really did not enjoy the breakfast buffet at all - but in fairness I did not much enjoy the food in the States anywhere so maybe that can be put down to my taste. Like one of the other reports noted there must be a problem with the drauinage as our toilet backed up. The problem was sorted very quickly by the staff though. Oh and the pay per view tv service had to be fixed as well. i wa stold there are not enough feeds for the whole hotel so some rooms dont get a proper servce, but they remedy quickly when asked. The hotel is linked to the Waldorf and I recommend you stop by there especially if you dont have kids. it looked to have a nicer pool and pool side but was not as children orientated. We also ate at the Bull and bear at the Waldorf which was about the best meal we had on the trip. However even there my wife made enquiries about the crab they were serving. She asked what type of crab they used only to be told it was tinned crab - not a great thing to hear when the plate is being sold at $58! If you cant get fresh crab for $58 what hope is there? Also food and service at the Hiltons pool side beech Bar is not bad at all. My wife assures me the spa is excellent if that is of interest to you.

The Hilton is a very large hotel but from every person on the staff you are treated as an important guest.. Smiles everywhere.

Usually every half-hour. The bus is 1st class, and movies for the kids. No need to pay the $14.00 per day for parking at Disney lots...save the $$$ for food. For hotel food the Bistro's food was good; the breakfasts were excellent. Earlier I mentioned the special service but I want to give a 5 star to Amber in guest relations who exhibited spectacular assistance. Also, the young man, Kyle, who assisted us with baggage both at arrival and on departure was \"real\" if you know what I mean. No phoney smiles...just a pleasure to deal with!!

The bed is comfortable and the furnishings are what you would expect. The rooms are on the smaller side and the bathroom is quite small too. The shower is awful with no water pressure at all. Our room overlooked the front of the building and because we were on the third floor we could only see the top of the entrance and garage. Construction noise in this area started at 5am every morning. Don't bother with you laptop. Internet service is not included and is expensive. The pool area is very nice with a really great pool which everyone seemed to be enjoying and regular drink and food service. It is somewhat difficult to get a chair in the afternoon because of lots of chair saving and people not moving their towels when they have left for the day. I think the pool was the best feature for families. The service was good to excellent. The staff at the front desk were not very knowledgeable which was a problem when the concierge was not available. We were trying to get directions to a Disney golf course and they did not know where it was or how to find out. The concierge service was very good. Other staff were friendly and helpful. The restaurants are good but pricey. We had a lunch at the bistro which was not bad but the service was slow considering that it was late and the place was very quiet. We ate at the Italian restaurant on site twice out on the balcony and it was very good food with excellent service. We played at the Waldorf Astoria golf course on site twice and it is a really nice course. It is expensive in the morning so we played at 2pm both times and it was quite reasonable and a nice course. Parking is extra here at $13 a night. It is conveniently located and easy to find a parking spot. Do be careful walking in the parking garage or backing out your car. Staff moving cars for valet parking drive at extreme speeds in the garage and we had near misses on a number of occasions. It is extremely difficult to find this resort on a GPS.

It is an incredible, gigantic, modern hotel next to the Waldorf-Astoria. We arrived Friday afternoon, and there were a ton of front desk clerks waiting to help us. The room was excellent; much better than the traditional cookie-cutter Hilton rooms. We had a Disney view, which had great views of Epcot, Hollywood Studios, the Pop Century Resort, Caribbean Beach Resort, and even the Contemporary Resort. We also had a view of the pool from our room. The pool was incredible! It featured the zero-entry style entrance and had some 4 hot tubs and a water slide. The pool complex is one of the greatest pluses this property has. We want to stay here another time in the summer just to experience the pool scene. The staff would also shape towels into different letters by the pool to spell words like \"relax\" and \"unwind\" which was pretty cool. The fitness center is also very large, much larger than the usual 1-treadmill, 1-elliptical, 1-stationary bike Hilton fitness centers. The hotel had 3-4 restaurants. The first was a lobby coffee/pastry shop which looked pretty good. The second was a lobby lounge/bar type area. It had a very nice bar and pretty good food; I liked the caesar salad. The third was a buffet style restaurant below the lobby which had a great selection. The final restaurant was an Italian style restaurant that looked very trendy and yummy, but we could not eat here. Plus, there's a ton of other restaurants at the Waldorf-Astoria. The transportation system at this property is mediocre; it's not the best in the WDW area. The bus transports you to all four Disney parks every half hour. The bus also picks up guests from the Waldorf-Astoria which was a bit annoying. Then, the bus would leave you at the TTC (if going to Magic Kingdom), so you had to take the monorail to arrive at the park. In other words, there was no direct entrance \"on the other side of the lagoon\". When we left, we were also pleasantly surprised by the hotel. The valet attendants had left us a note in the car thanking us for staying at the hotel; this was a completely unexpected thing that I really liked. Overall, this hotel is great.

Our young children (6 & 3) enjoyed the pool/lazy river very much and the movies that were shown by the pool at night were a nice touch. It was very enjoyable to come back to the hotel at night and relax by the pool while watching a fun movie. I do think, however that the hotel could have done a better job of keeping the pool area tidy. There were alot of dirty towels and trash sitting next to empy seats during the day. However, the guest rooms were very clean and nice. We paid up for the Disney View which I don't really think was worth it. You can see the tiny speck of Mickey's Hat at Hollywood Studios in the distance and if you craned your neck, you could see the golf ball at Epcot. As for the restaurants, we had breakfast and one dinner at Harvest Bistro. The breakfast buffet was mediocre and it was pricey. The kids ate for free but that didn't really matter because our meals were so expensive. Food and drinks by the pool were equally pricey. My husband ordered a medium steak for dinner at Harvest Bistro and it was raw (not rare but raw). Taking the shuttle bus was okay. We found ourselves taking a cab a few times because return trips were less frequent. Also, on our way to Hollywood Studios, we had to stop off at Magic Kingdom then Animal Kingdom first which was a little tedious. I think this hotel is decent but I think for the same price, you could stay at the much nicer JW Marriott. We really don't mind paying up for something if we think it is worth it.

We usually stay at a Disney resort for vacation, but decided to branch out a bit. This hotel is VERY nice, almost too nice. At times you feel uncomfortable walking around the lobby in shorts and a t-shirt because everyone else is dressed to impress...either for a conference going on at the hotel or for dinner at one of the fancy restaurants. I can't comment on the food because we never ate at one of the restaurants. I just couldn't justify spending that much money on food. The parking at the hotel is very easy, but expensive - $13 a day. I suggest parking on level two nearest to the hotel. You'll have the least distance to walk. The pool is fantastic. My 4 year old daughter loved it. While she can swim a bit, she's still learning so it was nice that the pool doesn't get any deeper than 3 1/2 feet. The slide was a hit as she probably went down at least 173 times. The rooms were very nice and spacious. I'll be a little picky and say that the bathrooms were a little small, but overall no complaints. The view of the pool, golf course, and Disney was great. You can see Epcot, Hollywood Studios, and (sort of) the Animal Kingdom from the room if you get the Disney view. However, you won't be able to see the Magic Kingdom. One thing we did miss was the Disney atmosphere. Although, I know others have commented how they liked not being bombarded with the whole Disney vibe. If you are going for a Disney vacation, you may want to stay at a Disney resort instead. The shuttle is okay, but you'll have to walk pretty far to the Magic Kingdom as they drop you off in the parking lot and not right in front of the entrance. I read others complain about the location of the hotel, but I couldn't ask for anything better. If you have a car, it's less than 5 min. to downtown disney and less than 3 min. to the Boardwalk.

Overall, the hotel was a pleasant surprise--much nicer than I expected for a large hotel in a family destination. Rooms - the rooms weren't huge but were adequate and clean, and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was kind of awkward. First, there was no bathtub, just a shower. This was fine for my husband and me, but I can imagine would be inconvenient for a family with young children who require a bathtub (we had a King room; perhaps there are bathtubs in the double rooms). Also, the shower door seemed to open the wrong way (i.e., the hinge was on the wrong side), which made it harder for 2 people to be in the bathroom at once. Also, the A/C was noisier than we would have expected for a relatively new hotel...but at least worked well. Location - the location was great for us, only a 5-minute drive from ESPN Wide World of Sports. It was also very close to Downtown Disney. We didn't visit any of the parks from this hotel, so I'm not sure how convenient the hotel is to Epcot, Magic Kingdom, etc. Pool - the pool area was nicer than I expected. The pool itself is huge, and the beach entry, lazy river and water slide are nice touches. If you want an inner tube, they're $5 to rent. There is towel service, and attendants were readily available to help with chairs, bring food/drink and clean up towels. There was also a DJ, so the pool area was pretty noisy.

Cost - we used Hilton Rewards points for our stay--I think otherwise the room rates were about $280 per night, which is probably a bit high for this hotel (though maybe the high rates were due to spring break). Misc. - Check-in and valet staff were consistently very helpful. Parking was $13 per night, plus tax, and included in-and-out with your room key. The parking lot is shared with the Waldorf on the other side of the property, so it's huge (write down where you parked--the spaces are numbered) and a bit of a hike from hotel check-in (so drop off your stuff at the front door before parking if you have a lot of luggage). They also offer valet, but I think it's $20 for overnight.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cOK\u201d", "Author": "NB099", "ReviewID": "UR100941549", "Content": "I'm Hilton Diamond.

The iron is broken and leaks. Ironing board is cheap and leaves marks on clothes due to thin cover. Iron deposits white flakes on clothes. 2 of the 4 lights in the bathroom don't work. Water is $5 a bottle (Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn, Homewood Suites give me free water). Internet speed: ping-132ms, Download - 2.47Mps, Upload .69Mbps. Clock can't been seen in the dark - not backlit, requiring lamp to be turned on to tell the time. Room itself is on the small side with only one desk chair, one chair for guests and a miniature table covered in marketing material. Lampshade is dented and dirty. Front desk staff are slightly apathetic, not bad, not great, just average. \"Disney view\" room is a joke. Sure, Disney is to the NorthWest of the hotel. Somewhere. The room has a nice view of a golf course and trees. But I wouldn't call it a \"view\" of Disney. Hotel parking is $13 a day. This is suburban Florida. Why is there any parking charge at all? The parking spots are about the smallest I've ever seen, except at the Embassy Suites Vanderbilt. On the plus side, the parking is in a garage, nice when it rains every afternoon here in the summer. This place was next to impossible to find. It is called \"Bonnet Creek\" but is NOT on Bonnet Creek Parkway. There's a nice LG tv in the room. But cable tv was pixelated and dropping out last night. Some of the channels could not be watched at all. This morning, I've seen fewer problems. The pool area here is pretty nice. But buy your own tubes at Wal-Mart before coming here. They have a small \"lazy river\" at the pool. Overall, all hotels have issues. I'd call this an above-average average Hilton. I've stayed in far worse. I've stayed in better.

This is a cousin hotel of the Waldorf Astoria (which I have raved about in two other reviews). It is connected to the Waldorf via the Convention Center which is in between the two hotels. There is a large parking garage, which we didn't use, because it is a long walk to the front doors, so we used the valet parking. The valet parking is needing a little bit of help, due to it seemed that they don't have their act together. As we pulled up and a valet attendent greeted us, he asked if we wanted valet service, which I answered \"yes\", and then he just waited there with me. I asked if there was Bell Service, and he looked around as if he was lost for words. This was disappointing considering that at the Waldorf, Valet is right there, and Bell Service steps right in (maybe I'm a bit spoiled by the Waldorf!). Bell Service did come up, and we were brought up to the room. Now Bell Service is excellent, and the man who help us was a true gentleman!!! If you ever stay here, ask for Brad. He will take care of you. He is and will be the reason why we would come back. We even seen him a few more times during our stay, and our kids got along with him. He would spend time point out where things were located around the area (malls, eateries, etc.). He's enough of a reason to keep coming back to this hotel. The hotel has a very strange layout, because the elevators are in the middle of the hotel, and the furthest room from the elevators could be quite a walk. If you don't pay attention to the EXIT signs, you could find yourself all the way down the hall to a staircase. But once you get used to the layout, it's not too bad. Our room was clean, and the beds were comfortable. Pillows were very comforting. There is a coffee maker in the room, but I would suggest going down to the coffee shop down stairs. We stayed on the 8th floor overlooking the pool area, and each morning you could look down and there would be a word spelled out of towels on the chairs near the pool. My kids couldn't wait to see the word for the day. Overall, I would rate this hotel a great stay. Valet kind of ruined a 5 star for Service because they were slow in getting the car once we called down.

The Waldorf and Bonnet Creek properties are located side by side and share a series of convention venues linked with a common hallway. Although not sporting private cabanas like the Waldorf, I actually preferred the pool complex at the Hilton Bonnet Creek. It was larger, more kid friendly and had one of those Lazy River features that allow bathers to plop down on air mattresses and circumnavigate the complex every few minutes.

I came here for a business trip, but I brought my family along. Typically, it is not wise to mix business with pleasure, but the Hilton Bonnet Creek is perfect for both. I reserved a room for about $150, but upgraded to a 1200-foot suite on the 16th floor for only $80 per night more. I could not believe this room for the price --- 2 large, comfortable beds, an office, wet bar, large dining room with glass table, living room, 2 big-screen TVs, and 2 bathrooms. The beds are absolutely heavenly. The room is clean, the service is friendly and efficient, the food is great, and there are many options for dining and entertainment. This place is very clean and the staff is always working hard to keep it that way. The Harvest Bistro offers a great hot breakfast buffet for $20 per person (kids are free) with made-to-order omelettes and waffles along with many other items. Room service is fast, friendly, and offers a plentiful menu. The Harvest Bistro omelette is a must! I love the poolside beach-themed restaurant and bar where you can have frosty drinks and food delivered to your beach chair. At night there is a live DJ near the pool followed by a kids movie with popcorn. The location is about 4 miles from the Magic Kingdom and 2 miles from Downtown Disney. I've never been to a hotel that was perfect for business people and singles and families all at the same time. The hotel and staff are classy, but not stuffy. There are plenty of people walking around in business suits, and at the same time there are families in bathing gear heading for the pool. My only complaints (and very minor at that) are that you have to rent tubes for the kids ($5 per day) and wi-fi internet will set you back around $10 a day.

The poolside bar served up generously-portioned beachy drinks, and all the staff were really accommodating and friendly. The resort itself is right by Disney, and offers a free shuttle to the park. It was about a 20 minute drive to Harry Potter World and Universal Studios. Parking was $13 for self park, $20 for valet, and the internet cost extra. Everything was cleverly priced to get you upgrade, but what can you do, it's Orlando. I couldn't get too angry because the service was so good-- and there were smart extras, like free computers and printers by the front desk specifically for printing out your boarding pass.

We spent our last few days relaxing around the pool nibbling on complimentary frozen grapes. There is a pool area service as well as a place you can go and sit down to eat & drink if you prefer. Pool towels are also supplied FOC. If you are on holiday bear in mind that you will pay $13 per night for parking at the hotel (more for valet) and you will pay the same each day to park at Disney & Universal. Plenty of staff around the hotel who are always polite & smiling. Room service was great, the room was cleaned, tided and most importantly after a full day at the parks, the bed is made. The bed is so amazing I am in the process of receiving a quote to buy one and have it delivered to the UK. The hotel is easily located, just follow the signs for Downtown Disney and then head for Disney Caribbean. The hotel is actually inside the Disney resort. We could see Downtown Disney from our room and for $10 extra per night you could have a Disney park view, we saw this from the corridor window and could clearly make out Hollywood Tower of Terror and the tower in St.Marks Square, Italy in Epcot.", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville", "Title": "\u201cA destination in itself!\u201d", "Author": "1junior92", "ReviewID": "UR84349984", "Content": "My wife and I attended a conference at the Hilton Bonett Creek last week, and never left the property.

What a hotel! Let me start by saying that what we will remember most about this hotel is the lazy river. I had never before experienced a pool like it - the lazy river takes about ten minutes to carry you around the lovely pool area. It was great fun for big kids (meaning 40 somthings's). The pool is really easy to get in and out of with lots of entry points. Though this will be our lasting memory, overall this is a lovely hotel. It was one year old in October, 2010. It is a sharp well organised hotel - valet parking and luggage staff - excellent. Reception staff are helpful and interested. The rooms are well equipped. The bar is lovely for a drink or quick snack. We had a lovely meal at La Luce restaurant - great thoughtful food and terrific serving staff. However, you do need to book in plenty of time - which we did not realise and we were lucky to get in. The only alternative would have been the bar or the Harvest Bistro - and I was not sure that the Harvest Bistro would have had sufficient choices for dinner. Other useful points - there is a really handy 'Grab and Go' as you enter the Harvest Bistro - coffee, snacks etc. There is a great coffee shop (Muse) in the lobby which serves coffee and ice-cream. The pool area is well served with a good pool bar. The service around the pool is a little hit and miss - it could be improved upon. Having said that the food and the drinks, including virgin cocktails, were good and the staff were friendly, helpful and really terrific. I am slow to enthuse about hotels but this is a gem. The spa for the hotel is at the Waldorf which is right beside the Hilton.

This hotel is very pretty, great beds, great pool and quite close to Disney. I went with the Bonnet Creek to try something new, I have stayed on-property for most of my trips to Disney. The shuttle is not as convenient as staying on property, however it is not as crowded either. The bus is a luxury bus with cushioned seating and we were never crowded or had anyone standing. However, the bus only runs every hour and it stops at all the parks. For the Magic Kingdom, it drops you off at the bus transportation parking lot vs taking you to the Magic Kingdom parking lot. You have to walk to either the monorail or the boat to take you over to the Magic Kingdom. We found it very time consuming. If your main reason for vacationing in Florida is not to visit WDW each day, then this is a perfect hotel. The pool is fun, and it was never crowded. The weekend dive-in movies were interesting, they give you free popcorn (with goodies to add to it, like marshmallows, m&ms, etc) and you can either watch it from the pool or lounging on a pool-side chair. You can even order dinner while watching the movie. The rooms are about the same size as the moderate rooms at Disney, a tad bit smaller than the luxury at Disney. I am a Hilton honors member so I received 2 coupons for each day for a continental breakfast in the restaurant downstairs. We could pay $6 to upgrade the coupon to the full breakfast buffet. The buffet was wonderful! Everything you could want. The continental included everything cold in the buffet, so even the continental breakfast was wonderful! Can't go wrong there. All in all, the only issue we had was the shuttle service. There is no shuttle to/from the airport so you will have to pay for a Mears Shuttle or a cab/towncar. And to/from the parks is a little more time-consuming and they drop you off and pick you up further away that the regular Disney busses.

The hotel is part of the Bonnet Creek Resort, which is a 70-acre area located in the southeast corner of Walt Disney World. It is not owned by Disney, but is bordered on three sides by Disney owned land. The entrance is located just east of the entrance to Disney's Caribbean Beach Resort. The concept was to set up a cluster of luxury hotels. The hotel is next to the Astoria Hotel. In between these two is a conglomerate of convention space for any meeting, small or massive. Surrounding the hotels are beautiful grounds, pools, a gold course, lakes, water fountains, jogging track. It's architechtural marvelous but not pompous nor stark. The room is plush and large, with such comfortable beds, Serta Model Hilton Suite Dreams, which does not require a box spring. It is similar to the Conrad Chicgo - I bought from Seta directly the same bed. There is an empty refrigerator which can easily hold a case of beer. The water is instantly hot, the bathroom very nice. The room was so silent I could hear the digital clock ticking! Food was provided by the meeytings, which as prepared by Hilton. Very nice food. We ate one night at La Luce, whcih was excellent, but I don't know the cost. But tonight I just had the superb pork chop at the Harvest cafe restaurant. Yummy!

Great service, great beds and rooms= blissful sleep, and, of course, the beautiful pool. Free, and frequent, transport to Disney parks and Downtown Disney was great. A few tips if you're watching the pennies: 1. If you're going to the Parks, fill up on the $19 buffet breakfast - it will keep you going all day long. 2. Use the Muse cafe if you fancy a smaller breakfast or lunch - about $8 for a bagel and cappuccino, which you can eat on the balcony or at the poolside. 3. The only downside is that you're reliant on taxis/shuttles if you haven't got your own car - the black Towncars that operate from the hotel re about $5 more expensive than the yellow Mears cabs. Take a Towncar to your destination, but take a yellow cab back (there's plenty of them everywhere). 4. Beware drink prices!!! $6 for a small beer, $12 for a glass of wine. Tip- make use of your fridge and take a taxi to Walmart ($15-20 one way) to stock up on drinks. 5. The hotel doesn't provide transport to Universal or other non-Disney parks (including Disney waterparks). Cheapest way to get to Universal is to book at the hotel and it costs $18 per person for a round trip. We tried to use our initiative and find a cheaper way by taking a taxi to the Orlando Premium Outlet ($21), then catch the I-Trolley to the top of International Drive ($1.25 per person). The downsides of this is that its a long journey but ok if you want the experience of the Trolley. But by the time we'd used the Trolley there and back, and two taxi journeys, it actually cost us more than the normal shuttle, and was more tiresome. Other than that, enjoy this brilliant hotel!

The woman said that we had got our week for the price of two days hire. It was our first trip to Florida to do Disney. Some musts - do a schedule before you go and stick to it, don't do the big parks on the first day, do a water park so that it is a shorter day and you can ease in to the time difference, pace yourselves, it is impossible to go for the parks opening and staying till they close.

I guess we were lucky - based on other reviews on the matter - because we had a small refrigerator in the room. My key card didn't work - but SIgO's did, so no biggie. Paula at the front desk was so friendly, so helpful. She put us in a Disney view room at no additional charge (we were already on the Florida resident rate!). Every single employee we encountered at the hotel went above and beyond - and was incredibly friendly. The only exception was the gal bartender at the pool - she wasn't really rude, she just wasn't really friendly, either, and it was pretty clear she didn't want to be a work that day. She stood out given how nice and helpful everyone else was. For example, SigO is a big snorer and I had forgotten my earplugs. It was late (around midnight) and I asked the front desk if they might have any available. They checked around the hotel in various spots but couldn't find anything - so they offered to have a driver drive me to Walgreens. Wow. And the driver was a sweetheart too. Also, we walked over to the Waldorf (through the convention center) to see what it looked like one night. Unfortunately, our feet were hurting after a long day at the convention and I guess we must have mentioned it - because they said, heck, jump in the golf cart, we'll take you back. Wow. I know these are little things - but in a time when we are bombarded with bad service everywhere - these little things really stand out. We didn't get a chance to spend too much time in the pool area - a few hours - but it was beautiful and the lazy river was fun. Water temp, perfect, warm but still refreshing. We caught the end of a movie that they set up at night in the pool area - family oriented stuff. Cute. Didn't use it - but I noticed they had a very impressive fitness room - big with loads of new equipment.

We also had issues with the shower heads (or morning sprinkle). Had we spent more for the room ($119 p/n), I would have really taken issue with all of the extra charges. The other weird thing was the authorizing an extra $100 per/night (on top of room charges) for those using bank visa/mc debit card. It wasn't a problem for us, but for familes on a budget, if you don't know that ahead of time, this could really ruin some vacations. We are both well traveled, but this was our main observation...because you have both resort guests and business guests (there was a large sales convention), the whole experience wound up being impersonal and weird. It was odd to walk thru the extra large lobby in a bathing suit and our newly purchased floatee while dozens of conventioneers were drinking in business suits. That's where the identity issue comes into play. We did get the Disney view room with the pool view which was very nice. We also booked a package which included rounds of golf at the Waldorf Astoria. The course is amazing and the golf club staff was great...but there seemed to be a miscommunication between the Hilton and the golf club because the pro shop knew nothing about the Hilton package. However, it was a fun course to play. The golf club charges are on average with other places of that caliber ($30 pp TaylorMade club rental), ($7 for a beer on the course). Unless they reduce some of the fees, I wouldn't stay here for a leisure vacation. A business trip...maybe. Orlando has PLENTY of options where there aren't so many extra charges.

We spent 2 days at Universal and 2 days at Disney. While the hotel provides transportation to DIsney, it does not to Universal. When we tried to get the hotel to call us a cab (which is cheaper - $30 one way) they insisted we take on of their Mears private town cars (more expensive - $45 one way ) to Universal. They insisted that taxi cabs are \"unethical\" and when I asked how so, they weren't able to provide me an answer. Anyway, we scheduled the Mears shuttle ($18 per person ROUNDTRIP) the following day and didn't have a problem. The actual hotel has a great lazy river and pool area to be enjoyed from 6 am to 12 am. We were able to soak in the hot tubs before we'd go out for our long days at the park. The morning buffet was pretty good for $19 per person. The only cons I would say this hotel has is that they don't have taxis readily available to take you places and really push their private towncars; the showers also have very little water pressure.

I'd like to say. Forget about what all those idiots who complain about tiny things like the maid leaving their shoes next to their bed instead of moving them to the front door. Those people will never be satisfied by anything and always have a bad word to say. They really p*ss me off. This hotel is AMAZING. Immaculate and everything feels FRESH. Take MY advice. I've been to Florida 16 times since I was a kid, with my family. This was my first year without them and I travelled with my girlfriend. We are both students but we decided to seriously splash out because to us, holiday means luxury! We booked with florida4less. The coach transfer company, American Coach were rude and didn't have a clue what they were doing. They took us to the Wyndham,not realizing that we were at the Hilton and because of this error they picked us up late on our way back from the hotel to the airport.. So now.. To the hotel. The lobby is immaculate, the staff were all friendly although sometimes I felt like that was just because you held the cash and sometimes not genuine. They really couldn't do enough to make our stay more enjoyable! We got room service a few times and the Waiter whose name is 'Jose' was amazing. Really friendly guy he even brought us up some complimentary chocolate strawberries. The quality of the food in the room service is great. We ordered 2 pizzas not realizing that were HUGE and couldn't even finish half of each. I'd avoid their buffalo wings, they are awful. The toilet in our room was not holding pressure very well, which we'd noticed at the start of the holiday. It didn't bother us because it was just noise but on the last couple of days we phoned and asked for someone to take a look at it. They sat for about half an hour trying to fix it and as a result gave us a free movie on our second last night to enjoy! They didn't bother us at all. The rooms are spacious, the beds are AMAZING. Out of all the beds (I've stayed at disney resorts to marriot world centre, villas etc) these were the best. Matresses Not too soft but not too hard either. Now, a few tips: In all honesty, anyone going to Florida for disney or the parks NEEDS a fridge. It's essential. If you want to keep milk for cereal etc which we always do as it's cheaper to have our own breakfast then this is the only way. Same with bottled water. Infact we froze our water in the fridge so that it lasted through the heat of the day.Unfortunately, the hotel only has fridges on the top 2 floors, a MASSIVE flaw. What kind of 5 star hotel doesn't have fridges in all the rooms?! I arranged in advanced to have a fridge in my room for 'Medical' reasons and received this at no extra charge. As a result we got a room on the 17th floor, 2nd from the top. The view was superb, we could see all of downtown disney from our window. Another tip. I'm a computer geek, and I hate having to pay the ridiculous internet fees that hotels charge just so that I can check an e-mail or two. I believe that we're in an age where internet should be complimentary or at least dirt cheap. I connected to the Lobby wi-fi (complimentary) and tested the range of the router by walking back up to my room once I'd connected with the laptop still on. . They charge like 9 bucks a day. Anyway, once I got to the room I was happy to see that if you connect to the complimentary lobby service then you can enjoy the net for free in your room at no extra charge. It'll last for 24 hours but if you go and connect again once the time period is up, you can keep doing it. So we basically had free internet for 2 weeks. Great. Another amazing feature about the hotel was the pool. Beautiful pool! Nice and cool with a lovely poolside bar called 'Beech'. They served lovely food (espec the seasoned french fries mm!) I'm turning 20 this month but still managed to get a couple of cocktails served at the bar without Identification. They were LOVELY. The alcohol age is stupidly high in America. The only thing I could say about the pool is that it was too shallow (3ft in most parts) with the water underneath the two bridges being 4ft. OH AND the pool is open till midnight!! Which is GREAT. More hotels should do this. It gave us something to do in the evenings. The harvest bistro was lovely a nice place to pick up a pastry or something if you are in a rush before the parks. If you are going there for breakfast then ALWAYS get the buffet its 19 bucks but everything that's on the menu is in the buffet! + orange juice. Yeah it's a little bit overpriced but so are most places in Disney world. We didn't have a car. So we used the mears cabs mostly (those are the best to get, so many gypsy cabs about). You can order them at no cost from the concierge. This is the first year i've been to America without a car. It was a little bit more restricted but definitely manageable! The town cars are a complete rip-off. 47 bucks for a cab where someone sucks up to you. I recommend just getting the mears cabs to and fro if you need to. Cheap and cheerful. For the time of year the hotel was quite quiet. There weren't a lot of Annoying English guests boasting about the world cup, which was nice. Mostly Americans. When you're a British tourist surrounded by Americans in a hotel then it's usually a sign that the hotel is great. They know their service! Speaking of transport. The shuttle bus they had to the parks was excellent and was always on time if not a little early. All of the drivers with the exception of one were very nice and good to speak to. They put movies on the bus as well to travel from each point which was a nice touch. One of our drivers called 'Neville' was very rude. He never reciprocated a welcome. I don't think it was anything to do with a language barrier. More the fact that the guy was a moron. My reasoning behind this was that on our 3rd last night, we got the shuttle and it had to make a stop at epcot. Gradually, our air con turned off, then lights,then the whole engine of the bus. It was like something out of a scary movie. We had asked i the driver was okay but got no response. He never told the passengers what was wrong at all. One of the guests told him to stop restarting the engine (I think she was an engineer) because it could be very dangerous but he wouldn't listen. We sat there, with NO blinkers on so that other cars could see that we'd broken down. Luckily someone from the waldorf phoned the hotel immediately to fix the situation. The driver never apologised or said a word to the passengers right until the next bus had arrived to pick us up. The same guest who was offering him advice about the engine had asked for a stroller for her child which was under the bus. He wasn't even courteous enough to collect it for her after what she had done. We spoke to concierge and they had assured us that they would take care of the situation. To summarize the hotel was absolutely amazing, I think my family will go next year with me to this hotel if not then maybe the waldorf. Which by the way is amazing but the hiltons pool is much better. Guests are free to use both pools. I hope this has helped make up your mind! If you find a flaw that isn't a personal issue then you're an idiot. P.S forget all the 'This is a business hotel' garbage.

The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. I can't say the same about the staff at their restaurants or poolside though. Many times it took 15-20 minutes just to be acknowledged that we were customers that wanted to order something and they weren't even that busy. The bar in the lobby was a complete disaster. First, it took 25 minutes to get a beer and a White Russian. Second, the White Russian was terrible (all cream). Plus, our total bill for those two drinks was $20. Like many resort properties their restaurant prices are high. Cocktails are around $10 each, so plan accordingly if you want to drink at all. We had our towncar stop by the grocery store so we could pick up some beverages and snacks. Just ask for a complimentary fridge when you check in. The pool was by far the highlight. We spent two full days just lounging. You have access to the Waldorf and the Hilton pools, but the Hilton pool was better. It has a great lazy river! If you're planning on using tubes for the lazy river more than one day, I would purchase your tube for $7-$10. Otherwise, it's $5 per day to rent a tube.

This hotel is new, clean, bright and quiet. Its attached to the Waldorf so that hotel guest have access to both of the hotel's restruants and bars (there are something like 12 total open at different times). We always enjoy using the main lobby bar or Zeta bar when we get back from the park all day. Both places offer a good selection of drinks and also include food service till pretty late at night. Harvest down on the first floor puts on a nice breakfast and have a nice store for that late snack or quick breakfast bite. The poolside eatery offers good lunch menu and is open late if weather permits. Parking is the best, and honestly for the first time I have no issue being asked to pay for parking. Parking is in a well light, wide garage with a short covered walk to the hotel. The pool here is just amazing, a lazy river with zero entry pool and two hotubs is kid friendly but enjoyable for the older crowd. We often take just a day to use the pool and order lunch on the deck before going to a late dinner in downtown disney. Bus service is offered and its not bad, we elect to not use it on most cases as it is easier for us to drive to the parks and then dinner etc. But it is there, and included in the price, schedule is a tad inconvinent for us but thats to be expected at the non-disney resorts. The hotel does well to cater to families with movie nights in the pool and other activities during the day its really nice to see a resort actually be a resort for a change and plan activities etc. It is a buisness hotel but hilton has done well capturing both the buisness people and making this a family destination as well. Make note as with most hilton's internet is a paid service as well as parking. Some kids activities require a small fee (chargeable to the room) but alot of them are free as well.

We arrived early at check in and were told there were no rooms available - fair enough. The desk clerk took my number and said they would call me, which they did, although not until 16:30 which was slightly disappointing. The hotel is very new and as you would expect everything is in great shape. The rooms are fairly spacious, well decorated, and have nice modern bathrooms and a large flatscreen TV. However, as I mentioned, we booked this room (and paid extra) for the Disney fireworks view. You can technically see the fireworks from the room, but the room faces southwest, and the fireworks were in a northwest direction so they could only really be seen by pressing the side of our faces against the window and looking to the extreme right. This will be the same for pretty much everyone booking a similar room, as the ones on the other side of the building have no Disney view at all. That said, on the whole the view was good, overlooking the golf course and pool complex. Broadly speaking the location is excellent, right in the middle of Disney country and almost opposite Downtown Disney. There are shuttles to the parks and many other dining and entertainment options nearby. The biggest asset to this hotel is probably the pool. There is a zero entry \"beach\" style section, and a great lazy river. There is also a waterslide in a seperate pool. You can also take the walkway adjacent to the golf course to the sister property, the Waldorf Astoria. There are a few options for drinking and dining, from a coffee shop to a couple of more upmarket bars and restaurants. We ate buffet breakfast at the restaurant, which was great. An expansive collection of choices, all well prepared and presented. Overall, this is a good hotel. I really wanted to love it, and it has all the ingredients to be great, but there are a few minor issues that bothered me. Firstly, the parking was $12 per day - almost the same as parking in Disney. Once again, this seems like an easy way/excuse to generate some adidtional revenue out of being near to Disney. Internet access was not free - I know thats the case with most full service hotels but that doesn't make it right. If Hampton Inn and the like are giving free internet then why aren't Hilton? I was also a little disappointed by the front desk staff. This is purely a personal complaint but as a Hilton Honors Gold member this is the first hotel where I have really had to fight to get the amenities I was entitled to, and my enquiry about the availability of an upgrade was met with a shrug. This isn't a bad hotel. It's actually a good one, but I was left feeling that it really should be better...", "Date": "May 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa", "Title": "\u201cGreat Experience\u201d", "Author": "hymeragal", "ReviewID": "UR65204178", "Content": "Because we had such a great experience, I'm taking time to write a review. First of all, the place is HUGE but when you walk in, you're immediately greeted and made to feel at home. Although we arrived a bit early, our room was ready for us. We had spent a hot day at one of the theme parks and arrived a bit worse for the wear. Our room (and in fact, the entire hotel complex) is absolutely spotless. Honestly, we looked for flaws and couldn't find any! The bed was comfy and cozy. My spouse has back problems and was amazed to awake in the morning without pain. The food in the restaurants is a tad bit pricey but it is absolutely WONDERFUL! They have a hamburger in the Harvest Restaurant that's do die for and the fries aren't shabby either. In the evening we enjoyed sitting at the poolside bar. Speaking of the pool, wow. That's another story. It's the best hotel pool we've ever seen. There are two pools, one of which is made somewhat like a lagoon (I guess it's called zero entry). It would be great for little kids and old folks alike. There were a couple of hot tubs and a \"lazy river\" (current and all) that runs around the entire pool complex. There is also a large water slide on the property which empties into the little river. This hotel is a destination all on its own. If you're looking for a place to go and kick back between theme parks, this is your spot! There are nature walks and if you golf, a beautiful golf course. A family could easily spend a couple of days staying right on the property and never run out of activities. We came home and immediately headed to the calendar to find a date to go back. The only negative thing that I can find to say is who the heck picked the green paisley brocade jackets the front desk clerks must surely be forced to wear (sorry ladies, I hope I'm doing you a favor here)?

My husband and son enjoyed the golf course (a great course by the way - pristine condition) while I enjoyed the pool - the biggest complaint was the lack of space around the pool - the chairs were so jammed together that it was hard to get in and out if you weren't a young skinny thing! I was worried that the lazy river would be overrun with kids but really it was very pleasant even over the crowded Easter weekend. We ate twice at the wonderful Italian restaurant - fabulous service, great food and pretty good wine list. Only downside are the pillows associated with some of the seating- kind of awkward if too many wind up where you're sitting and the seats beside you are full -- you have no place to push the other pillows. Minor problem. Finally, the rooms - with our 6'2\" teenager we opted for the parlor suite and we would do this again in a heartbeat - my son had the parlor with it's own bath, a big plaxma tv, and a king sized pullout sofa that had the most unbelievable mattress - not the fold out couches of old! Our adjoining king was well appointed and a very comfortable bed for us as well. Instead of using the free buses to get to Disney (which were mobbed and seemed to be scheduled to stop at every park) we opted to use the car service available out front to take us to and from Epcot and to and from Downtown Disney that night for the Cirque show. SO much better than the bus and really very reasonable - in just minutes we were at our destination. We had our dirvers cell number and when we were ready to go back to the hotel all we had to do was call - Definitely the way to go!

The food was wonderful...and we attended two banquets on the property. For serving a couple of hundred people at a time, both times the food was tasty, hot and presented nicely..so kudos to the banquet and kitchen staff. I DID have an issue with our room. Granted, we arrived when most of our *group* had probably already checked in (it was busy at the reception desk, but we had a very short wait time ..this was addressed by another reviewer) and my husband wanted a room with a king sze bed. The only one left was a *handicapped accessible* room. After making SURE no one else *needed* that room ( we would have given it up without complaint if someone else needed that accommodation for their condition)..we were given that room. I was AMAZED the room we were given was SOSOSO far from the elevator!!! There WAS another handicapped accessible room closer to the elevator, to their credit...but the room we were given appeared to be more of an afterthought! I'm sure they have to have an accountable number of handicapped rooms, but I was appalled that they would put this room in the location it was in. We were 170 steps from the elevator (yes, I counted)...and if someone were on crutches, it would take them FOREVER to get to this room! Plus, there was NO view unless you were standing. It didn't bother my husband so much since he travels a lot, but if I (personally) were paying the amount they charge for a room, I would be almost in tears just overlooking the roof of the convention center! You could see some scenery in the far ground, but on a scale of 1-10, our view would have been about a 1 1/2. The room itself, I'm sure was decorated just as the others, and it was a nice room (and I realize when you are on vacation, you don't just go to stay in the room itself). Because of the status of the room, the bathroom had extra moving around space and extra balance bars. The flat screen tv was nice to have also. We had breakfast at the \"Harvest Bistro\"...$19 for breakfast buffet. OUCH! We didn't eat at any of the other hotel restaurants. We did pay for the internet, which bugs my husband to no end, since the rooms are pricey. We had rented a car also, so we did the self parking, which was another expense. (As per other reviews, we didn't have any GPS problems finding the hotel...it may have been updated since other reviewers had written their reviews). We took advantage of the pool and lazy river during some down time, and it was very relaxing, so that was a definite plus...our kids would have loved it.

I have mixed feelings about the $13 parking fee but if you're only there for 1 night, no big deal. Any longer than that, it's a problem. I understand this is a resort but charging for parking when there is nothing else in the immediate vicinity is a little ridiculous. Hotel lobby was beautiful and we didn't have any issue checking in.

The hotel begins speaking for itself as you approach, and view its pristine landscape. You catch a glimpse of the pool area and as if by cue, your companions begin fantansizing with the notion of lounging in the sun with a cool beverage and the sound the lazy river gently carressing their minds. Your journey would take you first to the grand entrance lobby after you have been greeted by a myriad of helpful bell staff prior to going in. Once inside, you will immediately decide that if by some quirk of fate, you would live here forever. The front desk personnel greet you as if they had known you since birth. They provide all the information that you may need for your stay, thus eliminating your need to make any decision other than what bathing suit you plan to put on first, before finding that perfect spot poolside. Ahhh, poolside...now here is maybe the only dilemma that you may face during your stay. Should I choose a place near the beverage and snack bar or should I be over near the zero entry point for the lazy river? Regardless, wherever you find yourself, that is where you will want to be. The efficient pool area wait-staff will go above and beyond your expectations in making your place in the sun, the paradise you imagined. Now if you happen to be lucky enough to have your children with you, a word of caution. You may not be able to get them out of the lazy river, ever! My daughter went in at 3:15 PM one Saturday afternoon, and it wasn't until 10:30 PM that evening that I was able to convince her that she needed to get out. If you have a water-baby like I do, then be prepared. The variety of food choices at the pool area bar can satisfy all tastes for adults and children, so there really is never a need to leave until bedtime anyway. There also are plenty of activities planned to keep your children occupied throughout the day, so a day of pure relaxation for mom and dad is definitely within their grasp. They had a \"Dive-In\" movie in the evening that was very entertaining for my daughter and me. When it was finally time to retire for the evening, (after an incredible amount of coaxing on my part), it was clear to see that no expense was spared to provide you with a sleeping experience that would recharge your batteries for yet another day by the pool or visiting any one of the nearby theme parks, none of which were more than 20 minutes away. (We're talking Disney World and Downtown Disney, Sea World, and Universal Studios.) My room was well appointed with all the conveniences you would expect from a Hilton property, from a state-of-the-art television to computer hook-up with high-speed internet access. And the bed!!!! Definitely no expense spared in that department. The staff you encounter in all aspects of the hotel go out of their way to make your stay as wonderful of an experience as possible.

Lets start with the good aspects of the hotel - its absolutely beautiful, the rooms are spacious, very clean, the staff is friendly, the conference rooms are stunning and the pool is by far the best feature. The pool offers two hot tubs, a lazy river and even a slide for the kids. Now for the bad part - I mentioned the staff is very friendly but its also important for the staff to get certain things accomplished. For example, we had some food that needed to be refrigerated so we ordered a fridge up to our room. We waited for about 5 hours and were told repeated amount of times that it was on its way. Well the fridge never came and we found out we were 12th on the list to receive a fridge. It would be nice to know that ahead of time so we could make other arrangements! Transportation & restaurants - since we worked late on night we thought it would be a good idea to stay in the hotel for dinner, unfortunately the wait to get seated was two hours. A little frustrated we decided to ask the concierge what our options for dinner were - we waited for a good 5 minutes before she acknowledge us only to find out that she didn't know much about the area. She suggested downtown Disney but couldn't made any of the restaurants. We decided to give it a shot but we had issues with the transportation because we didn't have a car on the property. She suggested we take the town car into Disney and call the number of the hotel after dinner to arrange pickup. Well than we waited another 30 min for a town car to show up. After dinner we called the number provided only to find out it was a wrong number, we called the hotel, they told us the town cars are privately run and won't be able to pick us up for another 30-1 hour. (We were told it would take 10 min) I could go on and on about this but basically the information we were given was very poor, total miscommunication on the hotels part. The last part (and I can't even believe I am frustrated about this but I think it was just topping on the cake) I decided to put \"do not disturb\" on my door because I didn't want my room cleaned. I left a lot of personal items out and since we were only staying there two nights I didn't need the room service. I came back from my all day conference to find my room cleaned and my personal items organized. If I would have known or wanted my room cleaned I would have said so and put away all my valuables. Overall, the hotel is expensive and the service that was provided was very poor. I would not recommend this hotel. Yes, its beautiful but not worth it.

Rooms were large with 2 queen beds easily accomodating 2 adults and 2 kids. Hotel is only 6 months old so everything is brand new. Shuttle service was efficient with 2 buses an hour to Magic Kingdom. The shuttle also services the other Disney Parks but not Universal. It does not cover the water parks so we took the car. The hotel can get busy and people arriving after 9.30 had to wait an hour for breakfast. Best to get up and go put your name down on the breakfast queue. You can then come back later. Probably best to grab a sunlounger early as there aren't enough umbrellas. Couldn't understand why they didn't have enough umbrellas as they haven't spared any expense elsewhere in this hotel. The gym was more than adequate with plent of CV equipment. Swimming Pool was ok with a lazy river around the outside and a slide for kids. They charge $5 a day to hire an inflatable ring. If you want you can buy a ring from one of the gift stores for $5. Drinks, lunch and dinner is pricey at the hotel but there are plenty of options to eat out if you have a car. The hotel is located close to all the Disney parks.

Now, if you're like me, and hearing Mickey Mouse's voice on the buses and in the stores really makes your skin crawl, then staying at the Hilton Bonnet Creek is a great alternative to staying on Disney property. The location is great, because you feel like you're on Disney property, but you're not actually part of it. The only thing that gives that away are the shuttles - they are timed, and not official Disney shuttles, which as I mentioned earlier - I can really do without. My stay was part business, and part vacation, so in terms of business and leisure hotel, this property is great. The room was large and comfortable, and they had a great deal for in room internet (3 days at $19.99), which I think any business traveler can appreciate. You also had a choice of wireless or plugging in the ethernet cable like the old days. While, I did not have a view of the property or Disney, I was very comfortable, and ordered room service two nights while I stayed in my room to work. The food was exceptional, and the room service staff was helpful and friendly. I also made it to the gym on property two of the 3 nights I stayed there, and found the gym very adequate, and enjoyable since it was very sunny, and all of the equipment was brand new. There is also a running trail that i took advantage of one evening that takes you around to their sister property, The Waldorf Astoria. Unfortunately, I didn't get any time by the pool, but I could see that everyone was enjoying themselves either in the lazy river, or at the pool bar. All of the kids seemed like they enjoyed themselves as well. The weather was amazing the week I was there, so overall this Orlando experience was top notch. The only drawback I had was with the valet parking. It was $21 dollars a day, and it was $14 for self park. The self parking area was nowhere to be found, so you really didn't want to self park - some signage would have been nice giving guests an option. The parking staff seemed inconsistent, and it took over 10 minutes to bring my car around on a few occasions. I also saw a few people arguing with the valet staff two out of the three days, because they were not aware of the price difference for valet parking. They should really have some signage, or require the parking agents to hand each guest a piece of paper that they can initial, so that they know exactly what the difference is. I would stay at this property again. I would also recommend it to people who don't really want all of the Disney \"brainwashing\" for their entire stay.

Smack in the middle of the Disney resort without all of the Disney commotion. Great spot. (Not the most convenient bus schedule to the parks though. I would suggest you just drive yourself.) The property itself was gorgeous, exactly what you would expect from a brand new Hilton. Lovely lobby, comfortable bar area, fantastic outdoor seating overlooking the pool. Loved the multi-era pop music that was always playing in the background. Really nice atmosphere. The pool is perfect for families with kids of all ages. Nice kiddie pool, huge zero depth entry pool and a great lazy river with fun water spouts all around. Plenty of chairs and a fantastic one hour only hold policy on pool chairs. The room was fine. The mini fridge froze all of the food and drinks, but we didn't bother to ask for a new one (there was no adjustment dial). I can only assume they would have fixed it if we had asked. A small annoyance was the makeup/shaving mirror in the bathroom It was on the counter so you either had to hunch over it to use it or bring a chair in and sit at the counter. It should be on a shelf or mounted on the wall. Awesome view of the Disney parks, fireworks and sunset if you get a Disney view room. I loved the recycle bins everywhere, including in the rooms ... way to go Hilton! While the staff was very friendly it was painfully obvious this hotel is completely understaffed when it's at high occupancy. The service was really terrible. The first few days we were there it was quiet and service was just ok, but then the spring break crowd hit and service became non-existant. I won't go into every little detail, but I will say it really diminished what would have been a great stay. Getting drinks or food poolside was impossible. There was ONE server waiting on the entire pool area! And while he was friendly and doing his best to accommodate, he was clearly inexperienced and in way over his head. We ended up walking to the bar to order our own drinks and food. Not only didn't we feel pampered (as we were hoping), but we felt like we were at home. Annoying and disappointing. The wait for the (one) breakfast restaurant was up to an hour and forty five minutes by Sunday morning. There were empty tables all over, but no staff to re-set them. (Kudos to the kitchen staff though ... the buffet was always well-stocked and clean.) The lobby bar seemed to only have one server also and she REALLY didn't have any experience. She didn't know the wines or basic cocktails and got that deer in the headlights look when I asked her about the menu. I had to ask her back to the table three times before she got our (two drinks) order correct. The bartenders seemed to be very inexperienced also. I actually saw one of the bartenders pouring the wines together into one bottle to make more room on the shelf. So unprofessional. Another annoyance was the \"nickel and diming\". The parking rates were just ridiculous. I know this is becoming the norm at most hotels, but really ... we weren't in Manhattan. Also, five dollars a day per tube for the lazy river?? Is that really necessary? We requested a late check out and were quoted twenty five dollars an hour for it. All of the little charges just began to grate on my nerves. To end on a positive note I will say LaLuce was the best restaurant we went to the entire week. While the old Disney standards (California Grill, Citricos and The Flying Fish Cafe) were absolutely not as good as they used to be this place was perfection. Our server (Stephanie) tolerated and accomodated our two tired children with absolute professionalism. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and (the great)wine list. The food was outstanding!. Hands down the best restaurant we've been to, on vacation or otherwise, in a long time.

In fact, at times it was a little crazy with kids and families everywhere.

As noted by others, its location to Disney makes it easy for a family to stay here while mom or dad are attending a meeting. The hotel property is very nice, with an adjacent golf course and areas to get out and walk or run safely. The Hilton's pool is large and attractive, 3 separate swimming areas are all connected by a \"river\" that you can float down; there is actually a small current to propel you. It is busy and noisy though, at least in season. If you want a quieter experience, walk on over to the adjacent Waldorf property instead, where the pool area is slightly more formal, and more adult oriented. The service I encountered was all uniformly excellent. A short line at check-in was improved with the presence of a staff person greeting each guest and carrying on a short conversation while you waited -- nice touch. The rooms are somewhat small, particularly the bathroom, but offer standard amenities. The walk-in shower was very nice but a challenge to get into due to the tight fit between the shower door and toilet. My room on the 3rd floor didn't offer much for views, but was quiet except for hearing hallway conversations. Wireless internet was fast and reliable ($). Furnishings and work desk were comfortable. I ate most of my meals at conference functions, but did have dinner one night in the upscale Luce restaurant. I had a pizza from their brick oven that was excellent. Room service is available 24/7.

We were participating in a convention with over 800 delegates. The convention was held at the Conference Centre located between both the Hilton and the adjoining Waldorf Astoria. Firstly, I'd like to say that the location of the resort is fantastic. It is located with two miles of most Disney attractions; many of which could be viewed from my 15th floor hotel bedroom window. This is a real bonus if you're travelling with your family. The resort is brand spanking new and the outdoor pool looks good and well maintained. The rooms were modern and well equipped. There is no spa at the hotel (you'll need to walk to the Waldorf to indulge yourself) but the gym is well-equipped and modern. The outdoor \"running track\" is no more than a path that runs between this and the Waldorf. I found the neverending 'muzak' that is pumped through speakers along the path to be a little irritating. What is wrong with a little peace and quiet?! The golf course looks fantastic but I didn't get the opportunity to play it. There is adequate parking in the multi-storey facility adjacent to the hotel. Between the Hilton and the Waldorf there is a fine selection of restaurants and bars. The lobby bar at the Hilton was where we congregated most. The Hilton Italian restaurant is very good, as was the 'Bull and Bear' in the Waldorf. Most, if not all, purchases can be charged back to your room from either hotel so it makes shopping and eating relatively painful. The only disappointing thing we found was the organisation at breakfast when there is a convention or conventions (as in our case) going on at the hotel. Breakfast is held in a restaurant on the Ground Floor and the choice of food is great. Service could be a little slow but the waiting times could be horrendous. I would suggest booking a table for breakfast if you find that there is a conference going on at the hotel during your stay. Many of my colleagues were not getting seated, due to the waiting times, until 0945-1000am! That is more than a little unacceptable. And that really sums up the hotel and its facilities. It's all very shiny and new, but it doesn't do anything particularly spectacularly. It does just enough, whilst the Walforf next door seems to add that little bit more glitz and style.

The hotel is just a couple miles from the parks and runs a regular, convenient and very clean full size shuttle bus which made it easy. \"Wow\", was all we could say when we walked into this brand new (5 months at our stay) hotel. Especially when we were only paying $130/ night. I was worried the rate was too good to be true, but this hotel and its property is as nice as some $250 + hotels. Being new, needless to say, cleanliness was superb. Brand new carpet, brand new beds, brand new HD television in room, brand new pool-what else could you want? And staff was enthusiastic to please. I find it hard to describe how lovely the hotel and property were. Stunning. Any glossy web photos you see of it are 100% accurate. If here just for Disney, you do not need a rental car. If doing it again, I would skip the rental, taxi from the airport (or maybe the hotel has a shuttle-didn't check since we rented a car), and use the savings on car rental and the $13 hotel parking to eat at the hotel restaurants, which are very good, if a fair bit more than eating off site. And off-site is quite a distance, as there is really nothing between this hotel and Disney except other hotels, which was its' only downside, and I even hate to call it that. This hotel has a gorgeous, magazine-photo quality pool. This Hilton is also attached to the Waldorf Astoria by way of a conference centre, so taking an indoor stroll makes you feel like royalty as you walk past Barbara Barry inspired furniture and decor. The halls seem to go on for miles, so we never really felt the need to leave the property, except to get our money's worth from the car rental. In truth, as fun as Disney was, we couldn't wait to get back to this beautiful hotel at the end of the day. You must take your family here! A couple trendy lounges also make for a nice adult stay as well.

I liked the website, so I checked out the rates. I couldn't believe how reasonable they were. This hotel is very new and large, so I'm thinking that's why the rates are so good.

If you have trouble walking or children that don't enjoy walking, I'd suggest asking for a room close to the elevators. We requested a room on a high floor with a Disney view, which was nice. It overlooked the pool, golf course, and had a view of Disney. We could actually see the fireworks at night from our room. The only downside was that the room was far away from the elevators. The room itself was spotless. Everything looked fresh and new. The sheets were bright white. The beds were comfortable and new. The towels were also bright white and soft. There was plenty of lighting, etc. The restaurant choices in the hotel were interesting. The casual cafe was very good. It served breakfast and lunch. We ate the breakfast buffet ($20 per person). They had a nice assortment of food and made to order foods such as an omelet station and a waffle station. The Italian restaurant was opened for lunch and dinner. It always seemed crowded there, so I'd suggest making a reservation ahead of time. Personally, my family and I found it odd that such a large hotel would have such limited restaurant choices. The hotel suggests that you go next door (about a 1/2 mile away) and eat at one of the Waldorf's restaurants. None of us brought clothes that we felt were appropriate for the Waldorf. Plus, we didn't want to spend too much time eating at either hotel. While there was an in room dining menu, it was very limited. We noticed that some people ordered take out food and had it delivered to the lobby. While the hotel was located off the main path, it 's beautiful and peaceful. The pool was spectacular with the lazy river. It was enjoyable for adults as well as children. My family and I really enjoyed our stay. As long as you have a rental car, you can commute to almost any Disney attraction or local restaurant within about 5-10 miles. It was a great deal for the money.

I had the pleasure of going there the second month it opened through priceline (name your own price). Most hotels treat you differently when you book with a third party, they did not here. All my requests were met with big smiles. That said, my second time around I decided to secure that I would stay at Bonnet Creek and booked directly with the hotel. We got the winter escape package that had free breakfast at Harvest Bistro. Seriously, it's soo good and we ate so much and stayed full all day! We didn't eat again until dinner time where we had apps and cocktails at the Peacock Lounge in neighboring hotel Waldorf Astoria. This looks like a great hotel and they even had cucumber water. Something that reminded me of our honeymoon to Jamaica. It was a very nice touch. The walks between the hotel can be inside or out. Since the weather was bad, we walked past giant ballrooms and warm decor. This hotel is made for weddings and events too, but in between hotels so guests not involved will not be bothered. Our room was very comfortable with lots of space. Little fact, there is a table that rolls out from under your desk. We used this when we got room service and takeout. There is still no refrigerators, but being new I assume that they're probably still working on that. We didn't really miss it. The gem of this hotel is the pool which overlooks the beautiful golf course. Who needs a water park when you have a lazy river and slide?! I am 26, but played like I was 12!! It did rain the whole weekend except for Sunday (of course), but when I requested a late checkout so that we could use the pool the staff completely understood and let us.

Prices have risen drastically since then at most on property resorts, sending us off the mainstream in efforts to keep visits affordable. Thus it was refreshing to find this new sparkling (and I mean brand spanking new) resort in Disney by Hilton at the Bonnet Creek area. Nestled near the Caribbean Beach and Typhoon Lagoon, it is a simple drive away from Downtown Disney or any theme park, or using the hotels free transportation. Everything about the property is new, and what a refreshing feeling that is. The room's beds are ultra comfortable, and room quiet to boot. The bathroom had a large stand up shower, and the large flat screen TV across from the bed was fantastic. Two downsides were A. the parking charge. Disney resorts do not, yet Hilton does, so figure that into the cost 'savings' of the room. B. Crowding at the breakfast restaurant. I had to wait about 15 - 20 minutes for a seat, and they were indeed moving tables. I had a free continental breakfast coupon, which the server saw and collected, however then attempted to charge me for a full breakfast anyways. It was corrected upon request, however a service recovery would be to skip the charge all together (about 6$ to upgrade from continental to hot brekkie).

Others have commented on the nickel-and-diming, which only struck me as egregious when I paid $1/minute for brief internet access. The spa is in the adjoining Waldorf. While we rolled with its 5* prices, I think many guests would gag. The 24hr \"snack bar\" stocks only drinks and pastries, so if you get home late or want a midnight snack, you have no choice but to order room service. The bars close or stop serving food well before 12:00. Many reviewers have mentioned the surprising lack of a refrigerator, which means that you can't even plan ahead. My biggest thumbs down goes to the admittedly personable concierge. After a lengthy discussion of area restaurants, he assured us that Christini's was the place to go for a money-no-object meal. Shame on us for not checking here. If we had, we'd know that a)you shouldn't go to Christini's; and b)the business card he asked us to give to the maitre d' likely served no purpose other than to supplement the former's pay. I hate to make that accusation, but the service, food, and wine were all atrocious for the price. We later learned of several restaurants that are far, far superior. So why do I still rate it a 4/5? We paid $100/night via Priceline. At that rate, these faults are more than tolerable. In fact, it felt like a steal. But at $220+/night, man...I would not return for the night.

Now if we were at the Animal Kingdom Lodge there would of been a lot more things to do with the kids (animal viewing to structured kids activities at the hotel). We could of made it a cool experience for the kids even without leaving the hotel. At the Hilton we were really limited to the pool (it was heated on the Hilton side and the kids did go into it and liked it....I dont think the Animal Kingdom's pool is heated so give a check mark to the Hilton). If you look at the normal rates for a family of four then you can easily say that the Hilton can save your family some cash while still staying at a very nice and new hotel that happens to have transportation directly to the Disney Parks.

We were staying on Hilton Honors points and my husband is a Gold VIP member. We had a king bed room booked. Upon arrival we were told that the king beds were not available but they upgraded us to a suite to compensate. We were pleasantly suprised at our accomodations. Two rooms, two bathrooms, dining room table for 8, a living room, wet bar and study area and a view of Disney in which we watched the Illumination fireworks at Epcot from our window. Although we did have 2 queen beds, they were extraordinarily comfortable and we slept soundly. Only critique of these amazing accomodations were that there was NO refrigerator, not even in the wet bar area. A sink, two coffe makers, but no fridge. The pool looked amazing, but as the weather was in the 30's, we did not use it. The staff however did fold some towels in the shape of I LOVE YOU XOXO out on the lawn chairs on Valentines day and handed out individually wrapped heart shaped cookies in the lobby. Nice touch. Actually did not mind paying the fee for the parking garage. We expected it coming in, so were not suprised by it. However we did not like the fact that the parking garage was only accessible via an outside covered walkway. This made for a cold dash to the hotel with our suitcases. On our first night, instead of paying room service to deliver, we went to La Luce and tried to order our meal take out. They would only allow us to order pizza to go as they said that much of their food would not travel well and the presentation was important. We did order two personal sized pizzas and went to the coffee shop for a salad and two sodas. This cost us $70. We also ate breakfast in the Harvest Bistro on two occassions. The first was excellent. The second was not. After a 30 minute wait (we were told 10 min), there was a coffee pot at entrance, we asked to get a cup while we waited and were told that it was just for refills for people leaving the restaurant. A manager finally brought out 5 plastic cups for about 30 people in the lobby waiting to be seated. Upon being seated we ordered our drinks and went to the buffet for breakfast. Although our breakfast was complimentary with HHonors, we upgraded for $6 each to the full hot buffet. Of the four hot items on the buffet, three of them were empty, so after 15 more minutes the french toast was refilled. At this point there was a line waiting for it. (it was very good once we got it) But upon arrival back at the table, our waiter had still not brought us coffee. We were finished eating and paying the check when he brought out a carafe of coffee. This was a Sunday around 9:45am, so although a peak time for breakfast, the service could have been better. No excuses for a hotel of this caliber.

The hotel is very nice. This is a new hotel so I'm going to cut them a little slack on a few things. THINGS WE REALLY LIKED ABOUT THIS HOTEL: There are two elevator bays; one bay for lower floors and one bay for upper floors. We stayed on the 14th floor and never had to stop for the lower rooms on the way down, which is really smart of some engineer/designer. GOOD JOB HILTON! The rooms are comfortable, and so are the beds. The showers are nice with Kohler fixtures which gives a nice gentle shower. Our room was correctly temperature controlled and has a safe in the nightstand (a must have). There is a coffee maker in the room, which is nice, but to be honest, the brand of coffee used does not make the best coffee I've ever had (or even close for that matter). Very nice wide-screen television. SECURITY: O.K. I'm a security professional so I may be a bit tougher than some in my review of this area. The clothed security members were a dark blazer and look very good. They were visibly present during the day and evening, although I did not see any security at 4:00 am on the day we left the hotel. I did see security in the hallway of the 14th floor on two occasions, which is very good because the hallways are long and there do not appear to be any type of video monitoring in these areas. Very nice pool area and two nice hot tubs. There is a snackbar at the poolside. The elevators go all the way to the pool and fitness club level so you don't have to walk through the lobby in your swimwear (nice planning). Nice large towels at the pool, and the chairs by the pool are very nice (yes, they are good for large people too!) The fitness club is nice with state of the art machines, towels, water, etc. My wife used the fitness club and enjoyed it. THINGS WE DID NOT LIKE ABOUT THIS HOTEL: THE BIGGER AREA OF SECURITY CONCERNS FOR ANYBODY STAYING AT THIS HOTEL IS THE PARKING GARAGE/RAMP. OTHER THAN THE CAMERAS WHICH ARE AT THE VEHICLE ENTRY, THERE DO NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY CAMERAS IN THE PARKING GARAGE. WE NEVER SAW ANY SECURITY PEOPLE IN THIS AREA. I WOULD RECOMMEND USING THE HOTEL VALET SERVICE IF YOU ARE TRAVELING ALONE. The Hilton security staff need to improve on this area of this fine hotel. The parking garage gates did not always work with our room key/card. There was a button on the key box that we pushed and we were immediately assisted via speakerphone. Parking will cost you $13.00 per day plus tax, which totals $13.85/day. This charge is in addition to your room charge. The hotel will sell you a USA TODAY newspaper for $.75/day. The hotel will automatically deliver this to your door and charge you for it unless you call and cancel the paper delivery. The prices for food are crazy unreasonable. Want room service for breakfast? Here's what you'll pay: Continental Breakfast - $ 19.00 + 22% Gratuity and service charge +State & Local tax + $3.00 in-room dining charge. 2 eggs, bacon, ham & potatoes - $ 17.00 + 22% Gratuity and service charge +State & Local tax + $3.00 in-room dining charge. O.J., Granola-yogurt parfait, raisin bran muffin, coffee or tea - $ 18.00 + 22% Gratuity and service charge +State & Local tax + $3.00 in-room dining charge. Coffee - $ 6.00 + 22% Gratuity and service charge +State & Local tax + $3.00 in-room dining charge. Juice - $ 5.00 + 22% Gratuity and service charge +State & Local tax + $3.00 in-room dining charge.

With that said... my stay at the new Hilton Bonnet Creek was not among my best experience with hotels. I've NEVER had a bad experience with any of my hotel stays anywhere (and I've been to plenty of places, especially in Orlando). I reserved and put a deposit down for a King Disney View room. Upon check in they did not have any Disney King Views open just a Queen Disney View and with little thought I agreed to it. I went into the room and shortly after realized that a queen bed is not what we wanted. We call guest services and requested another King room with a view of the golf course or conservation (we obviously booked a Disney view because we wanted a view of something nice vs. a parking lot). The guest services representative moved our room to a room with a view of a wall (top wall of their convention center) LITERALLY JUST A WALL. So I called again and kept my cool and requested another room with ample apologies we were promised a golf course view room and were put in a view of the front parking lot on the 4th floor. WOW! C'mon so we called again this time a bit angry and explained the situation and we were passed on to a manager who at first was defensive but later eased up to our concern. She had a bellman come to our room and move our stuff to the appropriate room and delivered our room keys. This room was a pool view (again not a golf course view as she even told us we would get) but their pool is pretty and is better than the previous failed attempts. By the way I was willing to pay for the view and even though about just having her transfer my reservation to the Waldorf next door if they messed up again. No call to follow up and make sure all was okay. So we took the room happily after a 2 hour mess of trying to get a room without the view of a wall. The amenities were nice. It was too cold for the pool but I bet if it were warmer out it would of been nice. The location is great. However, I would not stay again. It's sad to officially say I had my first horrible hotel experience at a hotel that I would of never guessed gave this kind of service.

They made everything fresh to order. Nice staff. The HBC is about as good as it gets. I don't see how anyone can say anything negative. If they do, there is no hotel that will ever satify them. Please check out this hotel.

We ate breakfast at the hotel's Harvest Bistro every morning. It was BEST breakfast buffet ever! We're a vegetarian family so they had alot of choices for us. Hot Oatmeal with toppings, fresh fruit, yogurt parfaits, mini smoothies, cheeses, breakfast breads, some other hot items such as breakfast burritos, potatoes etc. We had dinner only once and its was good. We also had room service one day and my kids loved the room service pizza. We also got some french fries which were certainly not the average fried potatoes. They were seasoned with rosemary. Delicious. Since our kids were with us we didn't venture into the more formal restaurants on property. The kids loved the pool. There is kiddie pool, a waterslide, lazy river and couple of hot tubs. we didn't use the the hot tubs but the kiddie pool and lazy river were nice. The bus service is very good, atleast for Magic Kingdom which is the only park we visited. Its a \"luxury\" bus with plush seats. Very comfortable ride. The bus runs are scheduled with last pickup being 50 mins after park closing. We took a taxi back to hotel on one night and it was $20 including tip. Overall it was a great stay. My kids loved the hotel. The lobby and outer areas are inviting. The staff always greeted us warmly and was generally appeared to eager to please.

The Italian restaurant La Luce is exceptional on any scale: Food (selection and preparation): great. Decor: super: service: exceptional. We ate there two nights out of our seven.

I understand there are about 1000 rooms & suites in the hotel. This is a very nice Hilton. Bonnet Creek has a very open and inviting lobby. While it is a convention hotel, I was not there for a convention so I can write about the hotel as a private guest who experienced the hotel and yet got to see others holding their convention there. The concierce is located right in the heart of the lobby as is one of the hotel bars. This HIlton has an amazing pool area which looks like a winding lazy river complete with waterfalls and water tubes for the kids. It is a zero entry type pool complete with inner tubes should you want to float on one. A hot tub also is onsite in the expansive pool area. This is sunbathers heaven in season I imagine. There is also a very nice work out area and a pricey spa. Bonnet Creek also has a most intriguing series of restaraunts. The Italian restaraunt La Luce is amazingly good and features world class chef Donna Scala. In total, there are 12 restaraunts and bars. Self Parking is about $14 with valet being $20. You will pay for Internet in your room If a convention bring you to this hotel, note there is a indoor and outdoor supervised Kid's Club on site to keep the little ones entertained. Epcot is the closest park at about 1/2 mile away but this hotel is really kind of in it's own area.

The rooms were nicely decorated and we had a fantastic view of Disney - we could see the fireworks at night. The gym was also excellent. I also liked how it was on Disney property- I didn't really realize that before we stayed here- they had a free shuttle to the parks and it was an easy $8 cab ride when we grabbed a cab back after a late movie in Downtown Disney.

I can tell you that this is a MUCH MUCH MUCH nicer hotel than the other Hilton on Disney property. Not even comparable, really. The concierge was also really nice and helpful. The negatives: -Housekeeping staff was not great. They kept knocking lightly and then walking right in with their key cards. Once they came in while my mother was sleeping. Granted, we didn't have do not disturb signs on the door, but it would have been nice if they had made more of an effort to make sure no one was in the room before walking in, especially after it had already happened a few times. The really annoying part was when I felt like staying back at the hotel for the day to relax but wanted the room cleaned. After my mother had been barged in on two hours earlier, I called down to ask if they could come back to clean while I went out to the pool. The operator assured me they'd be right up. I came back after an hour and the room had not been touched. I had to call down again and go back down again for 45 minutes while they came back to clean. If the weather was better it would have been a non issue, but it wasn't a ton of fun to hang out at the pool in 60 degree weather. -My mother really wanted to know who the artist was who painted the paintings in the lobby. She asked the front desk staff on three different occasions and everyone kept passing the buck around and telling her to ask other people. It was kind of annoying. -Tried to eat lunch at the pool and tons of birds kept trying to eat my food.
