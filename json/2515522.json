Location was excellent - on the outskirts of the city but within a 10 minute drive to most attractions and the airport. Staff were very friendly. The hotel was recently redone so everything in the room was new and clean. I was surprised to see granite not only in the bathroom but also on the bedside table, desk and TV stand. Few minor fixes still being done but 99.9% finished and I could live without a toilet roll holder. The beds were comfortable with three pillows on queen size beds. The free breakfast was excellent and included scrabbled eggs, fresh waffles, bacon/sausage, rolls, toast, danish, cereals, juices, coffee & tea. The breakfast area was kept clean and daily newspapers available. There was a very cheerful lady who kept the food well stocked and offered assistance to the guests. The only downside was the parking area had small parking spots but I was still able to get my larger rental car in. There are two parking lots so if one is full go to the other side of the hotel for more. Alternatively there are spots on the street. Parking is free. Rollaways available for a $10 charge; not the most comfortable but typical of rollaways.

The Old Town location was closer, but much more expensive (especially with the $10 parking fee they charge there). I thought I'd give Mission Bay a try. Michael was at the front desk when I arrived. He asked how my day was going, and I was honest: I was just really frazzled, and also worried I'd maxed-out the only credit card I'd brought with me! I didn't -- it went through, yay! -- and Michael just went out of his way to listen and set me up in a room where I could get my work done. I forgot to get the name of the man at the desk when I checked out, but he was equally accommodating. I was WAY late checking out \u2014 I'd asked for a 1 p.m. late checkout, but I really didn't get out of there until 2 p.m., due to traffic and my event ending late. No one gave me any trouble about it. My room key had expired, but the desk clerk renewed it so I could get my stuff, and even take a shower before I left. I was impressed. La Quinta staff just go above and beyond every single time, and that's the primary reason I never hesitate to pick this chain over all the other dog-friendly and affordable hotels. From Utah to Nevada to all around California, I just have never had a bad experience. The location and condition of the hotel are not the best, though: The elevators and hallways in this hotel, as well as the rather junky parking area, are in dire need of rehabilitation. BUT: The room itself, once you got inside of it, was wonderful. I had a comfortable chair and desk, a nice view, a cute little TV-watching chair and a super-comfortable bed. (The wireless connection didn't work, but I always bring my own mifi, so it didn't matter that much to me.) My one big complaint, which would probably deter me from another stay, is that there was really nowhere around here to walk my dogs around. The area around the hotel is pretty ragged and messy \u2014 I didn't feel safe from broken glass and garbage \u2014 and across the street the grassy area was strewn with garbage. I used it and felt perfectly safe, but the street was busy and hard to cross and it wasn't especially pleasant. I'm not sure there's much to be done about this \u2014 it's a convenient location otherwise \u2014 but with dogs it's a challenging stay. This La Quinta offers the same breakfast as the others, except their waffle maker makes miniature waffles. I just loved that and had to mention it :) Also, DON'T follow the GPS here! Ask for directions from the hotel.

Every time we left the hotel it was pure madness. The streets were always packed with a line of cars. Very unpleasant indeed. We saw some unsavory characters strolling through the parking lot, walking around our car and other cars. That was disturbing. Further, there appeared to be several encampments of grizzly homeless people about the outside of the hotel. We just didn't feel safe there. We checked out the hot tub. When we came back some ten hours later, the same group of rowdy drunk people were still where they were when we left. However, some 40 or 50 of their beer cans were carelessly strewn about. Nice that they had their own private hot tub with greenish yellow water! That was very poor of management not to keep an eye on the public areas. Jasmine and Susan were very kind, very sweet people. We enjoyed them immensely. Susan took a liking to our little dog and gave him lots of attention and treats. He liked her too. This hotel was recently renovated. They did a fine job. But, they can't change the location of the property. And that was the reason we chose to leave. The owner should promote Jasmine.

After searching the internet extensively for a respectable hotel that was in our price rage, that wasnt infested with bed bugs or had unwanted people patrolling the parking lots, we decided with this one. It was a very good choice! We were very close to Sea World and eateries in the area which was a plus in itself. I was kinda leary when we first got to the place because of where it sits. It sits on a little side street next to the freeway, next to a boat storage facility. I was thinking to myself are we safe here? Is my car going to get broken into? But after the 1st night all my worries were soon gone. The hotel staff are extremely friendly and very helpful. The rooms are very big and comfortable. The fridge and microwave came in very handy with a toddler who needs milk and other perishable items at his beck and call hahaha I am not a breakfast eater by no means but I have this funny quirk. When I stay at a hotel it has to have a continental breakfast!!! This hotel's breakfast didnt disappoint! The pancakes were made right there, juice, all kinds of bread, bagels, muffins, eggs (scrambled one day, then a mini cheese omelet the other day), buttermilk biscuits, sausage gravy (which for a hotel was pretty delicious), sausage, ham, yogurt, cinnamon rolls (when warmed in the microwave were finger lickin good!!), cereals (4 choices), coffee and juices. I was in breakfast heaven... :) The room was well equipped with great amenities. It was clean, stocked daily, towels and bedding changed every time as well. Put it to a test to make sure they changed our sheets every day! LOL The only thing that we didnt like was, we asked for joining rooms that way we could go in and out of each other's rooms. When we got into our rooms we found out they were joining. No big deal really its just we didnt like having to leave our door propped open so we can go in and out freely. We were located at the very end of the hallway so we really didnt have to worry about foot traffic but none the less we didnt like that detail.

Comfy new beds (I love the pillows!). Decent, clean rooms. Polite employees.

There is a breakfast served in the morning with both hot and cold foods. It's not a big buffett style but it's much better then any other place I've stayed that offered a \"continental breakfast\". There are eggs, meat, pastries, juices, milk, coffee, fruits, breads, etc... We have to come back to this area again in three months and I will not stay anywhere else!

I will say first that yes, it is not in your best interest to try to get a hotel reservation the same day you arrive in San Diego, but it couldn't be avoided with the nature of our trip. Anyway, we booked three nights at this hotel and arrived at the property. I wasn't thrilled with the neighborhood-as others have said it's a little more than questionable. There are suspicious homes directly behind the hotel and car sales lots at the bottom of the hill. Anyway, this seemed to be the best we could do so we reluctantly checked in. You know things aren't going to be good when the clerk says, \"Take the elevator DOWN to your room.\" Great. So we head DOWN the stairs. The first thing I encounter is the \"security\" door is propped open. This door leads from the parking area (not gated, not secure) directly into the hotel! This is a big safety issue as far as I was concerned. Especially since we quickly discover that our room is the first one next to this open door. So we go into our room and it is beyond basic. The bathroom seemed fine enough, but the bed seemed close to the ground, thin, and sagging in the center. I'm a freak about bugs, so I checked the mattress. While I didn't encounter anything, the mattresses they have can only be described as \"bed in a bag\"...it was almost like the mattress was wrapped in a nylon stocking. While I was investigating the bed my boyfriend looks out the window only to discover that our \"view\" is of a sidewalk, but you are eye-level with the sidewalk, as in staring at people's feet and ankles as they pass! He also observed some shady \"business deal\" taking place across the street. Anyway, I decided this was completely unacceptable for all the above mentioned issues. We decided to ask for a refund. The one pro of this event is that, when I explained our concerns with the property, the clerk agreed to give us a full refund. My boyfriend did have to follow up a few days later however to have the charge removed from his card. I have stayed at Holiday Inns before and this one is AWFUL! We decided to take our chances and look for somewhere else in the city that seemed to be 100% booked. To share what ended up happening: We had booked this hotel for $180 a night (I wouldn't even pay $50 to stay here) and ended up staying at a RESORT in Mission Bay (Paradise Point) for $220 a night. A difference of $40!!! Anyway, I'm pretty reasonable, but even for travellers on a budget this hotel was not worth it. We had a great time at the other property, felt safe, relaxed, and didn't have to worry about getting robbed in the middle of the night.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cNot a bad place to stay!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "MIDMO95", "ReviewID": "UR69292247", "Content": "Stayed at the Holiday Inn Express-Mission Bay between June 21-25.

The property is pie-shaped and back from the main street. The staff was quite helpful. I interacted with 3 different individuals and they were all helpful. We needed to check out at 4:30AM in the morning to get to the Carlsbad Marathon and the food was already out at that time, which was really nice. The staff person said to take whatever we wanted and even gave us some lids for the juices. The breakfast is above average with hot food such as eggs and sausage. Yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, cereal, juices, milk, etc was all there and nicely laid out. There is not a lot of restaurants nearby. There was a McDonalds, which we did not go to. We really didn't hang out at the hotel. The rooms were what you would expect from a Holiday Inn Express. No worse, no better. I used the free internet service and it was easy to connect to and was fast enough to meet my needs from my room on 3rd floor. There is also a computer in the lobby that is availble for guests, which I always think is a nice feature. All in all, the price here was $20 cheaper than comparable hotels in the area.

I'm glad I did and at the same time I probably would have chosen a different hotel (logistical reasons only). Review: This hotel is appropriately rated as a 2-2.5 Star accomodation. The hotel itself is nothing that will knock your socks off but the Customer Service was top notch and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. I had requested a King room but they gave me a Double Queen room instead but it was no big deal. I stayed in on the 3rd floor and the room was very clean and comfortable. There was no \"musty\" smell that some other guests have reported but it appears if the just installed new carpeting and fresh paint on the walls so there is a bit of the \"new\" smell going on but not over powering. I found the bed(s) to be extremely comfortable with two choices of pillows (soft or firm), which I thought was a nice touch for sensitive sleepers. I was also really impressed with the quality of towels they provided. From the bath size down to the face cloths, they were very nice, almost robe-like in quality and thickness. Nothing major but a very nice touch in my opinion. The Hot Breakfast wasn't the greatest but there were lots of options with regards to bagels and english muffins, baked goods, cereals, coffee and juices. I found it to be avove average as far as Continentals go. The Business Center consists of a desktop computer with a laser printer. Definitely not what I would consider a BC but for some who does not have a lap top or needed to print out some documents, it was more than serviceable. Free Wi-Fi is pretty standard now but it was nice to have. The HIE also had a Pool and Cardio center which I did not use but it was nice to know it was available. I don't have much negative to say about the hotel but as another guest reported, the desk is located right next to the AC Unit so I had to turn it off and on every now and then. The free parking is limited and is a little tight at the front but under cover it's like a normal parking lot. The hotel is also a little tricky to get to, depending on how you're coming in. A little navigation savvy is required but after a day of driving around it's not too bad. In the end, I was pleasantly surprised considering the beating this hotel took in previous reviews. Perhaps all of the positives were due to recent renovations but either way, I would definitely recommend this hotel!", "Date": "June 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anderson, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cFriends don't let friends stay here.\u201d", "Author": "aufvedersehen", "ReviewID": "UR15139383", "Content": "Well first of all let me say I would never stay at this hotel again.

Got out at the intersection and walked up the ramp, but had to walk up and down the ramp, through a garage and around the property to find the entrance. it's not intuituive.

But the humidity was out of this world. I am from the desert, so I might think little humidity is alot, but there was a noticeable difference in the outside humidity to the inside. Once I started inspecting though, I found black mold all over the bathroom, under the wallpaper and more near the baseboards near the beds on the wall. It was so humid I almost passed out. The parking was horrific with tiny iddy biddy spots to squeeze into. Upon inspection, the entire facility dripped into the parking garage. The entire parking garage was dripping, everything in the hotel was wet and humid. The highlights were the fantastic staff, who put out the continental breakfast at 5am for us. The breakfast had some good cinnamon rolls, and otherwise was sub-par. The work out room had nice clean and new ish machines, but if you like watching tv the tv only worked on the bottom half.

I booked using Hotwire, my first time, and after the hotel name popped up I checked tripadvisor and I was scared to death after reading all the negative reviews. After telling my wife what happened she immediately sprang into action, God bless her, and she contacted the hotel manager and quizzed him regarding hotel condition, amenities and poor travel site reviews. He let her know that he knew exactly what she was talking about and that he was new and was brought in to remedy the problems. She felt good about their conversation and we decided to take a chance and check in. The Room: First, this is NOT a three star hotel and I will not be using Hotwire again because of this experience. I paid $98 a night for Mon/Tue/Wed during spring break which I guess was a fair price. At most, I'd give this hotel two stars. We stayed on the 3rd floor, freeway side and our room had been given a recent makeover (rm 325). It was clean but very small, with a tiny bathroom, and it included a microwave and mini-fridge. We didn't notice any excessive noise from the freeway. We had no problems with the room although I heard a few people being reassured by the manager that various problems like leaky plumbing and no electricity in the room were taken care of. Amenities: The pool and hot tub were small but functional on the bottom floor surrounded by a wooden security fence. Apparently new pool deck furniture is being ordered. The adjacent workout room was small but functional with 3 cardio machines. The hotel breakfast was of a type being offered at several hotel chains with cereal, various muffins and bagels, a toaster, yogurt, whole fruit, no meats and warm cinnamon rolls. The hotel also had a small plate of freshly baked cookies at the front desk every evening. There was a single computer and printer in the lobby for internet access first come, first serve. Parking was free (very unusual out there) but very cramped and totally unsecured which brings me to the location. Hotel Location: This hotel is on a typical steep grade leading up to the 5. There is no buffer to adjacent office buildings and businesses whatsoever. There are two, small parking garages one at the lobby level and one at the pool/basement level as well as a single row of spaces butting up to a wall opposite the lobby entrance. I wouldn't stay here without a car but if you get in late, you'd probably have to park in the street. It sure seems like San Diego parking spaces are more narrow that the rest of the country. At the bottom of the street on the west side of the hotel, there's a day laborer pickup area so we were treated to various sights like a laborer peeing in the street and homeless types walking back and forth by the open (unsecurable) basement garage entrance. Mission Beach: If you go west down Garnet to Grand you'll soon be at Mission Beach and a short drive from La Jolla and a number of beach areas. For those booking a family vacation, Mission Beach is a mixed bag with areas appealing to the young alternative adult types with lots of bars, skateboards and tattoo parlors as well as family resorts. Do your research before you book. And people drive like maniacs in this area. I witnessed a motorcycle/car hit and run and two fender benders on this small stretch from the hotel to the beach. Away from the ocean there are several nice restaurants and plenty of shopping. If you go south on Mission Bay Dr there are several family oriented parks and beaches as is the San Diego Visitor Center which offers discounted attraction tickets and hotel rooms. Customer Service: We had terrific customer service during the day and were completely ignored by anyone at the front desk during the evening. There is clearly an effort by management and staff to treat the customer better. The cleaning staff work room was at the basement level and there were several signs, written in spanish advising the employees on how to treat guests. Perhaps they should post a few at the front desk. In general, given the choices out there, I probably would not stay here again unless the price was $79 or so.

I have never had someone be so rude. I went back upstairs and booked another hotel for the remainder of my stay.

Breakfast is \"OK\". I didn't find the parking to be difficult as others have stated and we had a midsize car. We also found the hotel to be quiet-I think it depends on the room you get. Staff was nice, but I just cannot recommend this place due to the smell and hot tub. It's inexpensive, but don't expect it to be like other Holiday Inn Express hotels which are usually not too bad.", "Date": "April 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cDon't do it....just don't do it!\u201d", "Author": "coffee_boy", "ReviewID": "UR4996346", "Content": "I have stayed at Holiday Inn Express in different places and have been reasonably satisfied....until now!!! Well, The Mission Bay location is terrible...located right behind a tire store on a hill. The property is crammed, it does not have a proper hotel entrance. Parking is tighter than the \"posterior\" of a rat! When you think you are in Mission Bay....that is a BIG stretch with this location. It is central, and close to the I-5 Highway, but not right in the main Mission Bay area. The room smelled bad, carpets were badly soiled, we were not comfortable to walk in bare feet. The bathroom had no exhaust....so when you shower...it totally fogs up. In short, don't stay at this place!! Even if you are trying to save a few BUCKS...Don't do it!! The whole place has bad VIBES!! As I was checking out...there was a crazy lady in the lobby trying to get a room with no credit card.....saying \"god had sent her to this hotel\". He must have been punishing her for something really bad.

I made reservations for a four-night (Tue \u2013 Fri) stay. But, during the first evening, I discovered that I had no hot water. I contacted the front desk, and they agreed to waive the charges for my first night\u2019s stay. In spite of our prior agreement, the lady on the front desk during my check-out said that she knew nothing of such a arrangement, and that I would have to contact her manager the following Monday because he only worked Monday thru Friday.
