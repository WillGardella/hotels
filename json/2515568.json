So, we decided to book a Best Western Plus, thinking that the plus meant that this is a upgrade on the usual Best Western standard. During the four weeks in the USA we had used a lot of Best Western hotels and that resultated in a promotion in their awards programme from Gold to Platinum. When we arrived the Platinum status wasn't in their booking, so I had to ask for the welcome-packet for Platinum members. Next, we didn't get the upgrade in the room that usually belongs to a Platinum status in a loyalty programme. The room we got, was small, but clean. The breakfast was average and the hotel didn't have a pool. So, we could not see what was \"plus\" in this hotel. We have stayed in much better Best Western hotels during our trip that didn't have the \"plus-status\". Finally, we wanted a late check-out at 5.30 pm, because our plane left San Diego at 8 pm that night. We had to pay a charge of $75 for keeping the room for another couple of hours, although one of the benefits the Best Western Rewards programme offers to Platinum members is a late check-out upon availabilty. And the room was available, because the hotel was virtually empty the day we left San Diego. So in all, a bit disappointing.

The rooms were definitely not large though they were functional--a desk for using the computer (both ethernet and wireless at a decent rate of speed), a round table with chairs if you take a meal in room, and a very comfortable bed.

This corner room had a queen bed rather than the king reserved, and we knew for a 6 day stay we definitely wanted a window onto the cute, heavily gardened exterior hallways. They did then change us to a true king room with window upon request. This took minor negotiating/insistence, but they were very courteous in the end if a bit formal. The room itself was spacious enough, but a little hard to navigate because of the large pieces of furniture. The tiled shower (no bath) was spacious, but the rest of the bathroom was a very tight squeeze with minimal counter space. It was great to have a mini-fridge for leftovers, and complimentary breakfast was WAY above average, including hot hash brown patties, real eggs, sausage plus the more typical cold cereals, toast, and packaged danishes. The best things about this hotel are the incredibly central location and the value for what you get. Nice furniture and bathroom tile, free internet with cables in every room in case the wifi signal is too weak, and in-room safes that fit a 15\" laptop. As for the location, it's only two blocks for buses to Balboa Park and the Zoo, and four blocks to two other, larger transit centers, with both bus and trolley stops. The Gaslamp restaurant district begins about 7 blocks away, or you can take the nearby orange trolley if going to the far end and don't want to walk.

After some surfing on the FREE wireless internet while eating the great, FREE breakfast we discovered it was cheaper to rent a car, drive to L.A., get a hotel there, and book a new flight than it was to reschedule with American Airlines (jerks...and by the way, Virgin America rocks. fly them!). We explained this to the front desk - along with being very clear we'd stay another night except for needing to get home earlier than planned - and found the front desk staff to be incredibly understanding...so much so they only charged us for one night despite the fact that we'd already paid for the two nights. I can't say enough how appreciative we were of this given the rest of our travel extravaganza. In summary, this was a wonderful hotel...I don't fault them a bit for the fact they had some rowdy patrons the night we were there.

This little motel is very conveniently located close the the freeway, and the Gaslamp district. I came to San Diego for a girls weekend getaway with my best friend, and we felt very comfortable to stay here. It is NOT in the best part of town, but if you were looking for that, you should plan on spending a lot more money, or staying further away from the popular areas of San Diego. I was extremely pleased with the cleanliness of our room and bathroom. The rooms are small, the beds are squeezed in, but it is CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN. The beds and bedding were spotless, and the mattress was very comfortable. My advice is for women traveling with a male companion to stay on the 2nd floor. If you are not a smoker, all the rooms are non-smoking, but be aware that during the free breakfast (and perhaps at other times of the day) guests who are smokers tend to congregate at the picnic tables outside the the office, which means the second-hand smoke enters your room if you have a room right by these tables, or above the tables. Do not plan on walking around this neighborhood at night - drive where you have to go. However, daytime exploration is just fine. We walked all the way down to the pier, and it was a blast. Also, my only small complaint, is that the carpet is old, and for some reason, aggravated my sinus allergies through out the night. Other than that, I cannot complain.

It has the basic L-shaped motel layout, but it's been enclosed with a hedge and a line of young trees.

The room was smallish, but fine. The beds were comfortable, and there was a nice little desk. Free coffee in the room and in the lobby. A better-than-continental breakfast. The location is OK; it's a few blocks from the shops and restaurants of the Gaslamp district. It has the potential to be a \"Bed and Breakfast\" type experience, but the staff are pretty impersonal. Nothing wrong or badly handled, but it felt more like buying something at a shop than being welcomed into a \"luxury\" establishment. (Yes, \"luxury\" is on their sign, too. Along with Garden.) Only grumble is minor: I wanted a late checkout; they couldn't tell me until the next day, when they gave me only 1 hour. Considering we'd only checked in around 6.30 p.m., this seemed a bit stingy.

Nothing great but enough to start the day. The negatives: parking is not really quite adequate. If you're the last person to check in you might not get a parking space ... actually I did get a space, but only because the front desk person let me park in the handicapped parking space (because no one was using it). Even then the parking lot is a tight squeeze -- if you've got a large vehicle, you'll need to gingerly edge in and out. There is street parking nearby (but with parking meters which become active during the daytime) and commercial parking lots a block or two away, but that'd be a real hassle and extra expense.

Our flight arrived late morning and consequently we reached the hotel at 1:00 p.m. Having reserved our room based on the inn's previous reviews on this site, we were most pleased to see that this is indeed a very attractive, small hotel. Although situated in an urban area, the owners have gone to great effort to surround the property with beautiful flower boxes, planters and attractive landscaping. Although check-in time technically wasn't until later in the afternoon, the front desk clerk cheerfully welcomed us and showed us to our room. Formerly a typical 1950's motor court-style hotel, the inn underwent a complete remodel only a few years ago. Rather than a sterile, institutional refurbishing, the owners have taken pains to establish a more boutique-style setting. While the exterior corridors remain and there is no elevator, all guest rooms are on the first or second floor. There is a rooftop area which has seating, lush flower boxes, container plants, and a gazebo. Additionally a small patio area is located off the lobby. Our room was small (standard 1950's-sized hotel room with two double beds and not much open floor space), but it was tastefully decorated and furnished with quality furniture and bedding. The bathroom had a ceramic-tiled shower (no tub) which was spotlessly clean, as was the rest of our room. Overall, our room was much like those we have had in plush B&B's. A complimentary breakfast was offered each morning in the hotel lobby, but indoor seating was limited. However, the weather was so nice that we availed ourselves of the patio and rooftop eating areas. Breakfast itself was really the only thing we could even remotely criticize... the scrambled eggs were dry, the bacon strips were not \"real\" but a processed breakfast strip, and the danish were institutional variety-packaged in cellophane. However, cereal was available, as was juice, coffee and milk. We would be remiss if we did not mention the hotel staff! They were EXTREMELY helpful... not only did they provide us a map, but they also made great sight-seeing and restaurant suggestions which saved us both time and money.
