If you are looking for the Ritz, this is definately not it. What you have is a gem located in Chinatown. I stayed here in September for 1 week with my sister and bestfriend and had the best time. My personal advice is that if you flew in to NYC (via LaGuardia) you can get a week train pass from the Hudson News Stand for like $29 dollars. It is located by baggage claim. GET THIS! YOU WILL GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH....even if your stay 3 or 4 days, at $2.25 each way it adds up fast. Anyway, the F train is a 5 min walk. My sister and I did not pack any bathroom toiletries and we found everything we needed across the street at the asian pharmacy. It had everything we needed. There is a Starbucks about a 15 min walk at Allen and Delancey. If your worried about the walk then you better get used to it, that seems to be all that you do in NYC. After going out at night in the East Village I took a cab back and with generous tip I spent $10. Back to the hotel, it is very clean, had an Iron and board, and a blow dryer, clean towels, ice and vending machines. If you come to NYC to stay in the room and order room sevice you better stay in Midtown and pay the price. If you are coming to NYC and want to dig in and enjoy what the city has to offer than this is the best place to stay. I dont think most people are realistic in their expectations when staying places, certaintantly in New York. Stay here and see for yourself, and if you think its bad....book a room at The Carter in Midtown for a night and then let us know what you think.

Keeping that in mind this hotel is clean, beds are comfortable and the rooms are mold free.

The staff is minimum, no concierge, no bellboy, but professional and helpful. There is NO Wi Fi, but the rooms are equipped with a LAN cable and the speed of the connection is good. If you need a computer, they have one (with printer) alongside the vending machines on the 4th floor. TV is limited. But if you come to NY to watch TV maybe you should stay home. It is in Chinatown, that means the streets are dirty and smelly and all that. But it also means that you are 2 blocks away from the F train and therefore 15 min from anywhere in Manhattan you may want to go. One thing: coming back late at night could be a bit daunting by the looks of it. The streets around it are deserted and you may feel uneasy. But the same is true for every other lower manhattan hotel ten times more expensive. Which brings me to the price: I know it is expensive, but not for Manhattan. Your options on this price bracket are usually awful (The Carter, The Pennsylvania\u2026) and this hotel is way better than those in what really matters to me: A good bed, a good room, a clean hotel.

I was pleasantly surprised on both those fronts. Firstly, I had a room at the rear of the hotel, right next to the bridge on the second floor (the lowest occupied level) and the noise was almost non-existent - equivalent to the occasional, gentle rumbling of distant thunder. I don't know if this is worse on higher floors, but having heard so much about the trains going past, I was hugely relieved, and I slept like a baby every night on the immensely comfortable bed. IIt was certainly a LOT quieter than having to listen to the constant beeping of cab horns all night long when I stayed in a hotel in midtown. Secondly, Chinatown was a brilliant location in which to stay. The hotel is a mere two blocks away from the subway station (F train - a few stops into the city) and a short walk away from the financial district, the East village, downtown etc. Also, Chinatown itself is a really fascinating, vibrant, colourful area of Manhattan - full of interesting sights, sounds and yes, smells. It is also home to dozens and dozens of excellent restaurants. Can recommend the Famous Sichuan, and Red Egg. If you really need some US style breakfast, walk for a few minutes, or get the subway uptown. Walked home a few nights at between 1am and 3am and it was very safe. The room was a decent size for Manhattan and extremely clean. Service was excellent, and the sheets and towels changed every night. Really impressed with the housekeeping.

It is a very clean hotel, with comfortable beds and adequate in-room amenities. $166 per night for room with two double beds during my stay. No coffee maker, no fridge, but instant coffee in the lobby. Believe the other reviewers who state that the train noise is problematic -- it is astonishingly loud, even with the good quality, modern, double-paned windows. Pay $20 extra per night for the double-double-bed rooms -- there are only two per floor, they face the street not the train. While this location is technically Soho (south of Houston St, with central Soho being trendy and filled with cafes and such), THIS HOTEL IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DOWNSCALE PART OF CHINATOWN, it is not even the touristy part of Chinatown. There is not a typical convenience store or diner within several blocks in any direction. There is no food other than chinese food for a LOONNNGGG distance in any direction, although a KFC is several blocks away (towards what tourists think of as Chinatown). The nearest subway station is two LONG blocks away, in the direction away from the nicer part of Chinatown. After dark, the entire neighborhood shuts down because this is a business area, so there is NOTHING to do besides eat at a chinese restaurant. The walk back to the hotel after dark -- particularly at 11pm if you travelled up to Broadway to see a show -- is desolate and creepy. DO NOT try it alone, even though police officers are stationed near the East Broadway station and will offer escort to travelers walking alone, which is a very strong warning that you should heed. In order to reach any tourist area other than Chinatown, you will have a long ride on the F train, and only the local F stops at the East Broadway station. If everything goes well, and you happen to catch the F quickly, and then catch your connecting train very quickly, you are still going to be AT LEAST 30 - 45 minutes to reach Times Square, Columbus Circle, etc. The time you spend waiting and traveling will leach daylight hours and personal energy out of your vacation, so do not be tempted by a \"cheap\" hotel rate in this incredibly poor location. If you spend an extra $50 a night to stay in a modest hotel closer to midtown you will make it back on subway fare and cabs that you won't need to take. Having said that.... if you stay here you will want to bring a cooler for snacks and beverages. There are no bars, cafes, coffee shops for after-dinner drinks or dessert nearby, you will need to provide for yourself in your room. Bring a day pack because once you leave your room you will likely not return until dark - it is just too far. While in more typical areas of the city, remember to stop in a drug or convenience store to buy anything needed -- there are no stores of that type near Hotel 91 and you will be trapped in your hotel after dark unless you arrange for a cab. Good things nearby: Wonderful dim sum and authentic chinese food 3 - 4 blocks away in the nice/tourist part of Chinatown. Little Italy several blocks away (but not walkable at night, there's another cab ride), lots of inexpensive but good personal services like beauty salons, foot massage/reflexology shops, chinese bakeries with interesting pastries to try.

The only down side is the subway which backed on to our room but I imagine if you could request a room on the other side there would be no such problem with noise, having said that we were so exhausted after sightseeing and shopping all day that we slept reasonably well anyway. Location: being located in Chinatown there obviously is not much but Chinese restaurants directly outside in terms of food however, there is a diner called 'Everest' Diner about 3-4 blocks away if you turn left out of the hotel which does nice pancakes for breakfast and is fairly reasonable. Wall street, the seaport (for Staten Island Ferry), The World Trade Centre and Century 21 (massive department store with loads of bargains) are about a 15-20 walk away and the subway for stops like Rockerfeller and central Manhattan stops (F train) is about 2-3 blocks away if you turn right outside the hotel (Grand St.) Overall, a very comfortable and enjoyable stay no it may not be the Ritz but you get what you pay for.

There are a couple of subway stations within a few blocks, but strangely enough, we never took them. We would walk towards SoHo and LES at the start of each day.

I do a lot of research before booking a hotel and this seemed to be the best compromise between location, price and quality. Firstly the bad points. We stayed for a total of four nights in two different rooms. The first room had two queen beds and the second had two single beds. Both rooms looked onto the manhattan bridge (which is used by both cars and the subway). If you are a light sleeper, I would not recommend this hotel especially if you have a room overlooking the bridge. I personally am a light sleeper but I think the combination of adjusting to the different time zone and fatigue from walking around all day meant that I wasn't woken too often. I spoke to a couple staying at the hotel who didn't fair as well as I did and had a hard time sleeping. The only way to get around this is to insist on a room not facing Manhattan bridge. The location is both good and bad depending how you look at it. It is 5-7 minutes walk to the E broadway subway station but it is also in the middle of Chinatown. I'm not a big fan of chinese food so I had to usually walk to Little Italy (15 minutes) to get something to eat. There are only oriental restaurants within 10-15 minutes walk. Also, being in chinatown means you have to put up with the smells of fish and piles of rubbish bags in the street. The location is therefore not for everyone. The rooms are modern and clean. The size of the rooms were fine as well. We didn't have any issues with the reception staff. They were helpful. I've given this hotel a 4 rating purely because it is probably the best value for money hotel in manhattan.

However, as it turned out there was NO need to have worried. The East Broadway Metro station was a little less than 2 blocks from the hotel and took us everywhere we wanted to go. Since there was only the \"F\" train, it was simple to navigate to all of our destinations. Within 15 minutes we were at 42nd & 6th Ave, which is Bryant Park. To get to Times Square all you had to do was walk one block over to 7th ave and you were there. During New Year's Eve this worked out perfectly, because we did not encounter a lot of foot traffic either coming or going. If you got off the train one stop earlier at 34th and 6th Ave. you were right in Herald Square (Penn Staion/Madison Square Garden/ Empire State Building). One stop after Bryant Park/Times Square you were at Rockefeller Plaza location and one block over by foot you were in the midst of Broadway. With this hotel and its easy access \"F\" train we went everywhere we wanted to go in short time without any confusion. We even felt secure enough for our teen sons (14 & 16) to catch the train from the hotel and meet up with us later. As well, the hotel felt safe. The staff was young, yet very friendly and professional. The room (double queen), although very small, it did accomodate the 4 of us after we strategically placed our luggage. The room was clean and we were fortunate enough to be on the second floor which had the lounge area, big plasma screen TV and 24 hr. coffee and tea. Sometimes we hung out there when we needed a little more elbow room. Even with this lounge on the 2nd floor, it was always quiet in our room which was right next to it. I believe the rooms are very well sound proofed, as we also faced the Manhattan Bridge side, but was not truly disturbed by the train noise. You heard a low rumble periodically, but it was not noticeable and definitely did not awake us or prevent us from going to sleep. Although most of the sinage on the establishments in that area were written in Chinese, there were still places to go. There's a nice LITTLE diner one block up on Canal Street called Cup and Saucer. They serve large, tasty portions at fairly reasonable prices. They also deliver with a minimal purchase of $10. There's also a Popeye's Chicken a street over from Cup and Saucer. And there are a number of Chinese restaurants, with a few a bit more Americanized than the rest. There were massage, facial and hair salons that appeared busy and talented, although I did not personally visit any. And let's not forget the shopping on Canal street. I will attach pictures later, but the hotel is pretty much as depicted on their website; however, our room only had a view of the bridge.

Similar to any budget hotels, although it lacks a few amenities that I consider basic: wi-fi in the rooms, fridge, vending machines etc., - The visitors are mainly Asian tourists and young travelers, both of which you hardly see or hear. The Bad: - Zero security: there are three entrances to the hotel and they are unmanned, the concierge is on a separate floor from the entrances, and anyone can walk-in any of those entrances and take the elevator to any floor in the hotel. There are also no security camera's. - It is 1 meter away from a busy bridge on which the Coney Island express runs and a major road runs underneath. It is extremely loud and the hotel shakes. - There is zero customer service, I personally am not very demanding and don't often need much, but this was ridiculous. The staff were not willing to help you out with anything, and/or did not now the answer to most of the questions asked and were surprised to be asked very basic questions, such as \"where can I buy some water?\". ---The Area---- The Good: - As far as lower east side hotels this one is fairly cheap and decent. It is close to Brooklyn and LES, and a short walk to the subway. The Bad: - This place is dead...DEAD(for emphasis) after 9 p.m. or so. Everything is boarded up and there is no where to grab a bite or buy snacks. Only the homeless roam the area after a certain hour, and although they are harmless, if your alone it can be unpleasant. - It is in China Town, so it is a bit dirty from the food stores. ---The Rooms--- The Good: - They are typical of the price range, no frills, modest decor. This one is relatively new and things are kept very clean. -Bathroom en-suite, no sharing. The Bad: - They are small, the train running past is loud, the windows don't open. - We didn't really want to go back there much, and sometimes after a long day you need to re-charge for a bit before heading out again. ---The Price--- - Overall it is not that cheap that it would be worthwhile staying here. I would recommend moving uptown or midtown to the cheaper hotels there, despite the less desirable location and being further from LES. - They charge you for storing your bag after checkout; I have never encountered this.

The neighborhood is safe but not pleasant. Subway is a 6-8 minutes from the hotel and the F line runs along 6th Av.", "Date": "October 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampton, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ucstefi", "ReviewID": "UR20991489", "Content": "My friend & I stayed at Hotel 91 in Chinatown for 1 night ~ Saturday, 9/27/08. I read the reviews here religiously to make sure I chose wisely & was prepared for everything. We chose this hotel b/c it is literally 1 block from where our bus drops off/picks up. So, for our purposes the location couldn't have been better. We arrived in NYC at an unexpected 6am! The bus driver had a lead foot. Happily, our room was available & we went right up. It was eery that the entire first floor was vacant, nothing but empty tiny shops with glass windows. It was a pain in the @$$ that check-in/out was on the second floor - just added 1 more thing you had to do when coming in creating an unecessary ripple in what would ordinarily be a smooth arrival. The staff were incredibly friendly (& gorgeous) throughout our entire stay, including my phone calls to confirm our reservation, as well as another reservation I made for October which I had to switch around, then ultimately cancel. Our room was nice - the walls were bare - something I'm not used to seeing, but I guess I prefer nothing as opposed to tacky, cheap art on the walls. The Manhattan Bridge was right outside our window & we naturally heard the trains, but it wasn't enough to be a bother. The bathroom was beautiful, but while unpacking my travel case I saw some dried-on brown gunk near the faucet, which I was able to remove w/ my fingernail. Now for the shower...while my friend was taking a shower I heard this loud Clang!!, followed by her laughing - thank god. She burst out in a towel & asked me, \"Did you hear that?!\" The handle that controlled the water flow/temperature had fallen off & into the tub. This made adjusting the water temperature a nightmare. We could shove the handle back on & adjust the temperature slowly, but it took forever. The A/C worked great, but that D@*%^D remote gadget was ridiculous. It looked like something you could use to fly a spaceship with. Why the need to be so complicated? It sucked that we were only provided with 1 tall cabinet to store our clothing. This closet only had 3 hangers & a small shelf at the bottom. My friend ended up keeping everything in her suitcase - just not enough room to accomodate clothing/shoes for 2 people!!! The beds were like a dream - probably the 2nd best hotel bed I have ever slept in. The linens were pristine & the beds came w/ 4 pillows!! That was a fantastic bonus. I'm used to just 2 crappy pillows - I lay there wishing I had 2 more....this hotel made my wish come true!! Very clean & superbly comfortable. Overall our stay was very nice. However, when I returned home I realized I had left my camera's battery charger plugged into an outlet in the hotel room - I even have a picture to prove it - take a look & see! I made numerous phone calls to the hotel regarding this & while they were very nice & promised to leave a note & call to let me know either way, etc. etc. It resulted in nothing - not even the phone call they promised to let me know whether or not they found it. I've since replaced it, but that lack of effeciency & customer service is troubling. Overall we enjoyed our stay & would go back - the price was decent for what we got ~ $199. And, if anyone stays in room 403 & sees my battery charger in the outlet by the television - tell the front desk asap!! :)", "Date": "October 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAn ok, no frills stay.\u201d", "Author": "deedee888", "ReviewID": "UR20454935", "Content": "This was the second hotel we stayed at during our ten day long visit to New York. We picked this hotel for three primary reasons. 1. It is located in Manhattan 2. For it's location, the price we paid was a bargain, with many other Manhattan hotels charging roughly 50% more than what we was paying 3.The hotel was less than a month old, and we wanted a clean room. Overall, I would say our stay was ok. Location wise, we got lost a few times trying to find the hotel as Chinatown is so chaotic and it's easy to lose your way. Getting to Midtown Manhattan (where we spent a lot of our time) proved to be more difficult than when we stayed in Long Island City where the no.7 train took us to Times Sq in less than 15 mins. So before you book, do find out where you will be spending most of your time. This hotel is good for Chinatown, Statue of Liberty, Battery park, Wall Street and of course SoHo. The hotel was clean and so were the towels. But the rooms were very small, and with basic ameneties. One criticism is the doors have very big gaps, and the windows have poor insulation which means it can be very noisy with the hotel being beside the Subway track. All in all, for what we paid, I feel we did get value for money, but Iit appears that prices have risen to $300+ per night, and this seems a tad high to me for a very basic room, which does not even have an in-room mini bar ,a safe or even a luggage stand. On the upside, there was free internet access, free coffee/tea making facility in the lobby area and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I would stay at this hotel again, but only if this was the cheapest Manhattan hotel available to me at the time.", "Date": "September 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Palm Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cI love Hotel 91 in Chinatown\u201d", "Author": "CitizenCarmen", "ReviewID": "UR20308535", "Content": "Great place right in the heart of Chinatown.

I needed a place to stay on the Lower East Side for a class I was taking. After reading various reviews, I decided to take a chance on Hotel 91. My roommate and I had a wonderful experience. The hotel was clean, sparkling bathrooms, crisp white comforters and very plush beds. Having stayed at hotels in NYC, including The Plaza, I was hesitant, but I needn't have been. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful and the noise was nothing like some of the reviews said. Yes, the hotel is near the Manhattan Bridge, but the windows are double pane with an air layer in between. Any sounds we heard were much quieter than most hotel air-conditioners. And the air-conditioner in the room here was extremely quiet and worked well. We requested a room that overlooked the street and also one that was large since we were going to be there for five nights. We got a handicapped accessible room that was quite ample for the two of us - 2 queen size beds. The outer hallway was huge; there was even another bathroom directly across from our room. The decor is spartan; nothing on the walls, an armoire for a closet, no ironing board or iron, but there was a flat HDTV and it worked for us. It doesn't have amenities like a restaurant or swimming pool but for our needs, it was just fine. We even got a discount because we stayed there for more than 4 nights. The flavor of Chinatown was really an added plus. We could walk to Little Italy and experience all the sights and sounds of the area. I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again.", "Date": "August 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oswego, NY", "Title": "\u201cWeird decor, good value, helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "swegotravels", "ReviewID": "UR18890042", "Content": "The hotel is in a weird part of town, not particularly central to any part of the city but a great cultural experience in one of New York's oldest neighborhoods nonetheless. The decor is a bit drab, when you first walk in you see a bunch of glass stalls, which upon further investigation are supposed to be stores. (How you're supposed to have a store in a 5 foot by 10 foot space I have no idea) The 2nd floor is where the front desk is, which was fine, the staff was pretty efficient and very warm and personable, unlike a lot of Manhattan hotels. They were helpful throughout the entire stay. The lounge area on the second floor is terribly decorated. It looks like someone took all of their grandmother's junk from the last 40 years and threw it in one room. There is a flatscreen tv, but it's surrounded by 3 junky old leather couches (the hotel is supposedly new, would it have been too much to spend $2000 to put 3 new couches in? After all, it's the first thing people see when they walk in.). Then there is a big white porcelain elephant and what looks like an urn just sitting on the floor next to the couch. Doesn't go with the couches, the TV or the rickety old chinese furniture in the room. The carpet in the lobby areas throughout the hotel is just horrid looking, it makes you dizzy just walking on it, it looks kind of like the carpet from \"The Shining\". The rooms themselves have just about everything you really need for a hotel stay: TV, internet, comfortable bed, private bathroom. The decor is pretty shabby, cheap vinyl chairs and furniture that looks like it was made by a boy scout at camp. Cheap plastic covered wood. The bathroom marble counter doesn't match the tiles on the floor or the wall. Looks like someone went to a lot of hardware clearance sales. For its price, the hotel is actually a good value and I'm being overly picky about the decorator's terribly bad taste. But whichever interior decorator did the hotel should definitely reconsider their career. The only real gripes I have are: A. Cleanliness - A lot of other reviewers have said this hotel is clean. I would agree, at first glance. But a closer look would reveal a lot of corner cutting. The middle of the room gets vacuumed but there is dirt at the edges. The windows never get cleaned and are outright filthy. Stains and smudges on the walls. Garbage in the hallways, stairwells and elevators. It's obvious that their housekeepers are understaffed and overworked, so it's understandable they can't get to everything. But it doesn't excuse the fact that things aren't clean. B. Someone else had mentioned a nosy owner during their stay, and I would agree. During my check in, a similar old lady came out of the elevator, walked around the line (3-4 people waiting to check in at this point) to the side of the counter and started demanding things from the kid working the counter (who was obviously already speaking with a customer). \"Print this, is so and so here, I need this and that.\" in a very loud and obnoxious manner. Very unprofessional in a hotel environment and obviously could have waited until after guests had finished. After she had gotten her list of demands, the kid said \"Sorry for the inconvenience, but that was the owner\". The next day, the owner happened to be on the elevator when I got on and tried to make small talk. It turned into a grilling about what I was doing on my trip to New York and then an endless list of things I SHOULD do according to her. If I needed the advice I would have asked. Obviously this is the owner's first hotel and she has no experience whatsoever with hospitality. She would be well advised to take after her employees a bit, who actually made an otherwise very average stay pretty pleasant. For the price, the hotel is a good place to stay. Just avoid the owner and pretend you're colorblind when you look at the decor.", "Date": "August 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Beach, CA", "Title": "\u201cVery Clean Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jolly56", "ReviewID": "UR18468089", "Content": "Never had been to New York before but kinda of a last minute thing.

She asked the front desk clerkif they needed any change, so I figured it was either a manager or the owner.

The owner still in her fishing clothes, interrupted the conversation out of no where and tried to help but all she did was talk for 10 minutes straight giving directions that I couldn't even understand When I got up to the sixth floor to go to my room, there was an old piece of furniture that looks kinda like a tombstone that fell apart. Also the lobby looks like they went to a garage sale and just bought everything and threw it in one room.
