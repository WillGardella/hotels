Otherwise we would never have found it, let alone chosen it. If you are visiting \"the sights\" of Paris it is a long way. In fact it's not even in Paris, being the wrong side of the Peripherique. But it's a short walk to the metro and there is a T2 tram outside if you want to go to La Defense. I read some older reviews before we traveled and I can confirm that the stains on the carpets are still there after 3 years. There is no service in the rooms whatsover. You will have to change your bedding and vacuum the floor yourself. The leg of one (small single) bed was broken when we arrived but I fixed it myself. However, the people at the front desk were friendly and helpful. There is a nice restaurant in Corentin nearby \"Bistro du Boucher\".

I think it's only fair to update those negative reviews. Adagio Paris took over this faculty back in 2008 and the renovations were awesome. My condo was modern, and well-decorated. However, the shower could use a vent and it's a steep step to get out. If you use the metro to get around, it can be a little trek. The light rail is steps from the hotel door. Maybe I could have taken advantage of that better. I found that taxi drivers will drive you all over the city unless you appear to know where you're going. The morning breakfast was worth the 10 euros. The staff could have been a little bit more alert of the neighborhood. They sent me to restaurants that were closed.

The mini kitchen is very helpful, but I think nobody cleans all the kitchenware, the fridge wasn't working, it was dirty and full of water inside - the smell was terrible! They fixed that after I report it, yet they haven't cleaned inside the fridge. If you stay a longer period, be aware that they clean rooms once every 7 days! Other wise, the reception staff was very helpful, able to speak other languages (English, Spanish etc) and the free wifi offers a good Internet connection.
