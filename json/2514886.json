However, the pricing was very good and given some of the recent photos taken by other travelers on this site, we decided to have a go. We enjoyed it due to the following: 1. The location was quite good. Close to some main streets and relatively close to the metro station, making is convenient to go to different sites and places 2. Felt like a nice and safe neighborhood 3. The room we got was very recently renovated. Even though it was small, it had everything we needed. The shower is a rain shower, so that was a nice touch. 4. While we were staying there, there were renovations going on on other floors. So if you are looking to stay there, you may get a very very new hotel room :) 5. Free water/juices from the mini bar, which was great Overall, while the hotel room was small, it was a very nice experience. The staff was always friendly and there was not a lot of people using the free internet at the lobby and we were able to book things and check emails whenever we wanted to.

In this situation, I am usually disappointed, but not this time. Let's start with the downsides. This is a small, boutique style hotel and doesn't have all of the fancy amenities that you will find at the bigger 3 and 4 star hotels, however, it is also less expensive. Also, as with many older buildings in Europe, especially former residences, the hallways, and particularly the elevators are small and cramped. This was not a big deal for me, but it could be a problem if you have a lot of large pieces of luggage. Now, on to the good stuff. This hotel is in a very typical metropolitan Parisian neighborhood. While there is plenty of activity; people in and out of local cafes, scurrying through the bakeries and the shoe shop, you do not have the tourist traffic. You really feel like you are part of the city and not just visiting. With all of this activity you might worry that it might be too loud, au contraire. Once you pass through the front gate and make your way to the garden in the back, you wouldn't even know that you were in the heart of the city. Sooo peaceful! I had a fabulous room with large windows that swung open to the garden below and woke to the sound of songbirds in the trees outside. I am serious, I am not making this stuff up! Now, I did have one of the larger rooms in the hotel because it was the only room left (I usually go for the most economical room) but for once I can say that this room really was worth the extra money, which by the way, was not that much more, about 230 Euro. Unfortunately, because I ate all of my meals either at the conference or at dinners afterwards, I did not get a chance to eat at the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to almost anyone.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wolverhampton", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Staff and Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Melissa1989", "ReviewID": "UR125953675", "Content": "I stayed at the Regents Garden for 2 nights as part of a surprise for my partners birthday, we were taken back by the quality of our room (room 203) it was just as depicted in the professional photographs.

We went to the Moulin Rouge one night which was pricey but throughly enjoyable, and also a Bateux Parisiene dinner cruise. The only slight downside was that the people in the next room were quite noisy and we could hear their television, also i did find a few hairs in the bed on our first night.

We chanced upon this lovely quaint hotel from one of our Paris travel guide books \u2013 Frommer's Paris 2011 if I'm not mistaken. As a first time visitor to Paris we wanted to experience both the \u201cLeft Bank\u201d and \u201cRight Bank\u201d hence our decision to stay in 2 different hotels. We stayed here for 3 nights from March14-17. Does \u201cBest Western Premier Regent's Garden\u201d justify its #20 ranking? A resounding YES depending on the experience you are looking for. Location \u2013 Situated in the 17th Arrondissement: which is arguably \u201creal Paris at its wealthiest and finest\u201d. No major tourist attractions here \u2013 we found ourselves nestled in the midst of an upper middle class neighbourhood so every day we got to see local Parisians going to work/ having breakfast/ walking their dogs etc. An almost 10 minute walk to the \u201cCharles de Gaulle-Etoile (CDG-Etoille) metro station/RER urban station\u201d and to Arc de Triomphe and the most famous street on the Right Bank - \u201cChamps Elysee\u201d. A worthwhile point to mention is that the \u201cAir France shuttle bus from Orly Sud (South Exit of Orly airport) that plies Route 1* stops somewhere in front of the CDG-Etoille metro station as its last stop. There is a Carrefour mini market just round the corner from this hotel and a few bakeries nearby \u2013 one opposite the hotel and another within walking distance. Numerous brasseries nearby albeit on the upscale side. External facade \u2013 Lovely and quaint sums up this gem of a hotel. It can be described as a French country mansion in the midst of urban Paris. The charm of this historical mansion would be its well-maintained garden. Guests have the option of having breakfast in its garden which we didn't owing to our late-winter stay. Room- We stayed in a \u201cSuperior Room\u201d - room size was about 20 sq metres with a King size bed. The bed was comfortable with luxurious bedding and duvet. Bathroom came with a bathtub. There was a complimentary welcome platter for making coffee/tea and a packet of biscuit plus complimentary cold drinks in the minibar \u2013 which is something we both appreciated after a long day of sight seeing. The wifi connection was superb \u2013 a plus point as we could immediately upload pics of our sight seeing to family back home. Breakfast \u2013 We didn't try their buffet breakfast (20 euros) as we were more inclined to try the various pastries available at the bakery nearby. Service- The staff were warm and friendly and spoke good English. \u201cBest Western Premier Regent's Garden\u201d is admittedly situated on the rather off-beaten track, but if you are looking at 'Real Paris' of the 'Right Bank' and you want a spacious hotel room(it is spacious by Parisian standards) then this is the hotel for you.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cA gem of a hotel, fantastic staff\u201d", "Author": "Meally", "ReviewID": "UR124290972", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for a 3 nights in early February. The hotel was fantastic, a real home from home. The highlights would be the location, the room but most of all the staff. First, the location is great for exploring Paris. The Charles de Gaulle Etoile station is about a 5 minute walk away and you have a good choice of lines from there. The Arc de Triomphe is a ten minute walk away and dominates the entire area. There is a Carrefour mini-market on the corner about 20 metres from the hotel entrance that has a good selection of most things. Straight across from the hotel is a wonderful boulangerie called Degranges. The fresh croissants and baguettes were a highlight of the trip, and of course the cakes were delicious. The queue out the door on a regular basis showed that the locals valued the place a lot too. There are plenty of places near the hotel to eat and a couple of bars also. We had a room overlooking the garden on the second floor and it was very quiet. We didn\u2019t eat out in the garden as it was never above freezing while we were there but it looks lovely. It also meant that our room was lovely and quiet at all times. There was some redecorating happening on the second floor but it didn\u2019t have any effect on us other than a smell of paint in the hallway. The room was bright and had a decent sized bathroom. There was a very comfortable bath, with a shower in it. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of wardrobe space. Overall, it was the small touches that made the difference: the complimentary drinks in the refrigerator, the bath robes, the safe, the heated towel rail. The free wi-fi and complimentary newspapers in the lobby were a nice touch too. The biggest positive about the hotel was the staff. From the moment we walked through the door to the time we returned for our luggage they were unfailingly friendly, helpful and polite. They really do their best to make your stay enjoyable, from receptionist to porter to chamber maids. Maybe it\u2019s because of the high competition from other hotels in the area but they really have a great attitude and it sets them apart. They helped us print out our boarding cards, gave us extra blankets on one of the colder nights and held onto our luggage after we checked out. Most people would expect that service, as we did, but it was the friendly helpful attitude that stood out. We weren\u2019t an inconvenience to them but a valued guest. The girl Aude who checked us out is a good example, we were checked out quickly and efficiently but also with a smile.

Sadly this left a bad impression for us, we had paid nearly 500 euros for 3 nights, so to insist we pay 30 cents seemed like bad service at the end there.", "Date": "April 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cMarvellous hotel!!

We got an early morning Eurostar to Paris so arrived at the hotel around 11am in the morning.

The room itself, a Superior Room, was spacious (particularly by Parisian standards), clean, nicely decorated and furnished in a style befitting to the period of the property. There was a mini-bar in the room which just had soft drinks in it however these were all available free of charge and there were also tea and coffee making facilities and specialist coffee (at 1 euro each). Other items in the room were the standard toiletry items (flannel, soap, nail file, shower gel etc...) and dressing gowns. Anything we didn't have or was not provided was avilable free of charge at reception. The bed was comfortable so we had a good nights sleep and the breakfast, whilst it probably wouldn't win any prizes, was more than adequate with a good selection of cereals, pastries, bread, fresh fruit, yoghurt, cold meats, cheeses, eggs, sausages, coffee, tea and fruit juice. The service was attentive throughout our stay and they were more than happy to arrange for a taxi to take us to the Gare du Nord when we checked out. The hotels is set back from the road with a courtyard at the front making it more welcoming and it is housed in an attractive period property which makes it ideal for a romantic break. The only downside is that it is a little walk from the nearest metro station (Approx 5 to 10 mins at a steady pace) but still in a pretty good location for the Arc De Triomphe. One of the nicest things about the hotel is that despite being 4 star it was not pretentious which meant that we felt like we could relax during our stay.

Subsequent emails were answered very cordially, and I suspect I was dealing with two different receptionists (one who was very friendly and willing to help, and the other who didn't really care). Luckily we were greeted by the one who did care, because we were shown around the hotel personally, and our room was available well before check-in time, which was a god-send. The room was amazing, tastefully decorated, clean, larger than anything else I had paid the same amount of money for previously, and with the garden view, absolutely perfect, quiet and secluded.

The bathroom was luxurious with marble, bathrobes, towel warmer, etc. They have a computer to use, I sat and uploaded photos each night and Facebooked. Their breakfast (extra charge) looked really good, but I didn't have it because I'm not a sit-down breakfast person.

From the minute I arrived, I knew that I had made the right choice. This hotel is beautiful. There were some very minor renovations still going on, but absolutely nothing that bothered me (like some tape around room numbers while they were painting, which was there one day, gone the next). I never saw any work, or heard anything. I stayed in a standard room, but it was quite large by Paris standards from what I had read on this website. I had a lovely comfortable bed, writing desk, bed side tables, bar fridge and LCD TV. There was a little foyer with a closet in between the bathroom and bedroom. I even had a bath. On request, the hotel provided tea and coffee making which I believe is standard for the bigger rooms. I used my iphone in my room and in the garden with the free wi-fi the hotel provided. There is also a computer with free web access near the lobby. The foyer downstairs was divine, the garden immaculate and I can't rate this hotel high enough. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. What makes this hotel a stand out is the little supermarket, no more than a 20 second walk across the street. It is such a charming place. It's located in the 17th arrondissement, which is quite residential (but Parisian residences are vastly different to Australian so don't be turned off by that). It gave me a real insight into the Parisian culture being in this location. I was a little worried about the hotel being away from all the action when I booked it, but it definitely was not. A lovely short 7 minute walk or so, and you were at the Acr de Triumph, which is at the top of the shopping end of the Champs Elysees. This is a quieter part of Paris, but definitely not away from the action. I will stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat. It made my short 3 day trip to Paris memorable. When I was leaving, a couple of the larger rooms were being cleaned and I had a quick peak. If you have more than a couple of people, or you want to splurge on the bigger room, you will not be disappointed. They were individually decorated and looked spacious and very charming.

The staff were very friendly and good to recommend places to eat, etc. Overall we were very happy with our stay and would highly recommend this hotel", "Date": "March 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cRugby weekend in Paris\u201d", "Author": "sean_e78", "ReviewID": "UR13564334", "Content": "Stayed here recently with my fiance and found the experience fantastic.

The view from the room was great, not only we enjoyed the look at the garden but the rooftops of other parisian houses were very pretty indeed. We had our 2 year old son with us and the travel cot in the room was handy. The best thing about this hotel is its location! It is about 10, 15 minutes walk from Arch de Triomphe and 25, 30 minutes from the Eiffel Tower. Also there is a bakery across the road from the hotel with fresh croissants and a supermarket few steps away. Recommended!

You are actually walking distance to the Arc de Triomphe as the hotel is located on that side of town. Definitely a fantastic hotel location if you don't mind walking a little. The hotel has some historical significance as it used to be a mansion of Napoleon III. So it definitely has a charming look and feel about it. The room we stayed however, was remodeled and had a fairly modern french look about it. Very comfortable room and bed. Free in-room wireless internet and public computer in lobby a big plus. The bathroom was decent size and and had a towel warmer. No complaints there. We stayed in room 309 which seemed to be located near or over the next door restaurant/bar which stays open into late into the morning. You can hear chairs being pushed in and out and maybe shoes with heels walk across the wooden floors of the restaurant. May bother you if you are a light sleeper. We walked so much during our stay that at night, we usually slept right through it. The neighborhood in which this hotel is located is great. There is a market and p\u00e2tisserie right across the street. Both very nice and convenient. Tons of cafes and shops in the nearby area. The hotel staff was very helpful and spoke good english.

I had only planned to stay a few days but because of the staff, location, comfort and feeling of the hotel, I stayed for ten days and then came back in November! The accommodations were excellent. On my first trip, I ended up staying in four different rooms as they accommodated my extra days and they were all lovely. The bathrooms are exceptional( I am very picky!) and the beds are very comfortable. The staff is seasoned and very personal. The little dining room for breakfast is adorable.

We stayed at Best Western Premier Regent's Garden the whole week. The Hotel is old, but well maintained. They have a secured small parking spaces in front of the hotel. The reception stuff speaks english and are very friendly and helpful. The room we were in was small - which is a standard size for Paris. The room and bathroom are clean. Our room faces the street and across the street is a contstruction and it get really loud and noisy with all the drilling and hammering. At night time, we could here the cars on the street, the honking and motorcyle -- a bit loud. Breakfast is not included with the room fee, so you have to pay an extra 12-15 Euros per person, so we decided to walk a few meters up the mainstreet and viola . . . . we found several Boulangerie/Patisserie with excellent bread/pastries/croissants and they also offer petite dejouner. The Hotel is average, nothing spectacular . . . we were out most of the time so we only use the hotel for sleeping. There is a Grocery across the street which is very convinient to buy some drinks and snacks. There is also Boulangerie/Patisserie and Asian food take out. The location of the hotel is pretty convinient . . . the metro (if it was operating normally) is only 10 minutes walk. Etoile and Champs Ellesey are also only 10 minutes walk. We will probably stay at this Hotel again . . . mainly because of the location. The Train/Metro strike started the second day we arrived in Paris -- this was a disaster. We have been in Paris 7 times the past 8 years and we never had this strike experience before. Metro is very important to get around Paris. Ohhh .... what a catastrophe. But we decided to enjoy Paris with or without Metro and we had a great time despite of it all. The worst part was that, we purchased the 5 day Visite Paris -- unlimited Metro ride for 5 days for \u20ac 27.00 per piece and we did not even use it. The Metro clerk did not even informed us of the strike when we bought the tickets -- oh, well ce'st la vie!

Compared to our only other Paris hotel experience 35 years ago, this hotel provided much more luxurious surroundings and a very courteous, attentive staff. We had a quiet room that overlooked the rear garden. The carpeting, tile WC and separate tile shower/bath appeared to have been upgraded recently. The Arc de Triomphe is only about 1/2 mile away, but it is uphill all the way! I recommend using the Ternes metro station if you want to go the the Arc de Triomphe (Charles DeGaulle Etoille Metro) or Museums beyond. On your short walk to or from Ternes Metro, you will walk by one of the best outdoor markets in Paris, where you can pick up fresh bread, cheese, pastry, smoked fish, vegetables, fruit and inexpensive wine for your evening meat in your hotel room. We can recommend the L'Orenoc, Spoon, and Chez Georges restaurants from personal experience. These restaurants are within walking distance of the hotel or Charles DeGaulle Etoille Metro stop. My only disappointment was that the free hotel WiFi Internet connection blocked two of my U.S. email providers, Verizon and Compuserve. Fortunately I had a third email site available that was not blocked. Also, my favorite web browser, Mozilla Firefox, did not work there.

We highly recommend the hotel. We stayed in a Queen-Garden View Room on top floor (3rd floor). The room was spacious by European standards. The bed was large....more like a King size....reasonably comfortable. Washroom was also fairly large with combination tub/shower. The room was very clean. A/C worked well and was quiet. Room comes with bar fridge and safe. Apart from the size of the room, the best thing about the hotel room was how quiet it was. In 6 nights we hardly heard a sound. Staff was courteous. Free computer/internet in the lobby (The hotel guide in the room advised that there was a charge for the lobby internet. However, we used it on several occassions and were not charged.) Two small nits: No kettle tea/coffee in room....although you could ask for a tea/coffee tray free-of-charge at the front desk. Elevator is small. But that's standard for most hotels in Europe. The hotel is located in the 17th Arr.; a 10 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe. Three Metro stations are within a 10 minute walk: Porte Maillot; Charles de Gaulle Etoile (aka Arc de Triomphe) and Ternes. The first two stations also have access to the RER. So while there are few sights close by the hotel....you have easy access to transit. We took the Air France Bus from CDG to Charles de Gaulle Etoile....20 Euros return....took about 45 minutes....with a 10 minute walk from there to the hotel. We didn't try the breakfast in the hotel.

This was the first time I stayed at the Regent's Garden, and I will make it my favourite from now on. I had booked a Queen's Room with garden view for a little more than 100 EUR. I am not sure if I actually got an upgrade, because the room I got (on the top floor) was the spaciest I have ever seen in this city, where the standard is to be crammed into some tiny space where little else than the bed fits in. The view to the garden was not really overwhelming, but pleasant. Totally quite, except some occasional noise from what I guess was the elevator. I could easily cope with that. The decor was nice, what you might call typically Parisian, as in the rest of the hotel. The garden is a great feature, very rare in Paris. Staff was friendly and efficient, and really everybody speaks English - they not only know it, they actually speak it, which is also not typical for France. Highspeed internet for free in the lobby. I am not sure about internet in the rooms since I did not bring my notebook. The only real downside was the breakfast buffet, which at 14 EUR is wildly overpriced. Choice is rather limited, and they even charge you extra for scrambled eggs and the like. When I came in short before closing on the last morning, there was hardly anything left, but I still paid the 14 EUR. While it is certainly very nice to have your breakfast in the garden, you will get much better value outside. What I liked, however, was the \"fair trade\" tea and coffee which I have very seldom seen at any hotel. The location is OK but not exciting, in a mid- to upscale residential neighbourhood with little of interest. It is about 10-15 min walk to the Arc de Triomphe. If you want to stay close to the main tourist attractions, this is probably not the optimal choice, but anyway the metro system is so efficient it does not really matter where you are located.
