We stayed there for several days. and also stayed in a couple of other hotels. I should say right away this one was the best of the three. Positive: 1. It is very new 2. Normal-size rooms (which is really unusual for London). 3. Breakfast bar is very good (rolls (croissants), jams, cold cereal, fruit, yogurt, hot tea, coffee,...) and is very filling. Also you can upgrade breakfast for a bit of money to include sausage links and other hot dishes. But after eating the upgraded version the first morning I realized that I could not eat that much again! But it was delicious either way. 4. Located not far from underground 5. Located next door to the biggest mall in Europe - Westfield mall. It is a brand new mall and it is huge! It has an outstanding food court with some ethnic cafes and has a grocery store or two as well as all kinds of department stores. 6. The staff is very friendly 7. Clean 8. ATM in the lobby 9. Wi-fi connection (though some folks had troubel with it) and you can buy time on the computer in the lobby. 10. The neighborhood felt safe. 11. The Olympic stadium and the abstract Olympic statue is nearby. Negative: Some students in our group had to share a bed and said that the bed was slanted towards the middle. But I was in a single room and loved my room very much.

There is still the problem with parking charges (not PI's fault, I guess), but you can make it cheaper if you're prepared to move your car regularly. You just drive out and turn back into the same car park. The point here being that the first two hours are free and it's only \u00a32 for after 6pm to before 8 am. If you just leave your car sat there for 24 hrs+ you'll get stung for an eye-watering \u00a326. Ouch. Still the problem with room temp. being too hot in our opinion. Can't open the windows and the air con was a bit feeble. Kids had problem getting off to sleep, as did my wife. Best views from odd number rooms on higher floors, but the other side is nice too. Don't expect to be given close-together rooms just because you might have booked 2 at the same time, in the same name. Shopping is great, breakfast even better. High quality ingredients, well cooked. Can't imagine there's a better deal in the UK when you have 2 kids free per adult...i.e. \u00a37 something for 3 magnificent breakfasts. Sorry, just drooled on keyboard. We saved a bit by eating marked-down Waitrose sandwhiches on the Sunday night. 45p for chicken and bacon!! Become available at about 4.30 onwards!! Quality of the rooms and interior in general still very high.. more 5* than 'budget'. Staff really nice. We got it at \u00a339 per room which is very good value indeed.

I had a family room on the 10th floor with amazing views of the Olympic Park & other landmarks, and my Mum had a double room, also on the 10th floor, all very new and perfect. My bathroom was a decent size, with bath & shower, plenty of shelf space & sparkling clean. As promised, the bed was really comfortable, and extra pillows were provided. The heating/air conditioning system was excellent, probably the best I have ever encountered in a hotel. I appreciated having the means to make a cup of tea, and I was able to ask for an iron and board to be delivered to my room. We ate breakfast in the hotel every morning - if you have not already pre-booked it, you can just pay for it on the day. The full cooked breakfast was excellent - they will cook eggs, porridge or veggie sausages to order (I had poached eggs on toast) and you help yourself to everything else, as much as you want! After a few days we switched to the continental breakfast - loads of different cereals which you can customise with dried fruits/seeds, plus croissants, crumpets, toast, muffins, fresh fruit & yoghurts. My Mum reported that the coffee was very good! One night we went for the hotel's Meal Deal - a 3 course meal with wine AND a full breakfast the next morning for \u00a322 which was great value (I had the rump steak, cooked to medium-rare perfection!). I loved the location - attached to a great shopping centre (Waitrose & loads of lovely food stalls right next door for those in-room munchies!), directly opposite Stratford International station and a 5 minute walk through the centre to Stratford tube for the Central Line and Overground trains. But best of all, I loved the staff - they were all charming and helpful, and obviously took pride in giving great customer service. A real credit to their employers.

The bar and restaurant area was very modern and comfortable and again, much more than you would expect at a budget hotel. The unlimited breakfast is a great bargain, doubly so when kids eat for free- it is amazing how much 12 year olds can put away! Only one constructive criticism was that the bar was understaffed on both nights. The hotel was obviously 100% full and service was extremely slow as the bar staff were also on duty for the restaurant.

On the occasion we booked a double room over two nights, the first night went failry well. The next morning we left round about 8am and clearled the room hoping that upon our return we will find a cleaned room. This was not the case when we came back for the evening at around 9 pm. The floor was clearly not hooverd and pieces of paper were evident on the dusty carpet. Glasses that we had used the previous night were still unchanged on the table where we left them. The bathroom wasalso dirty and unmoped with no evidence of any effort at cleaning whatsoever.We appreciate as Premier Inn suggests we could re-use our bed linen and towels , but the utmost disregard for even the most basic of room service was trully astounding. Because it was already late anyway when we came we did'nt bother calling reception to 'fixit' as this would have caused us unnecessary inconvience at that hour. As an asthmatic I kept sneezing all night from the clearly dusty environment I and my fiance found ourselves in. This continued right to the next morning when we finally checked out. To compound our already nasty experience , when we reported our concerns to the lady at reception (Lucie) she seemed clearly unbortherd and dimissive and seemed less intertested in hearing what we had to say showing an atitude similar to the one conveyed by her colleague (a bearded gentleman who walked away from the post and clearly disinterested in what we were sayingto his colleage when my fiance was still talking). The behaviour of the two made us feel unvalued and falls below the high standardswe have experienced in other Premier Inns in the past.With the Olympics coming to the East end I hope such shoddy service and customer service will be fixed.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lichfield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cI'll be back!!\u201d", "Author": "1609MikeM51", "ReviewID": "UR125280410", "Content": "Had an overnight in double room for Olympic Test Event.

When the order came 15 min later the meal came as standard, no large chips with pees and grilled tomatoes. I asked them why r they serving me this and the waitress said that there is probably a misunderstanding in the kitchen a she took my plate away and I had to wait another 10 min to get it back. Meanwhile I also ordered another glass of wine and it came when I was just about to finish my mixed grill. While all that chaos was happening around there was a waitress which was not even thought to walk properly as she was walking to the kitchen every time I was having the feeling that there is an earthquake. Ordered the desert and it came fairly quick (bout 5 min) and this time was the right thing. When I requested the bill I had to wait for about 10 min and when it arrived it was wrong, they tried to charge me for 3 glasses of wine rather than two and for two LARGE mixed grills.

A short walk through the shopping centre takes you to the Stratford station with Tube, Overland,Mainline trains & the Docklands Light Railway all merging into one brand new station. Yet the hotel was so quiet. Spotlessly clean. Parking is at the Westfield Stratford shopping centre, It cost me just over \u00a350 for parking Sat, Sun, Mon & most of Tuesday in a very secure park. Checking in is on the first floor so you enter the hotel & get the lift up one floor. I did find that one evening I entered the Hotel & around 8 men where what looked like they were loitering which made me a tad uneasy though nothing at all happened. I would reccomend the pub on Westfield, The Cow very upmarket pub food. Jamies Italian was also good. Too many to try them all. Overall this is a very good place to stay.

As there was myself, my husband and my 15 year old son, this represented great value. Many London hotels are only for two or kids are classed as under 12. We arrived at Liverpool Street Station so great to jump on the Central line straight to Stratford. We got to Stratford just before 10pm so shops were shut, therefore it was easy to get through mall with luggage. As other reviewers have said it is a decent walk but that was ok for us. Also, as others had said it was hard to find I rang the hotel the day before to let them know we would be a late check-in and get directions. I was told the entrance was on the ground floor-it is in fact on the lower ground floor but this is the level you enter the mall on from the tube. It is past Waitrose and follow signs for car park A. Turn right instead of entering car park and go around the corner to entrance.Do use the lift between the entrance and reception as it is 25 metres up with over a hundred stairs.Couldn't use self-serve check-in but was checked in really quickly at desk. Room was on fourth floor-all brand spanking new and this made the price we paid even better value-there was a bath instead of just a shower which was lovely to be able to have a soak after lots of walking. There was a soap dispenser for the sink and body wash for the bath, both of which were well-known and popular brands. We had taken our own toiletries as I didn't expect there to be any, but used these too. We went straight down to bar as food was served until 10.30pm. Bar food prices were reasonable- about six pounds for paninis and baguettes, add a bowl of chips for 1.50. Food was fresh, hot and tasty. Had ice and water from the bar to take to our room. Key card operated the lift from Reception to rooms which made us feel safe. Rang Reception to ask for an extra mug, towels and milk-they were sent up very quickly. Only asked for one key card but needed a second one on the second night when hubby and son went to cinema-this card didn't work properly so was changed at Reception.Missed breakfast on the first morning by the time we'd had a lie-in and all had a shower. Lots of places to eat in mall, so this wasn't a problem. However, next day had breakfast in the hotel-very busy and had to queue. As breakfast was served till 11am and it was getting close to that I asked George who was on the till if we would still be able to get everything. He explained that as it was so busy the chef would keep cooking until everyone had eaten. It was difficult for the staff to keep up with replacing everything-bowls, plates, juices and cooked items but they worked really hard and some people may have got annoyed but hey it's half term weekend so it's just best to be patient and understand that the staff can only do so much. Without exception, all the staff at this hotel were pleasant, sociable and an absoulute credit to the company they work for. We are quite well-travelled both in the UK and abroad and quite honestly I cannot give enough praise both to the staff and this hotel in general. I would recommend it to others without hesitation-just remember it is not a central London location but within easy reach. The mall has everything you could need-we shopped here for clothes for our son, ate on our first morning, went to the cinema, bought drinks for our room and food for while we were on the move and our journey home from Waitrose and Greggs. Whilst there is still a lot of building work going on around the hotel we weren't disturbed by this at all. We all slept well in our comfy beds, my son even wanted to take a pillow home with him!

As we ( me and hubby) dont mind walking ok no problem but we took the inlaws and they are in there 70s and struggled with the trek from one end of the shopping centre to the other with bags. On arrival we had to check in on touch screens that were not at all sensitive and took some doing for the three rooms individually,someone did eventually did come to the rescue. We then decided to have a quick snack of nachos they took 45mins and eventually showed up burnt with grated cheese not melted. To be fair we complained and we got an apology and a refund. So we left there to contine our journey to o2 which should have been simple but of course another trek through the shopping centre to get the jubilee line,just before we left we asked how do we get back to the hotel later when westfield is closed we were assured he doors would be open. Guess what on our return following others doing the same thing back through the shopping centre yep the front doors where open but alas the end doors shut we were like a load od sheep we then turned round and tried the next floor thank god that was open otherwise would have had to go round outside of building. After finally getting to hotel a nice relaxing drink in the bar would have been great instead the very small bar area(god knows how they will cope when the games are on)was full with really rowdy groups drinking themselves stupid with shots, lovely so we were forced to retire to our room with a drink bought from the bar.

We had two large bags each and two suitcase carry-ons as well. We took the National Express bus from the Stanstead airport which drops you off not too far from the front of the mall. What I didn't know was that it was going to be about 1/4-1/2 mile walk either through the mall or around the mall through the outside shops. I wish I had known this and I might have gotten a taxi. The entrance is in the back of the mall across from Stratford International train station. From the underground you need to walk all the way through the mall till you see Waitrose grocery store.

You have to take the elevator to the reception area. Reception was quick and painless and the people very friendly. Internet is 3 pounds a day or 10 pounds for a week's worth (you get a code on a card). You can share this card between a family or friends in the same room. Rooms are somewhat small but we had a nice view of the Olympic Stadium. Bed was super comfy. Food- We didn't eat the breakfast because 8 pounds works out to be 13 dollars a person for Americans and we didn't want to spend $26 on breakfast. McDonald's and Subway are open inside the mall for breakfast and both of us together had breakfast for 7 pounds. There are many many other restaurants in the mall during the day, I recommend \"Tortilla\" it is a Mexican place (Intl food court) reasonably priced that is like a \"Chipotle Mexican Grill\" and the Chicago Rib place had decent ribs but not with a sit-down price.

Such a small thing but it made us feel special. Like other visitors we probably would have struggled to find the hotel but there's an information point just inside the Westfields shopping centre and we simply asked there and found the hotel no problem. We came on the Circle line tube from St Pancras and had no problems getting to the hotel. We took the high speed train into London one day just to check it out but it's cheaper and more fun to catch the tube, probably quicker too as you can get a direct tube into the city centre without having to go to St Pancras, where the high speed train goes to. The Westfield Centre had a fantastic selection of food outlets and restaurants; they've really gone for the Olympic theme with food from all over the world - only problem you might have is trying to decide where to eat. There's also a cinema and casino and one of the restaurants even has ten pin bowling lanes.

In no way do I mean it in a negative manner. This hotel was by far the cheapest of the well known brands within London. I stayed with my wife for her birthday, and the criteria for the hotel, was for it be located in either zone 1 or as close as possible to it and in a quiet location. The latter is going to be rare in London. This hotel was in zone 3. Its a slight problem, but not a major issue. For the difference in price, I think the distance is compensated for. It is very quiet, but may not be during the olympics. The hotel isn't a 5 star hotel, and no way does it try to be. It is very clean, very quiet and just like any other Premier Inn hotel. No issues with the hotel. The room The room itself was clean, well maintained, in a good condition of repair. Just what you'd expect. No moans about the room, besides a couple, which is personal to myself, therefore will not be mentioned on here. Premier Inn have been made aware of it. Despite the smokescreen I have left above, it does not detract from me ever staying at a Premier Inn hotel, and nor should it stop others. I have stayed on numerous occasions, and this would be by far the best room/hotel I have stayed in, within the Premier Inn hotels. Really couldn;t complain about the room. Food Only had breakfast, which was satisfactory. Not as good as other breakfasts I have had at other Premier Inn hotels. The buffer bar, for the first time I have seen unmanned. Other Premier Inn hotels, (in which I have stayed at), have always been manned. Not a gripe, just an observation. The buffet bar seemed to have less choice than other Premier Inn hotels. Maybe a company policy change, or just this hotel. Food was not great, but for the price, it was OK. Staff Cannot fault the staff at all. All very polite, well dressed, approachable. Not much more to say about the staff. Didn't need to speak to them about any problems/faults, so cannot say how they would react or respond when things aren't as smooth running. Overall, the Premier Inn Stratford is good. Not great, as I believe you need to be a good 5 star hotel to achieve a 'great'. Its location is ok, if your prepared to catch and underground and a DLR, at the minimum to get it, and still a 2 minute walk from the station. Its right next to the Westfield Stratford shopping centre, which is massive, and has pretty much everything you need, in terms of retail/clothing/banking etc etc etc. I'd definately stay at this, or any other Premier Inn hotel again. Its probably a definate if you have young kids.

We asked for a view of the stadium and were given a lovely room on the 8th floor with amazing views. There were 2 singles and 1 double bed (all ready made-up) which was better than some other higher-priced hotels that sometimes give you 1 double and one sofa bed for a family of 4.

The breakfast staff were all lovely and were great with the children. The quality of the food was excellent and although we did not take dinner in the hotel, I would certainly try it next time.

The hotel was not at all busy, there were many staff with nothing to do, however after a member of staff slowly pondered for 20 minutes what he could do with us, we were left waiting for the manager for just over 20 minutes. who then just asked my boyfriend to have a fax sent over from his office, as if it would still be open at 7.30pm! By this time we'd been there over an hour and we had a dinner cruise booked for 8.30pm. Lo and behold as they were stalling so much I had to take my suitcase and change my clothes, wash and attempt to make myself look half decent for my birthday dinner cruise in their public toilets!!! Not nice for a girl on her birthday!!! I was totally appalled at the service, we were not at all taken care of, we were left standing there while staff just walked round in circles having the occasional chat. When it became apparent it was to late to now get the train to the dinner cruise, we asked one member of staff if she could please phone a taxi and explained it was urgent. She strolled - slower than a snail - over to the phone, picked it up and went to dial, then someone entered the room that she recognised, she looked over to me and put the phone down before begginning to have a very long chat with the girl who was clearly an aquaintance of hers. After 10 more minutes we asked another staff member to call us a taxi which he did so. The girl returned 20 minutes after we origionally asked her for our URGENT taxi and very rudely asked \"Where did ya want that taxi to again?\" BY THIS POINT I WAS FUMING! We had to leave our bags with management to go to the dinner cruise, and returned at 1am and spoke to a different manager - Sam I believe his name was - who was fair and gave us one night free and free breakfast. He was brilliant in comparison to the other staff members we had encountered - particularly the girl we asked to make the phonecall, she was so rude! Aside from all the hassle and stress our room was fine, apart from when I entered the bathroom and the door handle fell off leaving me in danger of being locked in. The breakfast presented a good choice of food, I like the fact that they use Yeo Valley organic yoghurts - good choice! Basically you wouldn't have this kind of issue with a smaller, family run hotel or guesthouse as they are flexible and care about their clients generally - whereas this Premier Inn seems to have a extremely 'computer says no' attitude.

We reserved two beds, but when we got to the room there was only one bed. Calling down to the front desk they said they would send someone up to give us keys to another room with two beds. 30 minutes later no one came, so we went back down to the front desk. We got a new room and when we entered again no second bed, but a sofa. Calling down again confused, they said the sofa was made into a bed. Housekeeping came about 15 minutes later and put a sheet and pillow on the sofa. It is not large but can fit one person. Breakfast was delicious definately worth the price and dinner was good as well. We had booked the dinner/breakfast combo for all three days but we decided to not use this on the last day and getting refunded became quite a hassle and confusing process. The credit went to a different room and receptionist kept asking a receipt which was never given to me, because they like to email it to you directly. After about an hour of working through getting a refund we were successful but was quite time consuming. The area the hotel is in is great as there are lots of dining and shopping options. The transit is also wonderful as it is on the tube and has a train that goes right to St. Pancreas. So fast and cheap to get from the Eurostar to the hotel.

We found the hotel easily as we had done some prior research to find out which car park was closest to the hotel (car park A). We soon found a space as on each level had a board telling you how many spaces were available per level and they also had lights on the roof next to each space that changed colour as to the availability of a space, green for available and red for taken. We entered the hotel on the ground floor and then went up to the first floor in the lift where the reception and the restaurant are located. They have lectern style check in desks and they both had customers at them being served so we used the self-check in units behind the two desks. The self-check in was an ok but we had to input details of all four of us and the machine also issued four keys. It would have been better if we could have been asked how many keys we required and why they need all of the people names in the room. I have stayed in many hotels and only premier inn ask the names of all of the occupants. We made our way up to our room on the 9th floor, we had a good view over looking the station and forthcoming Olympic site but we had an even numbered room, I think if you have an odd numbered room you will be over looking the stadium with central London behind. The room was nice and understated. Premier Inn seemed to have toned down the purple and brown wood branding into something a bit more contempory; there were white and beige walls with a painting on the wall. We stayed in one of their older properties last year and the room did look quite old fashioned. The room also had air conditioning, which was a bonus. The room was a good but not over generous size with a king size bed and two separate beds for the children all lined up next to one another, like one massive bed. There wasn\u2019t much noise apart from the high speed trains going along the rail link to Europe about every hour or so. There is quite a lot of constriction around the site at the moment but the railway track was between the athlete\u2019s village and us so we didn\u2019t get any noise from the there. We had dinner at Giraffe restaurant; one of many in the Westfield centre, there is lots of choice there so you don\u2019t have to dine in the hotels restaurant. The hotel is part of the complex but you still have to go outside for about 25 meters to get inside so you still may need a coat if it was very cold or raining as you will get wet if it is raining. It would have been better if you could gain access without going outside like so many shopping malls in North America. We all had a good sleep, as there were blackout curtains in the room and nice comfy beds. The breakfast was good and fairly good value at \u00a37.99 each for adults with under 16\u2019s eating for free. I don\u2019t know how easy it is to get into central London by tube but if you are planning to leave your car there you will be charged all the time the car is parked. Our charge for 21 hours was \u00a314.00 with allegedly two hours free parking and a \u00a32.00 overnight charge; I did not get a receipt so the charging structure is a bit of a mystery. The hotel does not have its own car park so you will park with all of the shoppers. The staff were all very good and very professional and the hotel easy to get to. I would recommend this hotel for its ease of access by car and the additional shops, restaurants and leisure activities (cinema, ten pin bolwing, ice rink in winter & a really good free Santa\u2019s grotto) if you need to be in East London and can get a good rate.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cPerfect London Base for a Mini Break!\u201d", "Author": "JulesMcC78", "ReviewID": "UR121945320", "Content": "We stayed with the hotel for 3 nights over the last weekend in December before Christmas and we had a great stay. We wanted somewhere that had good transport access and as we would be out and about we didn't need to spend needless pennies on accommodation to be in the heart of the city. The location was easy to get to, we flew in from Stanstead, took the National Express coach which drops you off at the main Westfields entrance, easy! You can then either walk round the side of the centre to the hotel ot through the shopping mall like we did, if you do that aim for the John Lewis/Waitrose side of the centre. The centre is mammoth and it took us a moment to get our bearings. You can exit the centre on the ground floor close to the Waitrose entrance and head to the right, the Premier Inn Entrance is just outside. We arrived earlier than the check-in time and met by really lovely check in staff who were happy to take our bags for us and store them until we came back. So it was easy to have a shop wander, grab some food then go back to check-in. We made a request to be in a room with a view of the Olympic Stadium etc and the staff were glad to assist. For reference the odd room numbers have the view and our's was excellent, we were on the 10th floor. Our room was perfect for our stay, not lots of clothing storage but to be honest no big problem there. Bathroom was a good size too and was well maintained. On the whole clean, tidy and ideal for what we needed. The public areas of the hotel were really nice and plesant to sit in. We didn't do breakfast in the hotel but did grab a pizza and some drinks on one night and it hit the spot! Really liked that they had a nice festive drinks menu and again the staff made sure they checked that we were happy with everything we had. During the stay the staff couldn't have been more accommodating or helpful, all seemed happy to be there which always helps in the hospitality industry!! Transport wise, the rail/underground links were great, access to the DLR and the central line. Stratford station is approx 5/10 min walk through the mall, it doesn't feel long at all as like me you'll probably be window shopping en route!

It was uncomfortable for more than an overnight stay, rather claustrophobic, with a very narrow window, low ceiling and not enough space for Lenny Henry to swing a cat! Even the bed seemed smaller than in other Premier Inns. The 2nd room was also a bit cramped for a family. The cot we booked was in a small space by the window. In trying to move the over-long net curtain to keep our grandchild safe while letting her see out of the window, the curtain pole sprang loose and hit me in the head causing swelling & bruising that took 3 weeks to subside. The fact that this could have happened to a small child - or pierced my eye, which it just missed - concerned me greatly. I spoke to a member of staff who promised to notify the management. She was friendly, efficient and prompt in offering a full refund. None of us had slept as a result of the shock of the accident and the overheating. However, no-one contacted me subsequently to check that I had recovered fully or to reassure us that steps would be taken to fix the sprung-loaded curtain tracks properly to avoid injury to other clients. The midweek prices are often over \u00a3100, which, for staying next to a (current) building site and shopping centre with teething problems, feels a bit steep in view of the advertising strap-line that implies high quality but budget pricing. However, if you can book one of the cheap deals, enjoy shopping centres, don't need to use what can be expensive parking and are assigned one of the larger family rooms which isn't overheated, it could be a much better experience than we had.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cPremier Inn - very good\u201d", "Author": "PaddyJoe", "ReviewID": "UR121388484", "Content": "We stayed on 4th floor and had no problem with noise.

The reception is actually on the first floor, which is fine - it stops pesky people who shouldn't be there from going in. Got to the hotel about 2pm, and the room still wasn't ready - but that was fine, they took my bags and put to storage and informed me that it would be maybe 30 minutes or so and showed me the bar for a snack/drink. Prices were pretty good considering it's a hotel. The bar staff even informed me that it was cheaper to get 3 bottles of beer instead of 2 (deal running at the time) which was polite. When my room was ready, a member of staff came over to let us know that it was ready when we were ready to check in... They had 3-4 express check-in machines, which was very simple to use, had a member of staff right behind me in case something went wrong during this process - painless. It's about 15 minutes from everything in central London, and on the Central Line for ease. In the same lobby on the first floor, there are 3 vending machines - one for drinks (bottles of coke etc), one for snacks and cans of drink and and the top of one it had some items you may have forgotten, e.g. toothbrush/toothpaste (pack), shaving foam and razor and so on - didn't need it, but it was good to know if something was missed. I used the advice that I read on here, getting a room facing the shopping centre - there was pure silence, good for my partner who is a light sleeper. The room was pretty big, it was a family room marked as a room for two... So we even had the 3rd single bed there :) Room was spotless with plenty of room. The house keeping staff were also very polite and cheerful when we walked past - always asking how our days were, and if we were having a good stay and such! As I'm a bit of a nerd, and tech buff - one of the first things I looked at was the TV! TV was showing Freeview channels and were Samsung TVs and did indeed have a USB port and HDMI port free on the back, which was handy as I could plug my hard drive in to watch TV/Movies. My only gripe, was the location/sign posting... We walked past the side of John Lewis went around, and there was a huge flight of stairs - down here is an Entrance to the Car Park and to the right the shopping centre, it's around the corner from here - but there was no sign posts anywhere helping people to find it.

The room would of cost \u00a3103.00 which is pretty steep, but was in a good location however thanks to their offer it was free. We were in the Stratford area at around 5:30pm but thanks to the hotel being new and on a new road in the Olympic Park no sat nav or Google Maps could pick up the address. After ages finding the entrance to the shopping centre we parked up and went in and asked the touch screen machine where it was. Even after that we were confused. It was round a corner outside, behind the shopping centre. Once in, we were greeted with a warm welcome and checked in swiftly. Our room was 414 facing the train station and general grounds of the Olympic Park (not the stadium, however). The room itself was nice enough I suppose, the bathroom was small but clean and there was plenty of storage space. We booked a family room with a main double bed and single bed in the corner. We returned from dinner at around 9.00 exhausted and went to bed. First of all, the room was very hot as was most of the hotel so it took ages to get the room to a decent temperature. After over an hour it was getting cooler but still warm. The problem was the beds were very hard. Not at all like any other Premier Inn I have stayed in. Perhaps because the hotel was new, it was very uncomfortable, coupled with the fact that the pillows were lumpy as well. After 3 hours of trying to sleep and it was quarter to one in the morning, it was clear we wern't getting any sleep so decided to pack up and drive 90 mins back down to Brighton, to home where we could get a proper night's sleep. Thank goodness we didn't pay \u00a3103.00 to stay here! After what seemed an age trying to check out with one member of staff, going to fetch another to try and cancel breakfast for the following morning and all the fuss with that, it was 1:30 in the morning and by the time we got home and got to sleep it was gone half 3. So summed up - if you are used to hard, lumpy beds then you should be alright staying here, but we found it awfully uncomfortable and we couldn't get a good nights sleep, as well as the fact it was far too warm, no matter what you did.

First off, getting there is a doddle, Circle or Jubilee line to Stratford City, and a reasonably short walk through Westfield towards the Waitrose end (note: it gets busy in the evenings). Or take the DLR to Stratford International (which exits at the hotel door!) Sorry, I can't comment on parking or driving through the miriad of building works going on for 2012. This is a great base for exploring London, why pay \u00a3100+ a night more to be central when this is just a tube ride away? Well, the tube does get very busy and if you can't stand for more than 30 minutes you might want to look elsewhere for accomodation, but that's London. You might find the DLR a little less congested, but I can't really comment. The hotel itself was only 4 weeks old when we visted and it is very nice for a budget hotel. I must admit I am a little biased, I like PI, I know pretty much what I'm going to get before I arrive and I know I'll be able to sleep on the \"strange\" bed. When travelling with family, it's nice to be able to sleep in the same room and the cost doesn't ruin your weekend. Stratford is no exception, if anything, it's a little better, it had the feel of a business class hotel, like a decent Hilton. We had a great room with fantastic views of the Olympic stadium and pool, It was again, as expected, clean and with good air con. although I find the milk tubes they provide for tea and coffee a little miserly. The restaurant is not the usually attached pub, but a proper hotel restaurant. There are some great views of the Olympic village and the staff are superb. I really can't praise the staff enough. From entering the lobby (on the first floor) you are greeted with warmth and genuine good nature. I was genuinely interested in the Olympic works going on and everyone I asked could impart a little snippet of information. I was really impressed on our last morning when it looked like the whole hotel had come down to breakfast at the same time. The restaurant manager was very apologetic and the staff very helpful, we still managed to have a very enjoyable breakfast, without feeling the stress that the staff were obviously under. Well done you guys! My only critisisms would be 1) the lifts seem to take for ever, they seem to always go to the top floor before coming back down. Maybe it's me, but I did have to wait 12 minutes to get a lift back to my room one morning - they did come, but were always full! and 2) No free wifi - this is the 21 Century.

I have stayed there on 3 occasions and have always been impressed by the friendly service and obvious cleanliness with it being new. The rooms are standard Premier Inn fair and none the worse for that. Everything is new and fresh with comfortable beds and functional bathrooms. The flat screen televisions have access to all UK Freeview channels and many radio stations. You could never describe the hotel as luxurious but it is comfortable enough and I would make special mention of the staff who are very friendly and helpful. You may want to try for a high room (floors 7-10) on the south side of the building to benefit from some very good views over London. There is some construction work for the Olympic site (next door) and so there is a little noise but I didn\u2019t find it too intrusive. The hotel did have one or two teething troubles as might be expected. The self check-in facility now works fine it would seem. However, when my air conditioning did not work for example, I was immediately offered a full refund for that night\u2019s accommodation as the hotel was full. Excellent customer service indeed. As has been mentioned, it takes a little finding if you\u2019re coming by underground. Basically, get off the underground at Stratford and head for the Westfield Shopping centre. It\u2019s about a 10 minute walk through the shopping centre at a leisurely pace or with luggage. You need to walk right through the ground floor of the shopping centre to get to the hotel. You\u2019ll pass Marks & Spencer on your left and keep walking past the food court on your left until you see Waitrose (handy for essential supplies). Then head out of the shopping centre doors and you\u2019ll see the hotel. The West End is around 25 minutes away on the Central Line. Stratford International Rail Station is much closer to the hotel and a train from there gets you to Kings Cross/St Pancras in less than 10 minutes. There is a restaurant and bar one in the hotel which offers UK pub-style food for less than \u00a310. A walk into the adjacent Westfield Centre (open until 9pm on weekdays) offers a food court on the ground floor with a range of fast food restaurants such as KFC, McDonalds, Subway, Chinese, Caribbean etc. Venture upstairs in the Centre and there\u2019s an even bigger choice of restaurants with everything from the usual chain restaurants to Thai and Japanese cuisine. The Shopping Centre itself has a fantastic range of designer and chain stores. All in all then, a good choice balancing value for money and comfort if you don\u2019t mind being a little out of town or are visiting either the Olympic Stadium or Westfield Shopping Centre. I fully recommend it on that basis.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle", "Title": "\u201cPremier Inn\u201d", "Author": "LandD2009", "ReviewID": "UR119481540", "Content": "I stayed at the premier inn in Stratford for 2 nights whilst on business at the Olympic Park.

A colleague of mine had stayed at the hotel two weeks before and had told me that the hotel was a little difficult to find. When we got there we did have to ask a couple of people for directions before we found it. Follow these directions and you will find the hotel in no time: Coming out of the tube follw the Westfield Stratford City signs, enter the shopping centre on the left and walk straight down that floor until you see the Great Eastern Market/Waitrose. Turn right and out of the doors and Premier Inn will either be on your right or left side, depending on which exit you come out of. In terms of where we wanted to stay in London, Premier Inn was the cheapest at \u00a3118 for two nights and we booked it from their website. When we got there we found out we were on the second floor and as it was a birthday trip, asked if we could have a room on a higher floor. The lady who served us was very helpful and accomodating and not only gave us a room on a higher floor, but gave us a room on the very top floor, the 10th floor! We were very happy as you can imagine. The room had a great view of the Olympics Stadium and two other venues, one being the Aquatics Centre. The hotel offers self-check in, however, we were served by a staff member. When we asked for an Iron on Friday evening, as we entered the lift we met a member of staff on on his way to our room to give us the iron. Service was very good.

You could do worse than to stay there for a general trip to London, although as you are in Zone 3 you have to be prepared to spend more time and money on travelling. The pros of this hotel are the location, if you are interested in shopping and/or the Olympics. Additionally it is very close to Stratford tube and Stratford International is right opposite the hotel. Stratford tube is useful as the Central Line and Jubilee Line both run from it. More positives were finish of the room - everything was (quite rightly, considering it was brand new) immaculate. The bed, in particular, was really comfortable. The towels and bedding were also soft and very clean. The staff were absolutely lovely, without exception, and seemed to really care about whether you enjoyed your stay. Despite being over the bar our room was quiet and the sound-proofing was excellent. Even though it was 30 degrees when we stayed we found the air conditioning more than adequate - in fact we had to turn it down. The room was fairly sparsely furnished but the TV was good, and the carpet was spotless. The cons (and I admit I am nitpicking somewhat) are that the hotel is really badly signposted, and as it is located at the end of a REALLY busy shopping centre it might be hard to find. I was lucky as I had been before and I knew where I was headed. The door of my room stuck very badly and I had to put my full force into opening it every time. Breakfast on the Sunday was pretty chaotic, and the staff tried really hard, but struggled to keep up with demand. The restaurant was vast, and nicely decorated, but it accommodated more people than they could actually deal with. As a result the queue for hot food, toast etc. was pretty long and the veggie sausages I requested just never arrived.

A little hard to find by road, but the Stratford International Railway Station is right next door to the hotel, which makes for a departure to St.Pancras for the Eurostar to Paris, even easier. The local tube station Stratford is on the other side of the Westfield shopping centre and very well integrated into this busy hub. Westfield Stratford City is an amazing shopping precinct and the largest in Europe, so it was a real treat to see the opening of this new London icon too. Having the hotel next door to the centre is very appealing and suited our needs very well. The room was a little small, but the beds were comfortable. I was fortunate enough to get a room overlooking the new Olympic stadium, so ask for this if you can at the time of the booking. As you would expect all the facilities in the room were modern and well presented. One big mistake the owners have made though, was that there was no bar fridge or mini bar. It would have been nice to be able to place some items we had such as water & milk in a fridge. The breakfast is superb, and if you are travelling with children, make sure you pay for the premium breakfast which means that kids eat free. You can even request an omelette instead of the scrambled eggs on offer. The bar is well stocked but unfortunately this is where the hotel fails to deliver. Opening days are the most testing times for staff, but having dining room waitresses behind the bar serving is an obvious mistake that should not happen. Not knowing how to pull a beer is embarrassing for staff and worse for the customers. Patrons were forced to show staff how to pull a beer, so there was an obvious lack of staff training which I am sure will be rectified in the future.

The hotel is built right on top of the Westfield Stratford City shopping centre, and is next to the Olympic Park. So easy to get to thanks to the new infrastructure being put in place for the Games - you have a choice of tube lines into the newly upgraded Stratford underground, overground services to Stratford International, or DLR into the new Stratford International stop. Just note you need a Zone 1234 travelcard to get to Stratford. We had no teething troubles on our stay - room was spotless, beds comfortable, bathroom with shower gel/shampoo/soap - was very impressed to find air-conditioning. Worth asking before arrival if you could have a room on the higher floors with a view of the Olympic Stadium (I can't remember which side of the hotel looks out where...). There's a nice bar, and a restaurant serving well-priced food - we didn't eat in the evenings so can't comment on the quality, however downstairs in the Westfield centre there are all manner of restaurants, fast food takeaways, food courts etc to choose from.

It's \u00a37.99 for a buffet, with 2 kids per adult eating free. Good value. Nice safe area, lots of security around til late, and no need to wander the streets unless you chose to. Doesn't look like the sort of Premier Inn that's going to attract the stag/hen night crowd so potentially quiet at night... it was last weekend anyway! The hotel really is fantastically served by train/tube - you can get the Jubilee Line direct to the O2, Greenwich, Embankment/Westminster, Green Park for Buckingham Palace - Central Line takes you to Oxford Street etc. Our kids loved the driverless DLR which takes you to Tower Hill/Bank, or down through Canary Wharf to Greenwich. My recommendation for a different route to the centre would be get the DLR to the O2, then get the Thames Clipper river bus to Tower Pier or the London Eye pier.
