{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Worse hotel EVER!!! Not even a hotel, should call it a MOTEL!! We also booked this hotel through travel agent in Sydney and was told this is a good place to stay. But when I arrived at this hotel back in March 08, my kids and I was shocked, this can't be a 3 star hotel, I have checked through their website and there was not much information!! First of all, they showed us this room in level 7 that took about 6 steps from the lift and the room smelt [their explanation was because of the renovation then they should fix this problem before they open their business!!], the wall paper was dark, wet and stained, the room was also very small and the most worrisome problem is that there was another wooden door that was broken to the room next door! The toilet and shower door was broken too!! That is unbelievable! You could practically kick the door and it would open! After my complaint, they took me up to level 12 to another room, that room is a little bit better but still have the same problems. I ended up not even staying there and went to my family's place and went back there 3 days later to pick up my luggages and the worse thing was that all my clothes had absorbed the smell and I had to take all my clothes to dry clean!!! It was the worse experience that I even had. I definitely will not go there again or recommend anyone either.", "Date": "Dec 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR526335475", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "cathycc75"}, {"Content": "Dirty and stuffy hotel We booked a hotel through the travel agent and she assured us that this hotel is a very nice hotel with a very good location.

How wrong we were!We realised something was wrong when we walked through the door in reception mid Oct 2008 which was filled with suitcases across the floor and people everywhere. The room we were given in the Imperial hotel was 1712 located on the top floor. The small lift did work, but we were surprised when the doors opened to view a narrow hallway carpet covered in a dust sheet and a laundry trolley in the way. Our room was at the very end of a dimly lit corridor.On opening the door to the room the smell of damp hit home, along with the noise of an air-conditioning unit and a dehumidifier. The windows were locked shut so there was no way to vent this foul smell. To add to injury there was a hole in the wall.The room itself was fairly small though the bed was of reasonable size and the bathroom was compact with a bath, shower and WC which were clean but certainly not worth $1200 HKD ($154 USD or \u62e290 GBP) per night.We decided to go for a walk to discuss options before returning, collecting our bags and leaving the Imperial Hotel. Total time from check-in to check-out being approx two hours. In view of this we asked for our money back, but the manager refused point-blank to return any money because we had booked the hotel online. The fact the service received and quality of room were sub-standard seemed to have been missed.My recommendation to any visitors to Hong Kong. The Imperial Hotel in Hong Kong is one hotel that should be avoided at all costs - there are plenty other hotels in Hong Kong at a similar price range offering far better facilities.Though I was forced to sign 'under duress' the credit card slip before leaving the Imperial Hotel in Hong Kong, though I will now be contacting my credit card company to demand a full refund.Basil Fawlty would have been proud of the totally crap service provided by the Imperial Hotel  staff.

We could not be more embarassed when we arrived at the place. Upon entering the lobby and checking in, there was a bell boy loitering the area. He just looked at us with our suitcases, and did not even offer to assist us to our rooms. That's just the start.When we got to the 17th floor where our room was located, I was instantly dismayed to see that there were several rooms in the same floor which were under construction. There was no attempt to cover these up, as the rubble and construction mess was in plain view. Also, there was a garbage bag in the middle of the hallway. When we entered our room, we found that it was tiny. The bathroom was even tinier. One would have to be really skinny to use the toilet because there is not much space between the wall and the bathtub, where the toilet is located.The glasses provided in the bathroom were smudgy, as if they were not washed since the last occupant left.The bed cover was old and caused us to itch. When we removed the bed cover, the blanket was worn out and looked even more uncomfortable. Worst, when we removed the blanket, we found that the bedsheet had a stain which looked like blood.The towels were no better. Two out of three towels provided had stains. Bathroom amenities were terrible. The hotel was very stingy with shampoo, which was contained in sachets. This is the only hotel I've been to where the shampoo is provided in sachets. The toothpaste tasted like putty and did not produce foam. The bristles of the toothbrush came loose in my mouth as I was using it.Cleanliness is not a priority in Imperial Hotel. When the cleaning lady came to our room, she only changed the sheets (thank God!) and made up the bed, and nothing much else. She failed to clean a big mud spot in the middle of the bathroom which was impossible to miss.Forget about sleeping in, too, as you will be disturbed by staff who do not care much for peace and quiet. The cleaning lady knocked on our door asking if she could clean. When I replied Not yet, she came back two times more in a span of five minutes. On the day we were leaving, our 35 guests, plus luggage, were in the lobby waiting for the shuttle. The moment the shuttle came, the manager asked my husband if the group could leave already. My husband found this completely rude, and told the manager that if our group had to go, he would have to ask the other guests loitering in the lobby to leave too. It was only then that the manager backed off.We actually had arranged to stay for one more night at Imperial Hotel after our guests left. However, the never-ending horrors in this hotel led us to look for a room for our remaining night in another hotel. Guess what -- a room in Marco Polo Hong Kong Hotel cost only HKD100 more than booking an extra night in Imperial! Needless to say, we were out of there in a flash.After our stay in Imperial, Marco Polo Hong Kong hotel was heaven. But then again, it isn't difficult for most hotels to top the nightmare that is Imperial Hotel.", "Date": "Jun 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR339959962", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "HKTravelAddict"}, {"Content": "What a rip off!! My husband and I were coming in to Hong Kong for an exhibition. As we could not get a single room in any hotel, we finally ended up with the one room available at, The Imperial'.I read the reviews and thought, how could a 'three star' hotel be that bad. Well, after staying there for five days, all I can say is that the three star rating has to be only for the hotels location. Location: Excellent: You can walk down the entire stretch and do your shopping. There are seven elevens as well as the Sheraton on one side and the Holiday Inn on the other. The mrt station is just opposite the hotel. Brilliant location.Food: There is none! No room service or restaurant. No breakfast! You have to go out for anything to eat or drink. You can make packet tea or coffee but it is awful.Room: Smelly, damp and hardly any lights. I think they keep the room lights dim so you miss seeing the dirt and everything else. Bathroom: Tiny. But the shower was good. Hot water and basic toiletries.Reception: They hardly smile or speak english. They will write down things for you and help with directions. Overall, only stay here if you don't get a room some where else, or you are going to be out all day anyway.

I'd say that the lobby picture isn't that deceiving, if you can accept that what you see in the picture is all there is to the place, save for a tiny niche containing a circle of couches and a table. There is a toilet, but this is actually a shared toilet with the adjoining restaurant, and requires a walk through an incredibly shoddy and depressing hallway.The elevators up the hotel are inconveniently shaped and are cramped like none I have been in before and there are no staff to help you bring your luggage up (although in my experience there were almost no staff to help you do anything). The lift stopped at the 16th floor and when the doors opened my first thought was Basil Fawlty, the hallway was stark white with imitation foam as a ceiling, some of which was sagging for God's sake.Since I was travelling with a small group at peak season, we split in to pairs and had adjacent rooms at the rear corners of the hotel. Me and my partner opened the door with a sense of foreboding, and when it swung open I felt like I was going to laugh at how ridiculously bad the room was and break down crying about the fact I was staying in it.I walked over to my friends' room and it appeared to be even worse, there was a rough hole in the bedside table and the ceiling was cracked concrete. I walked to the curtains and threw them open to be met by two large panes of immovable, frosted glass. My disappointment increased when I ran back to my room to inspect the area behind the curtains to find one frosted pane, and one normal one giving my a stunning city-scape view: towers of dejectedly browning slum-like buildings.The rooms were ludicrously small (I'd guess 2.5m by 3m), barely fitting two beds, a desk, a poorly positioned closet, a mirror, a TV, a fluorescent light and two wall-mounted lamps. Those lights and lamps were the one of two sources of light and they failed at being those very things. That was accompanied by the fact that the only other source was sunlight from the windows, and that light requires you to view that horrid sight of deteriorating buildings. The beds were insanely uncomfortable, causing me to change positions every few minutes (even when I was sitting on it) and making me have a back ache in the morning.The room constantly stank of a dank stench similar to that of a basement, only the room also had carpet to absorb it. We bought a can of disinfectant spray to combat it, but it took three rounds of spraying to make it bearable. The TV had an average-to-poor amount of reception, and very limited channels, although it was edging on alright.The bathroom is a roughly 1.5m by 2.5m area with a small bath, a toilet and a basin with nothing to hide the grimy pipes below it. To be fair it stank a lot less than the actual room and I could bear to be in it for a fair length of time. That's it on the rooms, you can make the judgement on whether you like them or not, but I for one severely disliked them.I had a few normal run-ins with the staff, two with the reception (which was okay) and two with doormen/informative standing people. The first was alright, and he helped us make it to the ferry and to Hong Kong island, and the second helped us call a taxi to another ferry terminal that we would take to leave to another destination. The latter sped off with our luggage, forcing one of us to run to keep him in sight just in case he ran off for good, and he managed to get four of us and oh so many pieces of luggage jammed into the car. Although he could've done worse, this was less than desirable.The location of the hotel just gives you access to shops plastered with flashy neon signs, most saying 'Sony', and many people trying to force you into their shops to buy something, though the only reason you would would be so you could just go away and be left alone. The hotel gets points for being near the MTR station but when it comes to location that's all I can give it that's positive.All in all, stay away from the Imperial Hotel in Hong Kong unless it's the absolute last option you have to be able to stay in Hong Kong territory, and even then, you may consider just not going in order to avoid this atrocity, because if you befall the same fate I did, your opinion of Hong Kong will become very low, and the best time you'll have with the hotel is the time you check out.", "Date": "Jan 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR292647819", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "GreyFlame"}, {"Content": "Don't expect any frills       Bathroom", "Date": "Dec 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR490573458", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Traveler_travel"}, {"Content": "stay away!!! Greasy, sleazy, stay away! On rip-off street Nathan Road, amidst the Camera-stores with their well-earned reputation of no service - high price lays the 'Imperial hotel.

The whole hotel is so run-down in fact that it badly needs a renovation since at least 20 years.

I dreaded what to expect in the bedroom. However, our room was not as bad as the corridors. HOwever, there were parts of the room where the paint was peeling away and the bathroom was very basic...more like a 1 star.

This hotel could barely rate a two star experience in my opinion.When we checked in I already had a bad feeling. The lobby is a small crowded hallway leading up to the elevators, which were probably the smallest elevators I have ever been in. Stepping out from the elevators into the skinny hallway didn't raise my expectations either. The hallway walls were bare. We entered our room and we were greeted with more of the same.The room was barely furnished with two beds, a cabinet, TV, and a refrigerator (which didn't seem to work). I turned on the TV and found out that the remote didn't work. (dead batteries?) There was one window in the room and it was frosted so you couldn't see out. (I felt like I didn't want to see what was on the other side anyway)The air conditioning was on full blast and even after turning it off the room was freezing. (even in the morning) The room also smelled strongly of an antiseptic odor.The bathroom didn't have any power outlets. The bathtub was really skinny and practically a hazard while taking a shower. There were wires connecting all the metal fixtures in the bathroom, for safety purposes. (weird)I sat down on the bed and it was like sitting on a desk. I've felt more comfortable sleeping on the ground outdoors than in this bed. The pillows were pretty sad too.They had wireless internet for 120 HKD for 24 hours, which I tried and was able to use. They charged us 5 HKD for local calls too, which surprised my girlfriend.After one night, we had enough so the next day we packed up early and checked out. We had paid in advance through the travel agent so we asked the hotel to refund the second night. (we had reserved two) The staff gave us the runaround. At first my girlfriend discussed the issue with them in cantonese. The agent at the hotel (who turned out to be the assistant manager !) claimed that the hotel wasn't in possession of the payment and was under a contractual obligation to charge for two nights. (The travel agent denied this) He also stated that he didn't want to refund the money to the travel agent because there would be no guarantees that the travel agent would refund the money to you. My girlfriend continued to talk to him and the agent while I went to check us into another hotel. When I finally came back 30-40 minutes later they were still going back and forth. We left to take our luggage to the other hotel.When we returned to the hotel I spoke to the same agent (in english). I explained to him that if he billed us for the night we didn't stay that I would call the hong kong tourist hotline and file a complaint. He eventually capitulated.We later found out that the hotel was in fact already in possession of the payment. After the hotel refunded the money to travel agent the agent returned the money to us nearly immediately.I tried to come up with some good things about this place and about the best I could come up with were: no bugs that we saw, there was hot water, and it seemed clean.

We stayed for three nights. Our room was surely not as nice as the one that is displayed in the internet.

The TV reception was very poor, too.I agree with other reviewers about the unfriendly reception staff, although that's the thing you can cope with the easiest.Why I only rate it with one star is the cost performance ratio. It is far too expensive for what you get. I travelled through SE Asia and I'd say that for the same category you might pay 20USD (if ever) in Thailand, Malaysia or whatsoever. In Vietnam I had mere luxury for 15USD, but for the Imperial we paid 200 USD per night for a decent hole.

I stayed here a few years ago and I have to say that I certainly hope they have improved on ALOT of things about this hotel. First, the lobby is small and uninviting. The fixtures are old and need a good remodeling. This is the same for the rooms themselves. They are small and very bland. Don't expect any frills at this hotel. We were a group of 5 people but requested adjoining rooms. We had requested a roll away and because of the small size of the room, our only spot to put it was right in front of the adjoining room door. Generally I'm not too worried about leaving used cups or food around in a hotel room. I suggest that YOU be worried about leaving food out in this hotel. I had a soda and left the empty glass on the counter. The next morning there was a very large cockroach stuck in there. I was very tempted to bring this down to the front desk but I figured we were out of there that day.At check-out, I was charged for pay-tv that I didn't even watch. I had told them that but the management took out a book with all the times we supposedly had the television on with the pay-tv on.
