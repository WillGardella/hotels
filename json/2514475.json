It's an experience you need to take with an open mind. The visitor's area is clean, safe, affordable, and in a wonderful location. Other parts of the facility help the less fortunate. Don't leave valuables in your room, and don't get too upset if you need to buy your own toilet paper, or a light bulb. The TV was old, the gas stove didn't work, and yes, they turn the heat and hot water off at night, and back on around 5:00 in the morning. I've stayed for as long as a month at a time, and quickly became part of the eclectic group. This place serves a purpose. Be nice to the staff, especially the very large guard at the door.", "Date": "September 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cThe Allerton Hotel is a GREAT place to stay in NYC\u201d", "Author": "grc102", "ReviewID": "UR26534683", "Content": "We stayed at the Allerton on several occasions and hope to stay there again, I heard it will be reopening and hope that is true.

The biggest problem I found was that NY in Decenber is cold and the heating was turned off at night and it was extremely cold!!! The location is not too bad and there is a lovely cafe over and up 1 block. Not a place to stay if you like comfort but okay if your on a budget.Also security is on the main entrance but the locks on the bedroom doors are poor to say the least.", "Date": "January 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome", "Title": "\u201cSimple but pretty clean and cheap\u201d", "Author": "smartie_p", "ReviewID": "UR2241709", "Content": "Nothing special, but pretty clean and cheap.

It is in an excellent position, the rooms are clean if spartan and the staff are friendly - if you are! There are 3 sections, one of which is for visitors and yes the other sections house people in less fortunate circumstances. It is totally hassle free and if my tourist dollars help a few people back into a regular life, then that's great.

For Manhatten it provided an excellent base for getting around in a clean, safe and extremely good value setting. My sister has also stayed there twice and I had stayed there once before and think it is 'characterful', even the food van that parks outside and the visiting social worker. Yes, we could have paid more and stayed in the Holiday Inn, but there's plenty of those in London if we wanted a bland experience. The Big Cup cafe opposite and the lovely East of Eighth restaurant nearby are also great places.", "Date": "January 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cALLERTON a dump?\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1518696", "Content": "I visited on 5th to 10th December, 2003.
