When it was time to go out & see new York I didn't feel comfortable carrying my passport & money so kindly asked the front desk agent to put it in their safe.. Only to be told they DIDNT have one...now I was extremely worried but reluctantly left it behind anyways..then I asked how to catch the dbl decker sightseeing bus.. the front desk agent pointed across the room to a young lady sitting behind a little booth. I approached the young woman & bought 2 bus tickets. When I asked her where to catch the bus she seemed unable to answer me.. Then gave us completly misguided directions. Whereas it took us almost an hour to find the area to catch it.. Once back at the hotel AGAIN we asked the front desk agent where a good place to eat would be & he directed us to Bond 45 across the street.. Again bad choice.. It was like eating food that had been run over by a car..later when back at the hotel & in our room. I noticed the room faced an office building.. With no view & the carpet by the window, to me appeared to have been laid by an inexperienced layman it looked like someone butchered it with an exacto knife. I work in a very nice hotel in my home town & let me tell you it puts this hotel to shame & readers at $268.00 a night they didn't even offer a shuttle service or continental breakfast. I may sound picky but at this price you'd think they'd offer something!! Even when we were checking out the front desk agent seemed more concerned that we were only staying the one night & didn't even ask if we enjoyed our stay.. Something my hotel where I work always makes sure to ask!

The hotel is very similar to an older, two-star hotel in Europe. So, if you've traveled to Europe and were happy to stay in an older family-run hotel, the St. James will hold no surprises.

If we didn't want to hang out they did have lockers for $5 each which fits one suitcase per locker. Some people are complaining about having to turn in the key when you leave each day and picking it up when you are going back to the room but I preferred it because you knew that you didn't leave it in the room and you didn't have to worry about losing out. They have 2 cafe/deli places next door which were convenient. We were within walking distance of most of the stuff we wanted to do. For the other stuff we took a 2 day bus tour which was 2 blocks from the hotel. I would recommend bringing earplugs as the windows did not keep out the sounds and it is a busy street. They have a booth a the hotel that you can book stuff at, we booked our shuttle back to the airport and it worked out great.

Room was small but they all a in NYC, the wardrobe was the smallest thing I had ever seen, bed was tiny and a double ( we booked 2 singles) furniture was worn and tired with scratches all over it. There was blood marks on the wall and no air conditioning so we had to wedge open the window and put up with the sound of NYC at night which is loud and full of sirens. Radiator ( that was supported 1 side by wooden blocks) was blasting out heat and the pipes in the bathroom were rattling all night. Bathroom was small but clean but again roasting hot with exposed hot pipes, thankfully we never had out children with us so no one got burned! One night was enough even though we booked for 3, we immediately packed up quickly and left early the next morning. We informed reception that we were not impressed and it is nothing like the images online but they did not care as room had been paid in full as we booked through a travel agent, they took our key and that was that, no question of what was wrong etc.......

They told that there is internet acess free to all rooms, but I only was able to connect in lobby and the signal was horrible.

I am used to staying at larger, more upscale hotels so I was a little concerned when we got onto the tiny elevator and up to the narrow hallways. Definitely not what I am used to - it seemed more like a NYC walk up. We had an actual KEY to open our room door and we were told we would need to leave it at the front desk when coming and going - that was a first! And again, left me a bit unnerved because not what I'm used to. The room had very old architecture, same as the building. Windows with wood moldings and frames and they ACTUALLY OPEN!!! BUT, the hotel lobby was inviting, the staff pleasant, and the Room was CLEAN and smelled fine, actually, there was no smell at all. The bedding was a little old - but clean, and I checked all the way down to the mattress. The room was very cool and there was a bit of a draft coming in through the AC in the window but by the time we went to bed it was very comfortable. The room had everything we needed but nothing more which was fine because all we did was sleep and we did sleep! (It was a little noisy at times, but New York is noisy and it is NOT a huge hotel chain with sound proof windows etc.) They offer a flat screen tv and free wifi and there is computer access in the lobby. One of the best features were the lockers they offer in the lobby. We checked in on Saturday late afternoon, went to Madame Toussads(got discounted tickets from the conceirge and was able to skip the very long line with VIP pass), then came back to bed. Next morning we went for breakfast then checked out, BUT we still had plans for Sunday - the Museum of Natural History in the morning and Mary Poppins at 3. We took a locker and loaded our gear and were able to spend all of Sunday and part of Sunday night in the city without lugging around our gear. We all had a great time and felt very comfortable.

COMPLETELY booked this hotel b/c of the Trip Adv Reviews!!! Was SO excited and very much looking forward to a special evening with my younger daughter. Unfortunately, a big mistake! Reserved for 1 night as we were mtg up with a high school group the next day. Stayed here solely b/c of LOCATION and so that my daughter & I could take in a little sight seeing and get a good night's sleep before mtg up with our group. Let's just say after checking in at 6pm, we occupied 3 different rooms by 2:00 a.m. The 1st smelled as though someone spilled a CASE of cologne, the 2nd b/c still at 1:00 a.m. it must have been 85+ degrees in the room. Getting settled in the 2nd room around 10:30, we went to bed with cold wash clothes on us to cool down thinking the 1 open window would eventually cool the room, nevermind the NYC noise IF you keep the window open. Completely unaware of good cust service, mgmt acted as though we were imposing when explaining not being able to sleep in a room that would give anyone a migraine b/c of the smell (originally told they were sold out). When trying to use the room phone to call the front desk at 1 a.m. to inquire about A/C, realized there were no markings on the phone to do so. Looked up the ph # on my printed confirm# and used my Cell to call the front desk. Mgmt stood in my room while my daughter & I were in our PJ's and told us that we should keep open the window (open since moving there at 10:30) and sleep with our sheets off. Yes, for $200/night, I did not know I would be told how to sleep. The whole experience frustrating and how humiliating to stand there in front of that man (in front of my daughter) and listen to his jibberish! Not at anytime did a staff member EVER offer to help move our luggage, bring another key to our room, apologize for any inconvenience, etc.. It was my daughter & I up & down the elevator getting a key to a different room, they behaving as if they could care less whether we stayed or left. Only the next morning when realizing we could not exit our room as the door knob would not turn and we could not get out, did I decide that I would post on Trip Adv (never done this). Brought to tears and sick to my stomach realizing the Hotel St James is a HUGE SAFETY hazard! There are too many other ridiculous details to share, but I couldn't live with myself had I not posted. A hotel SPECTACULAR for LOCATION but nothing else!! Mgmt hasn't a clue! Rooms were much of what I expected. Looking for no frills, only wanting a clean bed/safe spot as we were just staying the night. But really....no way to cool or warm a room? No alarm clock or phone to reach the front desk, and lastly but most importantly, actual metal keys to rooms in which doorknobs need changed. A fire in this bldg would most certainly be an absolute Disaster as no one could even attempt to help or fend for themselves (esp on 11th flr) Certainly hope the mgr at the front desk took my request to heart when she asked \"housekeeping\" to check into what I was speaking of. If not, I've taken appropriate action. Please know if you read this, I am a very fair person, but I would not allow my beloved dog stay here.

One day we went out and came back and our room was not even cleaned up. Also, no hair dryer, only two small soaps and one shampoo was all they put, the water was not hot enough, and the shower looked more like a hand faucet for a kitchen , it was not even a big shower head, more water came out of the basin then from the shower, plus there was so much noise from the street, is like it doesnt have means of isolating the noise, they dont have iron either, the tv was super low, at the bed level , so we could barely see the tv, since it was so low, to top it off, the bed was super uncomfortable, it was like sleeping on a rock, they only had two pillows , super small too and uncomfortable, no extra pillows, nothing.

I enjoyed my stay here and even on a budget, i think this hotel does exactly what it says on the tin! i would stay here again if i was on a budget, and besides you are in New York, thehotel is the last place you are supposed to be! you have to pay for internet (which disappointed me a little), but the staff were great about storing our bags themselves instead of using lockers when we had to check out and wait til much later for our flight, the concierge was very well informed too. all in all not a bad stay.

After doing a lot of internet searching, we ended up at the Hotel St James. Having read a number of very negative reviews, we were fairly concerned.. which was absolutely unnecessary! As long as you don't have extremely high standards, this is the hotel for you! What do we mean by extremely high standards? Well, the elevator is a little slow, the hallways are just plain ugly, and the rooms don't have a giant plasma tv but just a good old crt instead; if that does not bother you, you're good! (how much time are you going to spend hanging around in the hallway anyway!?) Continuing with the important things, we found the room to be more spacious than we expected based on the reviews. Every day, housekeeping cleaned our room and supplied us with fresh towels and such. There was no sign of bedbugs whatsoever. The best part of this hotel is definately its staff. Everyone at the frontdesk is very friendly. In particular, we want to thank Mark for all his help; we couldn't have wished for a better service! As you can read in all the other reviews, the deli next door serves a great breakfast. If this is your first visit to New York, make sure to get tickets for the hop-on, hop-off sightseeing tours. Also, make sure to get tickets for the red buses instead of the blue ones, since the red offer more tours for less money. Finally, there is a free transfer ferry called the Staten Island Ferry, which will give you a great view of Manhattan as well as get you close to the Statue of Liberty.

The St. James has an odd system. They dispense one physical key to the room and you have to hand it back in to the front desk every time you leave the place. They re-issue it when you return. On the day we were to check out, we left at 9:00 in the morning to go shopping and handed in our key. The desk clerk never reminded us that checkout was noon. I had forgotten this detail, and we returned at 3:20. The desk clerk chastised us for coming back late and said we'd have to pay another night. I asked why he had not reminded us when we left in the morning. He sassed back, \"because you didn't ask.\" Our things were in the room and he would not give us the key to go gather our stuff until I gave him my credit card. After some arguing, the blond woman boss-type told the desk guy that he could charge me $100 instead of the full night. He added all kinds of taxes to that - occupancy tax when we were not even occupying - and came out with $118. The only good things about the place are its location and the fact that it does not have bed bugs. The room was dark to the point that we could not see to write postcards, the bathroom ran out of toilet paper and there was no spare roll, the bathroom has no shelf or countertop to put things like contact lens supplies and such (we had to use the windowsill), the two elevators are so small and slow that we walked up the three flights to be faster every time we came and went, and with the exception of one nice guy at the front desk, the rest were abrupt. All in all I'd never stay here again. Oh, I forgot to say that when we did get the key and go to our room on that check out day, an Asian maid was in there finishing up her housekeeping duties and she was angry with us. She grouched something to the effect that we made her work late. I said I'd use the bathroom and leave immediately. She said, \"no, no. all clean for next guest. no can use.\" Well, I respected her wishes and did not use it, deferring instead to the one off the lobby as we left.

We searched the internet for days trying to find a central, affordable basecamp for exploring New York. Not only did Hotel St James deliver on this level but many others as well as I'll explain... I travelled with my Dad (who has already left his own review) who is 60 and whose back has seen better days and my boyfriend who is 21 and not easily impressed! =) Getting there: We took a cab straight from JFK and were amazed at the efficiency of the rank. It's probably the least stressful way to get into Manhatten as long as you can handle the driving! This costs $45 (flatrate) plus about $5 for tolls plus tip. Arriving at the hotel: Even from outside the hotel looked spotless. We were greeted at the desk by Jay, smiling and very friendly. We signed some documents and took one of two lifts to our room on the second floor (212). The room was very spacious with two double beds, a large closet, long dresser with TV and coffee table with two chairs. The bathroom is very small but extremely clean and hey.. what do you want from a bathroom?! Both the sheets on the bed and the towels in the bathroom were clean and we had fresh towels every day, though we did leave about $3 a day tip. One tip: if you're sleeping in the bed by the window during the winter months, ask for another blanket or two as the wind does come through the window a bit. But the beds are very comfortable as even my dad (with the bad back) can account for! One other thing to keep in mind is that there is a bit of noise in the back of the hotel in the mornings from the diners next door but my boyfriend slept right through and I just put my earplugs in. Venturing out: We were out of the hotel at 8ish every morning so having two diners right next door was beyond helpful! Both have the most amazing variety of food for you to try, both are very reasonably priced and both are a great way to start your days. Turn right out of the hotel and you are about 30 seconds from Times Square!!! Rockefeller Centre was about 5 mins away, as was fifth avenue and Empire State Building was about 10 mins walk away. We took the subway to Battery Park to go to the Statue of Liberty and you can get a day travel card for $8.25 for the subway which is really handy if you want to get around a lot in a short amount of time. Other information: There are two Irish pubs on the same street as the hotel, we only went to O'Lunneys but can fully recommend the beer and the food (especially the super super tender beef brisket). There are about 4 computers with internet in the hotel which are pay as you go. They are also linked up to printers which were very helpful to us for checking in online for the flights. Check out is at 11am but there is a room in reception which have lockers that you can rent for 24 for $5. The lockers are electronic and are huge!!! We fitted in two suitcases, a large holdall, a large piece of handluggage and a rucksack! All three of us were thrilled with our stay at Hotel St James but if you are expecting luxury you will be disappointed. If you take it for what it is, a clean, affordable hotel in central Manhatten, then you will have a super holiday!

The patrons gave it good reviews about location and reasonable rates so we went with it. We too were very pleased! Although, I can totally understand that if you expect to be pampered with extra ammenities, this is not the place for you. The elevator is very small. The rooms are adequate with a private bath. The staff was cordial. I got a little nervous when we observed a lady checking out of her room and arguing with the desk clerk about how her rate had changed during her stay. Ours, however, was prepaid though an on-line travel agency and we had no problem. Our rate was exceptional for being one block from Times Square! Outside of the hotel's front door are two 24-hour delis that had great breakfast foods, salads, sandwiches and snacks. All of the broadway shows are a short walk away.

I could spend hours bigging this hotel up but I will avoid doing so because my last paragraph will sum it up for you. 2 doors away is a deli - WOW!! pleassse go to the Cranberry we were up and out of bed for 6.30am each morning, Whilst my wife phoned her family I went down to get a couple of coffees and a juice, Britain could learn a lot from this place coz if is better than any cafe we have ever been to EVER! I am at the point of becoming too impartial with my praise of this hotel so let me hit you with the facts - Totally patient staff, help with whatever you want....I needed to use phone at reception AFTER checkout to see where our airport transfer was--no charge! I left my mobile phone in room and they arranged transportation back to UK..It cost me a few Dollars but they were fantastic with the service and honesty.

No hair dryer or iron: Both available at the front desk upon request. Elevators tiny and slow: Smaller and a little slower than usual, but did the job just fine. Rude staff: The staff were friendly and always had a smile on their face. No ice machine, no fridge or microwave: You can buy cups of ice from the deli next door for 50cents.

The noise: With the noise, comes the city & really that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you're there for. Rooms being small: smaller than normal, but nothing as bad as what I had expected!

This did not bother us because it was better than us having to carry it around or losing it. Coming back in to pick up your key, you say your room number and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. They don't ask for a name or any ID. This would be my only complaint. Word of advice: Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t catch the hotel shuttle bus. A cab to JFK is $45. Shuttle bus is $43 (not including tips) St. James is the first pick up point, leaving an hour afterwards of picking up from at least 7 hotels around Times Square. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND ST.

Turn Right at the main door and after a 1 minute walk you're slap bang in the middle of Times Square! The deli right next door to the hotel was lovely, was great having breakfast with the New York buisness men and police men every morning, was a very authentic experience. The concierge was very helpful with booking theatre tickets, the hotel can also arrange for a minibus to collect you and take you to the airport for your flight home.

The rooms are a decent size (we travel around Europe regularly and just got back from Japan, so we thought they were a pretty normal size. Americans may find the rooms small I suppose.) Most of the staff at the desk were very friendly.... the only exception was when I had to pay to use the internet in the lobby, and the printer didn't work. The guy working at the desk told me that the particular computer I was using wasn't connected to the printer. Since I had just paid 50 cents to print, I complained that there was no sign or warning ahead of time.... the response from the guy behind the desk was \"Well what do you want me to do about it?!?\". Not exactly what I expected to hear. So don't use the computer off to the side to print - it's not connected to the printer, and won't warn you, and will charge you money anyway. But the rest of the staff were great - I gave one of them our unused Radio City tour tickets because he was really nice and helpful.

The foyer was nice and new, with internet and concierge facilities, however the rooms were outdated and basic. We found a mouse or two in our room during the night, and had to do a mad clean, disposing of all rubbish which had not been emptied. My partner advised the front desk, who simply said \"sorry about that\", but didnt offer to change rooms or help out. Also, we had to hand in our 1 room key each time we left the building, and ask for it when we returned, which was extremely annoying. We were never asked for ID and were given someone else's key a number of times, which was extremely bad security. The concierge and one of the night receptionsists were very pushy with trying to sell tours etc, which was obvious they were getting commissions from. Even after these problems, I would still recommend the hotel if nothing else is available in the price range. SAVING MONEY If you have not booked in to see any shows or musicals, I would recommend a visit to the TKTS booth in Times Square on the day you wish to see a show, for heavily discounted tickets. You will also find lots of street vendors selling bus tours for the hop on hop off tours, which are great value.

The maids came in every day and changed the beds and cleaned the bathroom leaving fresh towels every day!!

The view - well there was no view in our room as we were at the back of the hotel - therefore looked onto the back of a building but hey we were not there to hang about the hotel for long so this wasnt a probelm for us. We had our laptop with us and we got connected to the St James netwrok without a problem and the connection speed was excellent. You had to hand your key into reception every time you went out - as soon as they recognised you you were able to get your key no problem, otherwise if someone was on the desk that you hadnt met before they would always ask your name before giving the key. The staff were friendly, we had no problem whatsoever at this hotel and would definately recommend it to others, wouldnt hesitate about staying here again. Lovely deli next door and if you have to be out your room before you head to airport you can hire lockers in the hotel, excellent idea and you know your luggage is safe!!

We were never told on check in to hand it in - so one night we were SHOUTED at by the guy at Reception for not handing it in - very embarrassing when there were a lot of people in the lobby.

Also our room was at the back which meant it was nice and quiet but we had absolutely no natural light at all so even in the middle of the day we had the light on - giving it a cell like quality! For those who really are on a budget then don't be put off, but if you can possibly manage to scrape together enough money to stay somewhere better then do - this hotel did ruin our stay in New York because we never felt safe there and i was always worried someone would have taken all our belongings when we got back.

The location of the hotel was excellent as I'am sure everyone who has stayed at the St James will confirm. The 2 deli's right next door came in handy when buying our fresh milk for our cups of tea. We chose this hotel because at the time, I counted more good reviews than bad ones, so I think that sums it up. If you require a hotel with immaculate cleaned rooms, safe deposit box's, irons, hairdryers etc then pay the 4 - 5 star hotel prices (there's plenty of them) The St James's is more than adequate for what you pay for.

We were there two nights before our cruise and four nights after our cruise. Upon arriving I told the gentleman at the front desk that I wanted a nice room, as I would be reviewing on Trip Advisor, and wanted to give a good report. We had room #411 the first two nights,and although a bit small, it was VERY clean. I did my bed bug search since there was a recent post about them here, and glad to report,no problems.This room looked to have had some recent improvements. The bathroom was sparkling clean. We found the front desk crew to be very pleasant. Upon check out (July 26th), we told the lady we would be back after our cruise, and we hoped to have the same room, or one equally as nice. So, she made notes in her computer. We got back to the St James on Thursday, July 31st, and since we were early (check in is at 3pm), we had to wait a little while before our room was ready. The man on the front desk let us put our luggage in a room off the bar, so we did not have to use the rental lockers the hotel now provides. They have a very nice new room (I guess it will be the bar/lounge area once renovations are done) with comfy leather chairs and tables, and so we sat down and watched a little tv while waiting. Soon after the noon check out, our room was ready. They told us we could wait for room #411, or we could take another room that they thought we would like, so we went up to check it out, and it was a really BIG room (612). Very clean just like the first room, so we checked in and got settled. I think the air conditioner worked better in #411, but it was just fine for us. Our only complaint, and it was minor, was the fact that someone had put a wrong remote control in our room, and it did not work with our tv, and they could never seem to find the right one, nor did they ever get anyone to reprogram it to work with our tv. This was a little annoying since we were there for 4 nights, but not so much that we wanted to go down stairs and say, \"Please get me a working remote\" ! On both stays, the elevator was working just fine for us. The second elevator ( they use this as a service elevator), was a little smalller and warmer, so we always took the main elevator. Since we didnt have to go up that many floors, we didnt have that much trouble. Sometimes my hubby did take the stairs, but that was just his choice. I didnt mind leaving the key at the front desk, but it annoyed hubby. Sometimes he left it, and sometimes he didnt. Usually, if I was in the room, he would take it, but not leave it. If we left the hotel together, he left it grudingly. Once or twice, they asked us our name, when it was someone different on the desk. I did ask about this practice, and the man I asked, said he always asked for a name unless he knew us by sight. We were very happy with our stay, and for the money we spent, would do so again!

We chose to stay there based on reviews from here and are both easy travellers and weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting much. However, we were expecting to have a clean room that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t infested by bed bugs!! After the first night I had a couple of red itchy bites which I assumed were from a mosquito. However by the end of the day I was covered literally from head to toe with lines of red lumps. I started searching through the sheets and mattress and discovered blood spots and shells, legs, etc from the bugs in the sheets!!! I then ripped the sheets off and looked along the edge of the mattress (where it sits into the bed frame) and saw HEAPS of them running in there!!! (FYI bed bugs are about the size of an apple seed and suck your blood in the early hours of the morning) Truly disgusting! Shocked we went downstairs and spoke to the front desk who moved us rooms and said they would see what they could do and speak to the owners. By this stage I was covered in over 130 red bites which had swelled up and become blister like, these then begin weeping and I had to dab them with a tissue throughout the day. It was awful! I had bites over my hands, all down my arms and back, down my legs and on my feet. They were extremely itchy and later become painful (my little finger swelled up twice its size!) I needed to see a pharmacist who prescribed a strong cream and oral tablets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which made me drowsy and unable to drink alcohol. I also had to wear long trousers and tops in 90F heat as the bites looked disgusting and it was quite embarrassing. It took 2 weeks for the itchiness, pain and swelling to go away. When we finally got to speak to the owners we were made wait for 30mins and then he basically started yelling at us and was so so rude. He said it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t his problem but he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153felt sorry for us\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd !!! He said it was our choice to stay there and also wait to speak to him and we could have just left.. it was shocking I could not believe the way we were treated. When I asked what he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d done to fix the problem he said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153how would I know\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hmmm which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m taking as nothing. We have stayed in hotels and hostels in over 30 countries throughout the world and this is the absolute worst we have ever been treated or experience we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had. Seriously STAY AWAY. I also received some new bites in the new room too so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing they were in there also. So here I am 3 weeks later and although the pain and itchiness is gone I still have red/purple scarring where the bites were.. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hoping that this will fade however I guess it will be months before it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back to normal again. On top of all this, the rooms where hot, it took 15 mins to get hot water each morning and cleaning staff and management were fighting and yelling at the front desk.. it was an awful environment. So word of warning DON\u00e2\u20ac\u2122T stay here. Stay somewhere else seriously don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risk your holiday here.

You are one block off of Times Square and have easy access to the entire city. Ten minutes of walking landed us at Central Park and ten more at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. However, the hotel's interior speaks of pre-Guliani Times Square. In other words, if you have ever seen those hotels pictured on Law and Order, where something shady went down - you have seen the Hotel St. James. The doors to the rooms were aluminum (rather than wooden), the carpet is old and worn, the walls are deeply gouged in places. There is no sound proofing between the rooms. I could hear every word spoken in the adjoining room and on a more disturbing level, every time the other room's occupants went to the rest room I heard that in vivid detail as well. Only one small elevator works; but it looks to have been recently updated. The hotel makes you remit your room key every time you leave the building; I was not comfortable with that. The night employee was less than professional and asked me to go next door and get him a cup of coffee; in the alternative he asked me to watch the front desk while he went next door. So there I was watching all the room keys people had given them while they went out . . . . not the image of security I usually choose. (but hey for $200, off Times Square, beggars can't be choosers) Also, they attempted to charge me for dialing '0' and being transferred to the 'concierge.' (they eventually took it off the bill) Don't expect free bag check, you must rent lockers in the back of the hotel if your flight gets in early or you are leaving late. Internet access is $2 for 10 minutes. If you are going to JFK don't take the shuttle, it leaves at inconvenient times and costs $5 less than just hiring a taxi (Taxis can only charge the standard $45 flat fee from Manhattan to JFK, plus a toll I think of about $5).

What if a child or some one with a pace maker used it and got an electric shock, it could prove fatal. So we wanted to know they were going to get it investigated and sorted. We spoke to the owner whose initial repsonse was they would send the maid to test it. When we pushed how dangerous it was and that they were risking people's lives she offered us a free night next time we came. One of the receptionists agreed with us that it needed investigating properly but the owner refused to accept the risk. It was only as we were leaving she said she'd send a general maintenance man to check it out, not a professional electrician. Since returning to the UK my friend has reported the matter to the New York council for them to investigate. On another note the elevators were a fiasco. When we were checking out it took 45 minutes to get back to the ground floor. We eventuay discovered one of the elevators was out of order and the other wasn't exactly working properly.

When we arrived we were all thrilled with our room (#402). It was very large and very clean. We had plenty of room for all of our luggage and the bathroom was well stocked with towels. There was never a problem with the shower, as we had plenty of hot water each day. The hotel staff was polite and helpful. We got a peek at the rooms across from ours and they both looked very nice with plenty of room. The Dunhill and Cranberry Deli right next door are great and inexpensive. The location was awesome. Only 1/2 a block to Times Square and a couple of blocks to Rockfeller Plaza and the subway station. Our room faced the street and that was a problem for us the first night. It was very noisey! But, we bought earplugs the next day and for the next 3 nights slept great! My daughter had to leave about 5 hours before the rest of our group and there was a shuttle that came to the hotel which she took for $19.00 with no problems. Our cab ride to and from LaGuardia was $34.00 plus tip. I would definitely stay at the St. James Hotel again. For the price and location you couldn't have asked for anything better.

We were a little anxious that we would be able to get one of the secure lockers, that are now used (cost $5) to store luggage after check out, but that didn't prove to be a problem. It was the availiabilty that concerned us not the cost, and when we voiced these concerns to the reception staff we were told that if no lockers were available we would be able to keep our room for an additional 2 hours at no extra cost - this would have taken us to 2pm and we were getting picked up at 3pm so would have been perfect for us had we required it. Apart from that it's the location and price of the St. James that are it's selling points, yes the decoration is a little outdated, the towels are small and the air con is noisy, but it is also very clean and there's always plenty of hot water (although sometimes it takes a while to get through the pipes.) We were a litte disappointed with our room, compared to our last stay, it was much smaller and darker (you don't stay in St. James for the views) and I'm sure the bed was smaller than an average queen, but it was no problem really and if we stay again I will ask about the room size on check in. It was this room that initially made me reluctant to score the hotel 4/5 but on thinking about it I should have asked to be moved as I'm pretty sure the hotel wasn't full and they would have obliged. Sometimes we just need to speak up! On arrival I noticed that one of the towels had make up marks on it, I took this down to reception and within 5 minutes all our towels had been replaced with a profuse apology. Personally we have always found all the St. James staff friendly and helpful and for the cost you really can't go wrong as long as you go expecting budget accomodation with no frills.", "Date": "June 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cSt James Times Square\u201d", "Author": "cocopopz", "ReviewID": "UR16566186", "Content": "We were not disappointed by our choice of hotel, which was greatly helped by reading the reviews here. Our room was large, tastefully furnished and spotlessly clean. Front desk was helpful and efficient, the crazy lifts provided entertainment and I would probably stay there again. We had noisy neighbours who interrupted my beauty sleep on two occasion, but a quick visit to Duane Reade and the purchase of heavy duty earplugs and some Tylenol PM sorted out that little problem. Our shower was pretty pathetic, but nothing could really spoil our trip. A friend of ours also had a room there for a few days and her shower worked perfectly, so we just drew a short straw on showers. Try out the Dunhill and Cranberry delis next door to the hotel. Dunhill does super breakfast, and Cranberry does a mean piece of pizza when you have the late night munchies. Don't attempt to shop on 5th ave unless you are loaded - Century 21 and Macy's to name but two are a better choice. Don't miss the cute little Jefferson Market Garden which is in Greenwich Village. It is maintained and run by volunteers and is just gorgeous. Hard to believe you're in a city sitting in it admiring the plants and birds. Also worth a visit is beautiful, leafy Bryant Park. You can do Tai Chi and play petanque there if you are so inclined. If you have a sweet tooth or secretly believe you are five years old inside, visit the M&Ms store in Times Square. Also don't miss the ferris wheel nearby in Toys R Us. OK, I will shut up now.

That being said, it was just what we needed for our stay in the city! Central location to everything! Within walking distance to anything! We arrived at the hotel 2 hours before check-in and the staff were more than happy to give us the first available room. We used the working elevator to get to our room. It worked just fine. We had walked from Penn Station to the hotel so we freshened up after unpacking. Hangers were available in the closet to hang anything up. The bed was even comfortable for the very, very little time that we did sleep. We didn't have a 'view' of anything but a wall, but we didn't care either since the only time we spent in our room was for showering and sleeping. One thing you will need to pack is an alarm. I just used my cell phone for the time/alarm. There were plenty of outlets for charging our phones and using our hairdryer and hairstraightners. There was a TV in the room, but I couldn't tell you anything about it because we did not use it. The A/C worked perfectly in our room. It stayed very cool. All we wanted was a place to rest our head at night, which we did very little of, and a nice hot shower, which it was - excellent! We were givin fresh towels daily and even asked for extra at the front desk with no problems. There was someone available at the front desk 24 hours. Our room had a deadbolt that worked perfectly. We felt extreamly safe. The one and only thing I did not like about the hotel was their request that you leave your room key with the front desk each time you left the hotel. Why? I'm not sure. I only did it once because when asking for it back the desk clerk did not ask for any type of I.D. - therefore anyone from off the street could have requested my room key and accessed my room at any time while I was away. SO, I just kept it in my pocket. Other than that everything was perfect! I'd absolutly stay there again.

Patrons of this hotel seemed to be predominantly foreign tourists.", "Date": "April 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cGood location, but its share of problems\u201d", "Author": "tarebearky", "ReviewID": "UR14662039", "Content": "I recently stayed for 5 nights at the St. James with a friend on our trip to NYC. We were in New York for a conference, and we booked the hotel because it was less expensive. We were very pleased with the location - less than a block to Times Square, just a few blocks to Rockefeller Center, close to PLENTY of restaurants and shopping. The location was perfect for exploring the city and for attending our conference. Aside from the location, we found the hotel to have a number of problems. First, the hotel is old and really rundown. The carpet in the hallway is really worn, with several holes. The walls in our room had several dents and marks. There were just a lot of cosmetic issues that made the hotel look less desirable. The lobby, on the other hand, actually looked really nice. It was just the upper floors (where the guest rooms were) that looked run down. Despite all of these features of the hotel showing that it's old and rundown, I actually felt like the hotel was pretty clean, which was more important to me. The bathroom and bedroom both felt clean to me, so I was comfortable staying here for the week. A bigger issue to me was the noise in the rooms. I had read in other reviews that the noise in the rooms was pretty loud, but I am usually not bothered by noise, so I thought it would be ok. I was wrong. We had a room that looked out on the street, and it was SOOOO loud. At night, we could hear everything happening on the street below. But that wasn't the worst part. Every morning of our stay, at 6:45 am, garbage trucks came down the street and proceeded to empty garbage cans for at least 20 minutes. It was so loud - it woke us up and we couldn't go back to sleep until they were finished. My friend and I joked that this was why the hotel room didn't have an alarm clock - there was a built-in alarm clock in the garbage trucks that came every morning. If you are staying at this hotel, I would definitely recommend that you request a room that does not face the street. The noise was really unbearable. Another big issue to us was the room key. Like others have said, each room has only one key and you have to leave your key at the front desk every time you leave. This part didn't bother us too much - since we had two people coming back to the room at different times, we were ok with leaving our key so that each of us could get into the room whenever we wanted. Our problem with this was that when we returned and asked for our key, we were NEVER asked for identification. This made us really uncomfortable. My friend said something to one of the workers about this, and he said that he remembered us. However, this was impossible, since it was a different worker almost every time we returned to the hotel. One time, they misunderstood us when we said our room number and they gave us the wrong key. Again, this made us really uncomfortable. The rooms really lacked security in our opinions for this reason. I'd be really careful about what you leave in your room. For the most part, we didn't have any trouble with water temperature, until the last morning. That morning, we couldn't get hot water, even after letting the water run for quite a while, so we had to take cold showers. The towels were really small and thin, but I think that's really a minor complaint. Also, one of the elevators is still out of order. The other elevator was usually pretty easy to get going up - the exception was when big groups were checking in and had luggage to take up. There was quite a line for the elevator, because the elevator is so small and can only fit a couple of people with their luggage. Getting an elevator to come down was a bigger problem - we gave up after the first day and we always walked down. I'm not sure I'd stay here again, especially after finding out that some of our colleagues were staying at much nicer hotels and only paying about $30-$40 more per night. This hotel is definitely a budget hotel, so just keep in mind that it has its share of problems. It's definitely do-able, but I'd recommend looking a little further before deciding on this hotel.", "Date": "March 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Asturias", "Title": "\u201cDisgusting\u201d", "Author": "alvarezgranda", "ReviewID": "UR14446882", "Content": "This place can not be called a hotel because it is a dump.

We had tons of storage space, and the bathroom was in very good condition. Our purpose of our stay was for sightseeing, and just as everyone says on here, we aren't looking for the Ritz, just a room to sleep in. We discovered that the heating system is crap, and made sooo much noise (sounded like a drummer in the radiator and he made noise every 45 mins or so) that my boyfriend ended up turning it off completely. You might think we are mad, as it'd be cold?? Luckily we were at the back of the hotel and were by the fire exit, so this seemed to help, and with both of us in there it didn't actually seem cold. My boyfriend managed to lock the window for extra security and as there is only a blind for privacy, we had this down the whole time there. Yes, the lift is ridiculously slow getting down to the floor where you are at, plus it always stops at 2nd floor. Just as we were leaving they were fixing the 2nd lift. We did walk down a few times (from 6th floor), however only walked up once, as after a day of walking around and feeling tired, the last thing you need is to walk up those stairs....almost finished me off. Staff were many....always a different face, but helpful when needing help. First lady I encountered could have been more lively (blond, skinny foreign lady), seemed more suited to a mortuary. But again, not looking for Ritz, although went past it! Toilet and shower were fab, no geysers or dodgy temperatures in our bathroom, were we one of the lucky people??? By previous reviews I think we were. It is a shame that no food or breakfast is given, as would be a good thing, even if tea/coffee was supplied, would be great. But that wasn't a problem, had a great Irish pub 30 secs away, McDonalds on every street/avenue, cafes and delis galore, and next to hotel was a fabulous deli serving fantastic rolls/subs/sandwiches, so I recommend them. And BEST bit, literally 40 secs walk to Times Sqaure, sooooo fabulous!!! Its great, if you like shopping...Virgin open until 2am, have Toys R Us open till very late....fantastic.

When we arrived we asked for a room on a low floor after reading the reviews on this site about the lifts being very slow. We got room 208 which is on the second floor directly facing the lifts and stairs so that was fine. With it being on a low floor there was noise of people going up and down the stairs but not overly noisy. Anyways when we went into the room first it was cold so went down to reception to ask them to switch on the radiator as it was behind a panel under window which needed to be screwed off in order to switch it on. They obliged and done it, went to bed that night and woke up the next morning and it was still not working, room was freezing. Said it to them at reception and they said no problem later on when you return from you day out we will move you to another room. One other thing about that room, is that in the bathroom there is a pipe which runs down the wall which is not enclosed so when others where having showers on upper floors you could hear the noise of water rushing down the pipe a bit annoying to say the least. So we were moved to the 8th floor, pretty much the same floor but with out the the noises, radiator worked fine. One other thing about this hotel is that none of the windows lock. Well seemed that way both of the rooms i stayed in you could not lock the windows and in the other room a friend of mine stayed in he could not lock his either. Overall i would have to recommend thou.

The lobby was much more spacious and inviting than what I'd expected after viewing the pics on the hotel web site, and there's a small sitting/library area adjacent. The staff are friendly and helpful, and we were able to check in at 11:00. Our room was enormous by New York City standards, and though there were no frills, it was spotlessly clean. And, importantly, the mattresses were excellent, with good pillows and very fresh linens. Sure, the walls could stand a new coat of paint, and the carpet was threadbare in spots, but with this sort of convenience, cleanliness, and economical rates, who would have the nerve to nitpick?

We arrived at 9am and our rooms were not ready, but we were able to leave our luggage in a locked room until our rooms were available. We did this and immediately left for the GrayLine bus tour of NYC. A must for anyone and was great to do on our first day there. The hotel is in a fantastic location. Out the door and to the right brings you to Times Square. Out the door and to the left 1 block brings you to 5th Avenue. There are so many resaurants and theatres right outside the door. You really can't get a better location. After returning from the Bus Tour our rooms were ready. I entered, holding my breath, but immediately let out a sigh of relief after opening the door. The room wasn't huge, but large enough for 4 women and their luggage and their shopping bags. The beds were clean and very comfy. The bathroom was clean and looked to be recently renovated. As others have mentioned the air-conditioning is noisy, and is a window unit. This makes for more noise if your room is facing the street. Request a room at the back as garbage pick-up is during the night and is VERY noisy. The elevator is indeed slow, so request a low room and take the stairs much more quickly. The deli next door is great. Taxi's are readily available at all times of the day or night. The 42nd street subway station is in walking distance. When you leave the property you have to leave your 1 and only key at the front desk. This was a bit unnerving as I would have been much more confident taking care of my own key.

The rooms on the inner courtyard don't have any window locks on the window - which freaked us out a little since the windows are on the fire escapes. The air conditioner worked fine. No exhaust vents in the bathroom which made for a steamy after shower. The elevator was incredibly slow, so we took the stairs most of the time. We spent the first night in a queen room and due to construction across the inner courtyard, asked to be moved. The hotel front desk was very accommodating and let us pick our new room. They also reserved a car for the ride to the airport with no problems at all. A few tips: the Cranberry Deli is 2 doors away and is open 24 hours. They have a huge selection of food - buffet chinese/salad, pizza by the slice, wraps, sandwiches, sushi even! Plus they make the best breakfast sandwiches and burritos to go, that are super cheap!

At the end of the street, there's a \"City Sightings\" tour vendor. I highly recommend this \"hop-on-hop-off\" bus tour! It's much cheaper than buying individual tickets for each attraction. 3* for COMFORT - Our room was on the 11th floor in the back. It was small but efficient. The room was old but clean. There were no curtains for the bathroom windows. The bottom half of the bathroom window wasn't transparent though. Hotel furnished soaps and shampoo but NO HAIR DRYER! You must request one from the front desk. I had problems regulating the shower temperature, but staff were quick to resolve the issue. No coffee, but close to several delis and McDonalds where you can buy some. Bed was clean and comfortable. Our room was quiet! The door was old and the key got jammed a few times. I had to wiggle the key a bit to lock or unlock the door and to get the key out. The elevator was SLOW and made clicking noises as you passed each floor, but efficient. 4* for CLEANLINESS - I would've given this hotel 5* for cleanliness had their not been long hair on the walls. It looked like a girl with long hair dried her hair and it stuck to the wall behind her. Not too gross, only a few strands. 4* for STAFF - The front desk people were helpful and kind. When I entered my room, there was an envelope asking for tips for the cleaning ladies. I thought this was a bit rude as it's their job to clean and besides, my room wasn't immaculate. I stayed for 2 days so I put a \"do not disturb\" sign on my door so they didn't have to come in clean. It's good for the environment anyway to reuse my same sheets and towels. After check out the staff stored my luggage for me for a few hours until I went o the airport. 4* for PRICE - It's New York City, so everything is overpriced. However, it was the cheapest I could find. I booked through Hotel Connexions. Other hotels were priced between $300-$400 per night, and I only paid a bit more than $300 for 2 nights! 5* OVERALL - I had a pleasant overall experience. I hope my review is thorough enough to help you decide if the Hotel St. James is right for you. This hotel provides the very basics and not more. If you're familar with the European Formule 1 hotel chain - Hotel St. James is just a step up. The only difference is that you get your own bathroom, privacy, soap and shampoo.

We had tickets to Pajama Game and wanted a good deal on a hotel so we could enjoy the City for the night without husbands and kids. I booked the hotel after reading some horrible reviews. So I went into it expecting the worst and figuring if it was so bad, we would stay elsewhere that night. I got into the City a couple of hours before check-in time so I could take a look around just in case we had to jump ship!! I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw the lobby mostly renovated. Yes, there are two areas in the lobby that are still under construction, but it certainly was not a turn-off. I figured I would have to wait to check in since I was there so ahead of time, but they gave me the key immediately, and I headed up to the 6th floor to Room 614. Elevators where a little slow, but so what, it's an old building. They were clean and escalated upward smoothly. The hallway had a little bit of a stale smoke smell but nothing too offensive!! I entered the room a little nervously and was again pleasantly surprised at the condition. The bathroom was spotlessly clean, new white tiles, new pedestal sink, new toilet and clean shower!! The living area was spacious with a faux fireplace, clean carpeting, clean sheets and bedspread and freshly painted walls. There was plenty of storage for clothing as well with an armoire, dresser and nightstand. The television looked brand new and worked just fine. The bed itself was nice and firm; probably near new. The pillows were horrible.....so what though....just ask for some additional ones!! We felt very safe as well. Locks on the doors worked just fine. It was very quiet during the night. We slept soundly and never heard any other guests or noises from the elevators. The only real offensive thing was a large garbage bag in the hallway that was left for guests to dump their garbage into. It sat there all day into the evening. So we decided to take it upon ourselves to send the garbage on a ride into the elevator to the first floor!! We figured that once it got down there and the elevator door opened someone at the front desk would get the picture!! The location of the hotel was amazing!! You are right there in Times Square, right in the middle of the theater district, access to some great restaurants and shopping. You will probably run into the \"Naked Cowboy\" who is spotted walking around the streets of NYC in just cowboy boots, underwear and a cowboy hat!! It is a 15 minute walk from Penn Station to the hotel. You can hit Macy's on the way. We dined at Trattoria TreColori which is right on the same block as the hotel. We had no idea when walking in that the restaurant is so well-known and absolutely delicious!! Not pricey at all. We shared an appetizer, salad and each had a delicious entree for $54 which included tax. It was a friendly place, could be romantic...really perfect for dining with a special person. There are two great delis right next door to the hotel...Dunhill Cafe (I had lunch there) and Cranberry Deli (We had breakfast there the next morning). Great food and amazingly inexpensive. We got pedicures around the block at Vogue Nails (46th between 5th & 6th). Definitely a girly weekend!! Would I stay there again????? ABSOLUTELY.

Our only real complaint and I felt that it was a big enough one to cause me to stay elsewhere in May when I go back with my son is, that our room #411 had no dresser. Only a small closet that you almost couldn't get open far enough because of the bed. Not even a luggage rack. When we asked about a dresser we were informed that they didn't have any. Maybe when they finish renovating they will. I would definetly stay there again if I could get my clothes out of a suitcase. For one or two days it's not a big deal but for 5 or 6 it is.

Looking through mixed reviews of budget hotels, we settled on the St. James. We are 2 women who are flirting with 50,like to have fun, and have champagne tastes on a beer budget. We were looking for something clean, safe and close to Times Square.I made reservations directly with the hotel, getting a rate of $145 per night for a Thursday and Friday stay. This was $15 lower than quoted on Expedia, Travelocity, etc. We drove (YIKES!) into New York City at 2:00pm on Thursday afternoon. Right down 42nd Street and through Times Square. Found the Saint James pretty easily by their address, though they had no sign. A little intimidated by just stopping traffic to unload and check in, so we pulled into a lot about 1/2 block down the street, where they let us park for 1/2 hour so we could check in. Check in went quickly and we were in the room in just a few minutes. The lobby was ok, it looked like they may be trying to add a little lounge in the back. Two very small elevators, one with lights in the ceiling that made it like a sauna, but they arrived quickly with no problems. This hotel is very old, and the hallways reflected this, but they were clean. Our room was a good size for New York City, with one queen sized bed, and even a fireplace, non-working of course, but it gave the room some charm. The furniture was new but simple, and the carpet and linens were clean.The bathroom was a decent size, and clean as well. This hotel was no frills, but turned out to be exactly what we were looking for. In the short block we walked to get to the middle of Times Square, there was a great Irish pub called O'Lunneys, where we had a light meal of soup and a smoked salmon appetizer that was wonderful. Also on our block was the Trattoria Trecolori, a small Italian restaurant with WONDERFUL food! This was our \"splurge\" dinner. We each had a glass of wine. My friend had the clams casino, and I had an amazing carpaccio. For our entree, we shared an order of carbonara, which they split for us in the kitchen. I cannot begin to say how good this meal was. Our bill for 2 including tip was only $70. All the wait staff and the manager were very gracious and friendly. Also right next to the hotel was the Cranberry Deli, where you could pick up anything from bottled water and pop, to great looking breakfast and lunch sandwiches made to order. The best part of the deli was in the back where they had a beautiful salad bar and hot food buffet. It was beautifully presented, and was available for carry out. All in all, we had a wonderful time. Right down the block to Times Square, hop on the subway, and we were in Chinatown and Little Italy in no time. An easy walk to both Rockefeller Center and the Theater district. If you are looking for a budget hotel, close to the action, this is it. The one drawback was no close parking. We parked about 2 blocks away, and were lucky to find a garage for $38 per night. We worked this out with only a little hassle, as 2 garages turned us away, because they didn't have an \"agreement\" with the St. James.

And of course, they told us there were no rooms to move us to even though people contiued to check in after us (many I saw later at the front desk complaining). The next morning we had hot water after letting the faucet run for about 10 minutes, but the hot water only lasted for about 2 minutes. The walls are paper thin and the doors slam like a prison lockdown. The front desk clerks were rude, inconsiderate and very unhelpful. They didn't seem at all concerned that we didn't have hot water and went so far as to tell me we were the only ones that complained about no hot water. However, I asked a group in the lobby if they had hot water and they said previously they had the same problem, but were moved to a top floor and didn't notice it so much. We were on the 3rd floor and the entire second floor was torn up with renovations. This hotel definitely has issues. I never felt very safe there, and if I were to go again, I would spend an additional $50/night just to have hot water and feel safe in a hotel with a staff that cared about their customers' concerns.

Recent reviews emphasize the location of this hotel and seem to be saying that the proximity to Times Square outweighs the many shortfalls of this hotel. I beg to differ. My wife and I have stayed at a number of New York City hotels, of various classes and in different parts of the city. If location is your major concern, there are other hotels close to the St. James that are in the same price category and offer a very nice level of comfort. A two star hotel should offer a certain base level of service, and that level is missing at the St. James. So the argument that you get what you pay for doesn't hold here -- you should get much more for the price of this hotel. Here's what my wife and I expect as basics in a hotel, even a two star hotel, that were missing at the St. James: 1) A helpful staff: The people working at the St. James range from friendly (the maids and one desk clerk) to rude (the owner, the manager, and another desk clerk were especially rude). 2) Honest representation: The hotels provide info on their properties to the web sites and the travel agents. That info should be accurate, as should the photographs. In fact, this hotel does not have room service, wedding facilities, a restaurant, or a concierge. 3) Amenities: an extra roll of toilet paper, wash cloths, the little shampoo and lotion bottles, a phone that works and temperature control in the room all make a stay more comfortable. These are basics, found in virtually every reputable hotel. But not at the St. James. 4) Safety and cleanliness: Even a two star hotel should have an elevator that works reliably, and trash that is removed from the hallway regularly. The smoke detector in our room was broken, as was the toilet. And the stains on the floor and the sheets hardly reassured my wife and I that the hotel was clean. It also smelled bad, very bad. True, there is a Starbuck's half a block away, and a deli next door, and the subway is close by. But I think what's inside the hotel is what you pay for, and there are comparably priced hotels in the same area as the St. James that offer a basic level of service and comfort.

May 2005\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3482895", "Content": "The St James Hotel Times Square is pretty much what it says it is - a budget hotel. I have read some rather bad reviews of the place, so was a little nervous about going there. However, the location and price made me take the risk. So, I booked two rooms, one for my parents who were visiting the USA for the first time. Unlike many who have commented here, I was not disappointed. Sure, the place is in the midst of an overhaul. That is apparent from the outside, since the facade is being worked on. The lobby is a 'work in progress', with a nice little front desk and a less than nice plastic bag storage area. Check in was smooth, and the desk clerk was efficient if not overly friendly. The elevators are clearly still to be upgraded. They are a bit slow and noisy. But they do get you where you need to be. Our rooms were on the 5th floor, which appears to have been renovated already. They were both clean and tidy, and featured comfortable beds. There were only a few TV channels, but I was not there to watch TV so it didn't matter to me. The bathroom was small, but more than adequate. There was soap provided, but you need to bring shampoo. Some people have mentioned that the towels were rough. That is true, they are not luxurious. So if that is the kind of thing that bothers you, don't stay here. The hot water in the shower came, but patience was required one morning. We were staying there in May, when it was not hot in NYC. I suspect that in the summer one might over heat in some rooms, since they don't all feature A/C (yet). And the windows are not double glazed, so rooms at the front can potentially be noisy during the early morning commute to work. This would be worse if you try to cool down with an open window. This is in the heart of Midtown, afterall. So for a summer stay you might want to check ahead to see if you are going to get A/C. The hotel is still being renovated, so you will notice signs of this. Coming down the stairs you will see that the second floor looks like a bomb hit it. Also, the housekeeping staff often have their carts in the lobby by the elevators, presumably because the rear area of the first floor is still being renovated. These things didn't bother me though, because in my room I had a good bed, clean towels and sheets, and a private bathroom. No alarm clock though, so you'll have to make arrangements for that. I just used my cellphone alarm. For food, there are restaurants in and near Times Sq, and there is a very nice deli just outside the hotel. Basically, you get what you pay for. If you want to have extra luxuries, go to the big hotels down the road, and pay $50-100 more per night. Or, go an hour out of the city to New Jersey or one of the airport hotels. If comfortable and basic is ok for you, the St James is fine in my opinion. And, I might add, will only get better as the renovations are completed.

I read the reviews and knew that the St. James was a risk but decided to take that risk. That was one of the worst mistakes I've ever made in family travel. We had talked to the hotel staff for weeks about the need for a renovated room, a safe place to leave luggage for early arrival, and other details. From the moment we arrived things went badly. No safe place for luggage... only out in the open lobby. We left our luggage and upon return someone had changed our room request. They had 4 of us in a queen bed room and said WE had changed our request to that day. Ludicrous! We finally got two doubles after confronting their lies. Renovated room was dirty. Hair everywhere. Stains on carpet, towels, even the tip envelope. No hand or wash towels. Broken toilet. Leaking radiator. The staff was not helpful and some were quite rude. I've never written a bad review for any place I've stayed but had to warn others. If you're simply looking for a place to sleep and quality absolutely does not matter then the St. James may work for you. I was not intersted in paying big bucks for a 4/5 star hotel. For a little more money however, we found a great place on 47th. We had no choice but to stay one night at the St. James but I walked away from a prepaid second night and found the other place to stay. Losing that second night was the best money I spent. My advice - find an extra 40 to 50 dollars per night.

Its location is 109 W. 45th Street in mid-town Manhattan. They have recently undergone some renovations according to their website. Even so, it is not handicap accessible -- one needs to go up 3-4 granite steps and a heavy door in order to get into the facility. The lobby was relatively small with a check-in desk about 8 feet in length. There are two elevators to take guests up to the rooms. Beyond the lobby was another large open area filled with lots of used furniture piled several feet high and looked rather unsightly. There was also a small glassed-in area --approx. 6' X 6' and right next to the desk -- for patrons to leave their luggage if they arrive before the check-in time of 3:00 p.m. We were allowed up to our room when we arrived at 2:00 p.m. The lobby itself had only two chairs and a room-size roll of carpet placed alongside the wall. The employee who checked us in was well-dressed and professional and pleasant. The check-in process was about three minutes. We were not offered a second key for our room -- even though there were 4 of us. No discounts were available for guests. Two in our group were senior citizens, two are members of AAA and I am a school teacher. We were told that none were offered at all -- ever. Our room (on the 6th floor) had two double beds, a closet and bathroom. The room was very clean and painted a lovely shade of Christmas-tree green. We were disappointed that there was not even a small refrigerator nor an ice bucket for us (three of us in our group need to take meds at bed-time and/or early morning) nor any kind of snack/drink machine. The room had no air-condioner. Not that it was broken, there simply wasn't one. We arrived during an April \"heatwave\" where it went up to 85 during the day and made the room quite uncomfortable to sleep in (NOTE: bugs don't fly that high but birds do). There was neither table nor desk in the room and just one chair in a room for 4. The windows (2) were unscreened and any items placed on the wide windowsill had to be placed so that they did not fall out of the windows when open. The TV had good reception but only got about 12 channels and had no viewer guide channel for us to determine which stations were which or which shows were on. The hotel has no restaurants or snack bar; no continental breakfast, coffee or morning newspaper. It is a 12-story facility. Check-out time is at Noon and for us it was a three-minute process after we handed in the key and the employee checked our bill to see if there were any additional charges. We were told, however, they were \"not allowed\" to call us a cab so that we could get to the Port Authority on 42nd street in order to catch our bus. We had to walk to the corner (about 100 feet) with all of our luggage and try our luck at hailing a cab. About 20 went past us -- already in use. We finally got one and arrived at Port Authority in plenty of time. Yes, I would stay there again, but I'd bring a fan. We stayed for 2 nights at a cost of $165.00 (taxes included) per night -- not bad when dividing the amount by 4 guests. I had booked the room for our group -- sight unseen -- directly with the hotel (by phone) although I found out about the hotel through an online travel/hotel site.

Lamp didn't work and window wouldn't close, but they fixed it quickly. Slow elevators, but so what, all of NYC has very old bldgs here. Took the narrow stairs sometimes, just remember some floors are still under construction. The staff was very friendly and accomodating to us. Plenty of towels. Only about 15 cable chanels, but who cares, I'm out touring NYC, not watching TV. I don't know what all the grief is about with these other reviewers. Give me a break, wonderful price and location. Quaint eateries down the street, subway close. Who needs 3/4/5 star hotels at the expensive rates they want, not us ? If you want to pay $200+/night, good for you, but that's not smart as far as I'm concerned. Next time I'm in NYC, I'd go back here for sure. Hope their rates don't go up to much by then.

Expedia should be ashamed, advertising this hotel as something it definitely is not. Relying on the hotel to provide a description of the premises, Expedia advertises this hotel to be a 2-star hotel with a restaurant that provides room service and cable/satellite TV, a concierge desk, a smoke-free property, and WEDDING SERVICES (heaven help the honeymooners who pick this hotel!). The only truth in advertising here is that the location is great, very central to Times Square and Fifth Ave. Otherwise, this hotel is the pits. First, to all those who say it's a good value, we've stayed at other 2-star hotels in or near Times Square, sometimes for much less than we paid for this one, and the rooms are clean, well-stocked, with actual concierge service and restaurants. You DON'T have to pay twice as much to get a decent hotel, and it's rubbish to think $150 a night is a deal for a really unsatisfactory hotel. Here's what we faced: The eleventh floor is a disaster. The doorknob was broken and there were no inside latches. If there had been a fire, our only hope would have been to jump, because the phone didn't work and the stairs were broken, if we could have found them without a map of the hotel fixed to the inside of the door (every other hotel I have ever stayed in has this feature, except the Hotel St. James). The elevators were a gamble, at best. Using a bathroom where the drains are plugged with years worth of people's hair is pretty disgusting. It's not a lot of fun to use a toilet facing a window without any curtains or shades, either. We were moved to the third floor eventually, which was better but still lacked the features that would make this even a 1-star hotel. The lack of temperature controls in the rooms means you are at the mercy of the front desk, and you either end up roasting or freezing, but it's not of your own choosing. The TV had only a few channels available, and since we don't speak Italian, two stations were definitely not applicable to us. And sheets that have stains (hate to think of the source) and cigarette burns are pretty disgusting. No washcloths or toilet paper on the third floor either. The maid was nice, as was one young lady working at the desk, otherwise the employees were unhelpful and some were downright rude. We think the plexiglass enclosure is to keep people from spitting at the office help, which in frustration you might be tempted to do. Some of the people there are just plain rude. The owner is an old French woman who doesn't care in the least that the rooms have no extra toilet paper or wash cloths, or that the \"non-smoking\" rooms actually have ashtrays, and smell of smoke and urine. We know this for a fact because we tried to talk to her about how unhappy we were. Her response to complaints is that you ought to have checked out the first night and gone elsewhere. My suggestion is don't bother with the first night, just go somewhere else. You can enjoy the convenience of a 2-star hotel in Times Square without sacrificing cleanliness, service, and a few amenities (like soap or toilet paper). This experience has made us very wary of using internet booking sites such as Expedia, at least without checking out customer reviews on sites such as this one. The photos posted on these sites are obviously sent in by the hotel, and were either taken 30 years ago or are from another property. The sites provide little help once you've actually checked in, and our credit card company said if you stay longer than 30 minutes after check-in, they won't make an adjustment on your account.

It has lots of problems. My first clue that we had made a mistake was the plexiglass enclosure they use in lieu of the normal lobby desk. My second was the old-fashioned key instead of the access cards that have been used for many years now. We checked in to the room and it was quite reasonable. The bathroom was fairly new and clean, however there were no face cloths or hand towels, strangely enough, only bath towels. They doubled as all the rest, including as a bath mat. Fortunately, the next morning we met the maid as she was doing our room. She was a young Polish student (who hated New York and was returning to Poland shortly) and very helpful. She found face cloths, extra pillows, extra towels, extra toilet paper, lots of soap and an extra waste basket for us. After giving her a nice tip, we found our room to be well-cleaned and supplied the rest of our stay, which was a total of 5 nights. The staff I found to be very indifferent. When I went down to complain about something, it was as if they didn't care. Perhaps they get these complaints so often that it's like water off a duck's back! My biggest beef is against the internet sites that sell these hotel rooms - hotel and expedia. They are blatently lying about the amenities available, and I will never use them again: - air conditioning. There was none in our room. - concierge. No! - room service. Not a chance when there's no restaurant, as advertised. - business services available. What's that? A telephone? Certainly there was nothing else. - dry cleaning service. I think not! - hair dryer. No! - individual climate control. The nearest thing I saw to this was the old valve that I had to shut off to stop the heat and the clanking from the pipes. Having said all that, after the first day we more or less accepted what we had and made the best of it, laughing at some of the things mentioned above. It is very handy to Times Square and Broadway. We were there for the sights and shows, and were never far from out hotel room. My last beef had to do with the unavailabilty of a receipt when I checked out. I was told that since I booked online, they were responsible for sending me a receipt, and had done so, by e-mail. Obviously the young man who told me this does not know the difference between a confirmation and a receipt. In any event, he would not give me one. If I lived in the USA, I might refer this this to the IRS as this hotel could be playing games with their receipts. The bottom line is that I would never stay there again.
