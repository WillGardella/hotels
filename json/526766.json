I booked 2 doubles for my husband and I/sister and boyfriend and 1 single for my Mom during our 3 days in Tokyo as part of our family vacation in late October 2008. We all LOVED the Hotel Monterey Ginza! First, location couldn't be beat, it was great to be in the heart of Ginza with all the wonderful high-end shopping and so close to the train and subway stations. The hotel itself was very modern and definitely had a boutique atmosphere. The dark wood combined with French pictures and the French music as soon as I opened the door into the hallway made me feel transported to a French boulevard! The staff was very helpful and had pre-made maps to show us where to exchange money and even good restaurants to try. The room itself was VERY comfortable and a good size, with more toiletry options than I've ever seen (including hair clips!) and the air system, toilet, TV, everything was so modern! It also had a great Wi-fi internet connection that was very convenient for us. Best of all, the price was definitely right! It was a GREAT base for Tokyo and I will stay there again!", "Date": "Nov 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR551969339", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Jiru"}, {"Content": "Good value, clean and nice.

This hotel is right in the heart of Ginza area. II took the JR line to Tokyo station and then took a taxi to the hotel. If you are travelling to this hotel for the first time and not familier with the Japan Subway system, then I would recommend the same. Once I got to the hotel and got a feel for the place, it was a breeze for me to take the subway. The closest subway entrance is about 1 minute by walk from the hotel. The hotel was very clean and the staff were extremly efficient. The check in and check out were fast. The staff all spoke English and were helpful in giving directions, tips on using the subway, shopping recommendations, etc. I booked the hotel room with the breakfast package which I recommend. The breakfast was fantastic and had both Japanese and European breakfast. The room came with hi-speed internet access and it was included in my room rate. The rooms were small compared to American standards, but it was plenty for a me. The bathroom was nice with heated toilet seat and was very clean. The hotel did not have any safes in the room, but they do have a service which allows you to leave your valuables with the hotel.

Me and my husband enjoyed an amazing time there from the moment we arrived. The service was great, with a very polite and helpful staff, although a little Japanese knowledge is useful since their English-speaking skills are not that great. They can say good morning and enjoy your stay, but when I asked them to recharge my MP3 at their computer's USB, they were kind of lost, just like the time when I tried to ask them to call me a cab: I ended up doing that in Japanese. As far as location is concerned, it just couldn't be better. You are minutes away from the main hubs in the terrible hell of the Tokyo subway, so it's really easy to travel with as less connections as possible, and the streets around the place are crowded not only with shops but with great cozy, Japanese, low-priced restaurants, as well as the best of all: two convenience stores opened 24 hours a day right in front of the hotel doors, so you can buy a banana, a face mask or a bottle of water whenever you need to.We had a double room and it was fully equipped with anything from a big kettle to a proper hairdryer, and a flat-screen TV, although the closet was kind of small for our 10-days stay. The bed was great, and the bathroom had anything you could ask for, from hair clips to a warm WC seat!! We didn't have breakfast or any meal included so I can't provide an opinion on that, but my guess is the restaurant was good from what I heard from other guests.There are internet facilities free of charge in the reception area, which was great for us since our cell phones didn't work while we were there.We spent a night away at the Hakone National Park and we couldn't wait to go back to the Monterey Ginza, we ended up calling it home, because that is exactly what it felt like.All in all, it was a great experience and very affordable, I would truly recommend it to anyone.Virginia", "Date": "Jan 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR725268638", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Vdelacruz"}, {"Content": "a tokyo gem A gem of a hotel right in the centre of Tokyo.Small reception area staff very friendly polite and helpful.Subway station seconds walk Tokyo main railway station 10mins walk and Ginza shopping area 2mins walk.Rooms small well appointed and air conditioned (this is important in Tokyo ) bed was a bit neat for a european frame but comfortable nevertheless hotel quiet.Restaurant a bit pricey but area is surrounded by restaurants bars coffee shops and a couple convenience stores accross street which are open 24/7.", "Date": "Nov 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR407598038", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "manwithsuitcase"}, {"Content": "Other Monterey Hotels Much Better Monterey Hotels in Japan are known for European style and reasonable cost. I've stayed at the Monterey in Sapporo and in Sendai (both great experiences) and the Ginza Monterey simple doesn't compare.

The TV had BBC World but every time I hit the sub button for English it reverted to Japanese within a minute. And I was requested to pay the equivalent of $500 U.S. upfront (without even seeing my room) as 'policy of the hotel', despite the fact that I have both a permanent Japanese address and solid Japanese ability. A credit card imprint was not enough, I was billed the moment I signed in. This is the only hotel to ever request that of me in Japan and I've lived here for 11 years.

Hotel staff were hospitable and helpful. As per other reviews, don't take the breakfast; it's not worth $20. Try the McDonald's or Starbuck's, both a minute or two away by foot.The room itself is simple yet comfortable and ultraclean. I asked for a quiet room and found myself on the 12th floor, far above any of the minor traffic noise below; it's a very quiet area in any event. But a mere five minutes away and you are on Ginza Dori, the Oxford Street or Park Aveneue of Tokyo. Connections from the nearby Ginza metro (exit 13 is most convenient to hotel) are excellent.

With one subway line, the Ginza It-chome, just a minute's walk away, and the main Ginza line about a 7-9 minute walk away, it was very convenient.
