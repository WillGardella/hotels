I asked for a wake up call for 6am - as a backup to my own alarms and it never came. My alarm woke me up at 5:45, and the receptionist claimed to give me a wake up call 10 minutes before the actual time I asked for a wake up call - which was actually a lie. She then tried to convince me that i'd answered the call saying i'm already awake, and then she came to check on me at 6am to see if I was awake - none of this happened. I don't think the receptionist knew what a wake up call was to be honest. I don't even think my phone was working either. Just blatant lying going on there, and she wasn't even at reception in the morning - I had to phone her in her room and she couldn't be bothered to check me out of my room. Room was a bit cramped, and on the 4th floor - a bit of a nightmare as I had bags too. No offer to help me up the stairs either. Note - there is no lift, and the stairways and corridors are narrow. Space mattress on really low bed was actually quite uncomfortable somehow. TV was ok, it worked at least. It didn't have a good range of channels though - 1-3 UK channels and the rest were foreign. Real mish mash of stuff. There was no offer of free wifi - i'd at least expect that in a 4*. Not even a mention if any wifi was available. Flooring on 4th floor looked like it had been done recently, and doesnt match the carpet of the other floors, so I was woken up in the middle of the night by people arriving and all I could hear were footsteps on the wooden floor. Bathroom came with soaps and shampoo which were a welcome surprise. When I asked for a taxi to be booked, receptionist quickly stopped me mid sentence with how much cheaper their taxi's were compared to getting a black cab and offered me a cab straight to Heathrow for \u00a345. I wasn't going to heathrow at all. Once I told her where I was going, she said get a taxi outside. Nice. Luckily, I only stayed a night. Would recommend going to travelodge more than this place, at least they have friendly staff. Just avoid this place altogether.

I never felt to write review as I don\u2019t care this issues much. But when I was going through hotel reviews I make up my mind to write my experience of stay in opulence. First of all if this hotel was that bad I would not have been here for the fifth time. This time I was here for 5 nights n as soon as i was in the hotel the young reception guy welcomed me as we were quite familiar to eachother in my last stay. He gave me the room in third floor. The room was more better than last time I stayed(6 mths before). The room was clean, neat and tidy. I don\u2019t think most of the hotels provide molton brown stuffs which opulence does .There was wood in the room instead of carpet and bathrooms were more decorated. I was very happy with the room improvement. As I am a regular guest they offered me a senior suite for my last two days stay in the same price which was happily accepted by me. I was really happy with the rooms. The double room was good in its place but senior suite was much more amazing. I really enjoyed my trip. Though the timing for breakfast is late the breakfast served by the young always smiling chef was really good. The guest just next to me said in the room that she never had this type of good omelette in her life. I didnt tried the omelette but the fried egg was good too. For me opulence is the nice hotel whatever the reviews says. I will be coming back to opulence whenever I am in London for sure.

The net curtain was beyond filthy, but as it was attached by a bit of velcro it was easy to take down and hide in the wardrobe. There was a kettle I admit, but no tea, coffee, milk or sugar. But that was alright because you couldn't fit the kettle under the bathroom tap in any case. Oh yes, the bathroom: this was a very small triangular corner of the room containing a miniscule shower which got to lukewarm after 5 minutes. The only cooked item for breakfast was eggs.

My son booked a single room (via Booking.Com) for me in this hotel and a double room for my brother and his wife who were visiting from South Africa. It was booked on the strength of it being a four star hotel but it was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in and totally ruined our London visit. We found out too late that the Opulence website is a total load of codswallop. There is NO room service, NO tea making facilities, NO \"in-room\" spa (whatever that may be) and no way guests could get a drink, not even a cup of tea. There were no telephones in the rooms, and to speak to anyone at the \"reception desk\" you had to climb a flight of stairs if you were on the ground floor. The bedspread and cushion in my room was dirty and stained and the bathrobe had make-up on the front and the sleeve. When I complained I was told there was no housekeeper available until the next day. The bedspread was replaced the following day and the bathrobe removed but not replaced. The carpet was dirty and the curtains were tatty. The shower was filthy and brown round the outside and there was no glass for teeth cleaning in either room. We had to buy plastic cups! Breakfast was the worst meal I have ever had in a hotel and I have stayed in plenty! There was no full English available, bacon or sausage was a definite no-no. The \"continental buffet\" saw the same limp food put out two days on the trot. But there were eggs!! However, the \"chef\" did not know how long to boil them for so they were dished up like golf balls. There were no egg cups, so they were served on plates. This hotel has a very pleasant facade when viewed from the pavement and that is all it has to recommend it. If it really has four stars it makes the entire star rating system a farce.

On entering the hotel the first thing I noticed was the dirty carpet on a staircase, the balustrade more chips out of the paintwork than there was paint. There was nothing else there, I then heard a voice say come up here. So I climbed up a staircase to a landing where the reception was more like a cupboard with a dirty silk flower arrangement sitting on a shelf (not even a desk more like a cubby hole).

After checking in the receptionist said he would take me to my room. Climbing three equally dirty, dark and shabby staircases I explained that I could not manage all these stairs due to by back problems. He then told me that I was on the fifth floor and there were two more flights to go! When I asked about a lift he responded that it was an Victorian building more like a home than a hotel! I then explained that it was impossible for me to stay here as I could not manage to go up and down five flights of stairs and that I would have to find somewhere else. He told me that I had to pay for the room as I had not given 48 hours notice of cancellation. I said that this was not a normal cancellation but the fact that I could not manage the stairs and that their website had been totally misleading. I then went outside and called Central R, the booking agent, who were very sympathetic and said I would not be charged for the hotel and would get a full refund if any charges were taken from my credit card. This was followed by an email confirmation that a refund would be given. Four weeks later \u00a393 had been taken from my card by Opulence Hotel.

After insistant complaining, we ended up with the superior room which was bigger and at a glance, far nicer.

The hotel is NOTHING like it looks on the pictures, and there are no minibars, hairdryers or, in fact, any of the things it has listed on the website.

There was no air in the room and no air conditioning or fan. They repeatedly asked for a fan and were told that there were none available. In the end, they were so uncomfortable, I gave them my fan as my room was marginally more airy than theirs.

When they requested a move the next day, they were told that they had agreed to stay in the basement, which was untrue. The hotel needs a good clean, especially the stairwells.

It was an exhausting climb! My respectable, elderly friends only managed to reach their room by stopping midway and on one occasion climbing the last flight on all fours!! Whilst, room 6 was a twin, room 7 resembled a single room, albeit with a double bed. The hope of an additional single bed being put in the room did not materialise nor was there space even to accommodate such! There was only one bedside table and lamp, one bath robe and one pair of slippers \u2013 hence our suspicion we were being crammed into a single room. Room 7 was stifling hot despite the window being opened wide and our request for a fan could not be met by the reception staff member \u2013 (room 6 had an air-conditioning unit). We asked for hand towels as only bath towels had been provided- these never appeared until the following day. We also reported the television control unit was not working \u2013this was not repaired during our stay! We could not make use of the safe as it had been left locked. We did pass on all these complaints to the manageress, Mona and to be fair, we then did get hand towels, a portable fan was provided, a security key for the safe was handed to us, but no action taken on the tv control unit. Our friends in room 6 were a little more fortunate as the facilities did work, although there was a broken socket (see pic) and the shower tray proved too slippery for one of the ladies The breakfast arrangements were slapdash \u2013 self serve cereal, toast, juice and coffee, we were offered a hot breakfast of scrambled eggs, fried eggs or omelette.

Also, they promise something like over 20 TV channels, I found maybe 3 that were in English, and the pay TV didn't work, so no chance of watching a film, and there was no menu for room service. I checked out the next day and wanted to put my bags in luggage storage. I was told there was a door on the basement that led the baggage storage. I walked in, there was no security, or lock on the door, and it was a narrow little walkway filled with rubbish and a ladder and an old suitcase with nothing in it. Wonderful! When I went to retrieve my bags there was a huge pile of rubbish outside the door. The only thing helpful the reception did was get me a cheap cab to Heathrow, but I left a good 5 hours before my flight only because I was scared about leaving my bags in that room.", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNot good value\u201d", "Author": "sunshinesmiler2010", "ReviewID": "UR56059977", "Content": "My boyfriend booked this in a misguided valentines treat.

A suite it was not!! It was a large room but it was not a suite. Also he paid up front so we couldn't even check out and go somewhere else.

Booked this hotel over the internet on the strength of is web site and the fact it was on laterooms. We arrived at about 730pm and waited for 20 mins for someone to attend the reception desk, in the end I had to hunt through the hotel to locate a member of staff. The receptionist insisted that we had to pay for our stay in advance rather than just a pre-authorisation. She then issued us with our keys and told us where the room was located, no offer of help with bags or any intention of coming with us to show us our room. Once we got to our room I found out why, its was disgusting, the bathroom hadn't been cleaned in months, paper and paint peeling of the walls and ceiling everywhere as well as the heating not working. Even the wardrobe was broken, went I went to complain about the state of the room I then had to find the member of staff again. She apologised and immediately offered us another room, \"great\" I thought no ifs or buts just fix the problem. NO the second room was worse than the first with damp stains(i assume) over the ceiling, walls and carpets and still the same disgusting state of cleanliness just bigger and more mess. When we said this was no better she offered us a bigger room which was even in a worse state that the previous 2. It was at this point I demanded my money back so we could leave this took a further hour of arguing with someone describing himself as the manager . They refused to refund my credit card and in the end after threats of police involvement and legal action they scrabbled around and came up with a cash refund. If there is one thing that I could wish for it wouldn't be world peace it would be that no one ever has to stay in this flea pit.", "Date": "December 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cDisgusting!\u201d", "Author": "neveragain31", "ReviewID": "UR49659091", "Content": "Filthy place, apparently now being used by London Council to house asylum seekers.

The customer service from this place is the worse I have ever encountered. I booked a room and then hours before my stay they cancelled on me on a very busy weekend, so finding another hotel at such short notice was difficult. But the worst was to come. Days later after looking at my bank statement I noticed that they had still charged me! An honest mistake I thought... But when I phoned them the rude staff (especially the manager) told me I was charged because I did not show, even thought they had cancelled on me! They refused to give me my money back. They told me I would have to speak to the booking agency or the go between Hotel Solutions. They refused to discuss the matter even when I explained that it was their mistake. In all my years (39) I have never experienced such poor customer service. Fortunately, after 2 months of haggling and endless phone calls and a word with Trading Standards Hotel Solutions kindly gave me my money back even though it wasn't there place to do so. The Opulence Hotel refused to acknowledge their mistake or refund me. It's not what the Opulence Hotel did to me but it's the way they did it that is so disgraceful! They were rude and arrogant.

The reception is a shack, in effect stuffed into a corner, it was a shambles. The carpets are filthy and stained and were not fitted - as a consequence the edges were all tattered. The trip to the room (god help you if you are at the top as we were) was via a staircase which was poorly maintained (wall-paper peeling off, water stains down the wall). The room was terrible. The carpet was again stained and poorly fitted. the bedding was a disgrace and I threw the top cover into the wardrobe, where it stayed. The net curtain was grey with filth. The shower leaked all over the floor and was crammed into a space that my husband could not turn round in. You could not get to the sink properly because it was so crammed. The television did have 25 channels, however 24 of them did not have a reception. If there is a fire and you are the top, make sure that you have made a will because you will never get out unless you use the net curtains to paracute out! The receptionist was there from dawn to dusk but we did our best not to wake him when we came back at 10am to find him snoring laying on top of his reception shack. I would not rely on him for security or any form of fire warning system. The best way to navigate the room is to back into the shower and then jump onto the bed to dry off - thereby avoiding the carpet! To top it off two pillows with no pillow cases.
