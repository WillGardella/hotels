We checked in around 11pm and the (young) man at the front desk was great- efficient, a bit friendly but not fake, and accommodating. My husband smokes once in a while and we were considering getting a smoking room but I didn't want to sleep in a stinky ashtray. The clerk offered to show us the room so we ran up the three flights of stairs (there were a few other customers in line behind us and no elevator), I smelled the room, it was fine, we ran back down and we got the room. The room definitely felt like a small efficiency studio where B actors once lived, which means it was pretty large for a hotel room. The bed was fine, tv good, mini-fridge convenient, the toiletries in the bathroom much appreciated and free parking in the back a nice bonus. We may have heard noises from the adjacent rooms but nothing major. We had a view of the automobile repair shop across the street but in the morning we noticed a small peek-a-boo view of the Hollywood sign. There's in room coffee, a vending machine in the \"lobby\" but no ice. If you are a tourist who likes walking (some bus lines nearby and a couple of eateries but more options are available if you walk 1/2 a mile in any direction), or have a car, this might be a good budget option for you. If you are delusional and unrealistic, hoping for a 4 star room, you'll be disappointed. My husband and I have family in Silverlake and we are still trying to find our \"go to\" hotel. I don't think that this will be it but we'll definitely consider returning. PS.

This hotel has bed bugs, and they admitted they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had problems in the past but have always addressed them right away. We moved out of our first room (no bed bugs) due to the noise. The person at the front desk moved us to room 205, and we immediately checked for bed bugs under the sheets. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find any, but we did see that there was a plastic covering around the mattress--evidence that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a bed bug problem in the room before. After our first night in the new room we woke up with a ton of bites. Later that day we were watching a movie on the bedspread and I saw a bed bug crawling on one of us. It was a classic bed bug, gorged in blood. We squished it and immediately showed the person at the front desk. He apologized profusely and instantly refunded our money for the rest of our stay, and we got the heck out of there for another hotel. What I would have written had there been no bed bugs: Before you book your hotel here, you need to have the appropriate expectations of what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting. What you will get is: cheap accomodations akin to a college dorm room or hostel; hairdryer only upon request; shabby bed spread but generally clean sheets that may have a few spots; stained desk chair seat; generally old decor and furnishings; stark white tile bathroom that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little grungy but still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122; no central heat--they have a plug-in heater in every room; nice flat screen TV; internet that can be spotty. If you go in with these expectations, and the fact that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only paying something like $65/night for Los Angeles, then you will be fine. I would recommend requesting a room facing the parking lot, since the windows are extremely thin and if you get a room facing the road you will hear loud traffic all night.

It is within a certain budget, granted, but that's about the only saving grace. The hotel is located in a not-so-nice neighbourhood where the local billboards are in spanish. It is a solid walk to any kind of public transport or decent grocery store. A previous claim mentioned that it was centrall located - it isn't. It's about 40 minutes by foot from Hollywood and Highland (the downtown Hollywood area - Graumann's, Walk of Fame, etc) and the walk is not through the safest neighbourhoods. The room itself is reasonable - not bad for the price we paid - but there were a few concerns when the tv wasn't plugged in and the entire entertainment unit had to be dragged closer to the powerpoint. The enamel is peeling in the bath and the lights each operate by chains dangling from the ceiling - some of which were damaged.

I mean, how good can a $50 a night room in Hollywood be? But after reading all the reviews, I decided to give it a chance and I'm glad I did. Here are my impressions, and responses to some of the negative comments I've read from others: Location- It's very centrally located. If you're a tourist, you're only a few minutes from lots of main attractions. To those who complained because they didn't have a rental car...are you crazy? It's LA for heaven's sake, you're GOING to need a car! I rented one for 5 days for $108, and that was at an expensive airport location. Use a little of the TONS of money you're saving by staying here and rent a car! As for neighborhood safety, I am a female traveling alone and I felt very safe. You just have to use common sense like in any big city. Restaurants- To those who said there's nowhere close to eat, I just don't get it. In addition to the Italian place already mentioned, there are 2 excellent Mexican restaurants within 2 blocks. And if you have a car, there are literally dozens of restaurants within a 3 minute drive. Be adventurous, people! Building- VERY cool, especially from the outside as you can see. All the old Hollywood pics are fun. The view of the Hollywood sign is great. As others have said, there is no elevator. I could care less, personally. I stayed on the top (3rd) floor and welcomed the run up the stairs after dinner! It's not luxurious, but still nice and not run-down feeling. Amenities- Free parking! If you've spent any time in LA you know this is HUGE! And free wi-fi! Mine worked perfectly in room 315, not sure why others had problems. There are fridges in the rooms, another great perk. No restaurant or room service. No ice machines, just snack and drink machine in lobby. Basic cable. Rooms- Somewhat sparse but quite comfortable, medium-sized room. The bedspreads and curtains were a little threadbare, as others have noted, and the sheets and towles were not the highest quality, but they were snowy white and spotlessly clean. I received clean towels and linens each day. I slept well on my bed. No outlet in the bathroom, but it was not a problem for me. I always had a place to plug in my laptop and phone charger, too. The only furniture was bed, nightstand, desk w/chair, and TV cabinet/dresser combo. Fine for just one but might need more seating for 2. Large closet with hangers. WIndow A/C, portable heater (I didn't need either). I was on the street side of building and loved it for the view of the hills, H'wood sign, and street action, but if traffic noise bothers you get one in back for sure. Bathroom had good water pressure and was very clean. Staff- I had limited interaction but they seemed very friendly and helpful. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for bargain shoppers, adventurers, and city-lovers. It's not for the lazy, disabled (lack of elevator), unimaginative or spoiled.

The room itself was perfect, nice king sized bed, clean, good sized bathroom and cable tv and for the price i thought it was amazing value! I understand why some people complain about the no elevator issue but for the price i dont see how they can complain, i myself had to carry to 2 big suitcases up to the 3rd floor on my own and it wasnt easy but i for everything else the hotel offered i overlooked it! The free wifi was a nice touch too, sadly for me my laptop had problems connecting to it but lookily the manager of the hotel allowed me to use his laptop whenever i needed to check up on emails and such like which i felt was a really nice touch! The location in Melrose is ideal if you have a car to travel about in, sadly i didnt but as i dont mind walking the 45 minute walk to hollywood boulevard was pleasent enough, Also Paramount pictures in literally 2 minutes walk from the hotel and my favourite place i found was Larchmont village was again only a 20 minute walk away!

Lots of history. I love old buildings and thought this might be interesting. When we got inside to check in the fellow behind the desk was not really friendly. Just gave us our key and away we went up the STAIRS. 3 story building but I was lucky my husband could carry the bags to the room on the first floor. There was a very old elevator from years ago that is not used now. Once in the room at first glance it looks OK. We had a king bed. It was fairly comfortable. The closet was only about 1 foot wide but was enough for hanging clothes. It could not hold the luggage. There was a fridge and portable heater if it got cold. The curtains and bedspread are old so we took the bedspread off the bed and put it in the drawer. The skirt around the bottom of the bed was ripped and needed to be thrown out. The towles in the bathroom were old and small. They did supply the regular shampoo and soap. The tub was the original and had been resurfaced. The water pressure in the shower was fine. Very small bathroom but it worked. There was no electrical outlet in it. Back into the main part of the room I think there was only 2 electrical outlets total. One had a power cord and had the fridge and other things plugged into it. We plugged our laptop into it but had to be careful not to trip over the cord. The table you are suppose to put the laptop on was on the other side of the room and the cord did not reach. Actually the table was so close to the bed you could not put a chair at the table anyway. Oh yeah, did I mention there was not a chair anyway. There is no phone in the room. The only place to sit was on the bed. We used the place just to sleep anyway. We would walk up Melrose to Western and go right to Hollywood in about 15 minutes. The area is very seedy but Very convenient. Since we found there were really no decent places to eat near the hotel we ate before returning to the hotel. It is not a place I would like to have a toddler crawling around on the carpets.

I was at the back on the car park side (room next to the stairs on the first floor) but it was very quiet at night and I got a great nights sleep.

The hotel is well services with public transport, the number 10 bus stops a few yards from the front door. The Metro is a short bus ride away. Bus fares for seniors are 25c, the Metro $1.50. Our large room was well equiped with the usual coffee making, fridge and wide screen TV &. A/C..Although they don't have a restaurant/coffee bar, there is a little supply shop a few yards away. Also there is a very good Italian restaurant nextdoor but one. The room was spotlessly clean with a very comfortable large double bed. The only thing on the down side is the lack of an elevator to the first and second floors. As all the rooms are on the first & second floors this would present a problem for anyone with a walking disability.We are both in our 70's and had no problem with the stairs. Edward, who runs the hotel is very helpful and obliging Try and get a room at the back of the building, I think the front room could be noisy from the traffic. . .", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cCan't beat the price!\u201d", "Author": "abysse", "ReviewID": "UR78535626", "Content": "We didn't know a lot about that hotel before making our reservation but were really pleased.

From what I understand, this hotel was recently remodeled by new owners, and they did a great job of turning this old place into a truly historic hotel that I'd love to stay at again. Pros: Clean and nicely decorated with old movie star photographs down every hall. Wonderful service. Everyone at this hotel is helpful and courteous. Good room for the price. A little small, but it's more cozy than anything else. Nice TV and a fridge. Free parking and they have a guard outside at night to protect your car. Gas station right across the street (fairly cheap too). Cons: West Hollywood is a little sketchy place, but I felt very safe at the HHH and had no serious problems or concerns. It is an older hotel, so you probably won't want to stay hear if you don't like that sort of quaint charm. Walls are somewhat thin. Plumbing can be loud, especially from the rooms above you.
