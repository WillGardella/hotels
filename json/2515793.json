This consisted of a large room with a king bed and a separate kitchen / living room with a sofa bed for my adult daughter. It was well designed with doors into the bathroom area from both sides of the apartment. The room was clean and comfortable and suited us fine. We didn't have a car during our stay and Cedric, one of the reception people, was more than helpful in advising us of the bus system and calling cabs. The breakfast were reasonably good if a little monotonous and generally we though we'd found a little gem and then it all went pear shaped. On returning to our room one night we saw the largest cockroach I have ever seen walking across the wall of the living room, despite chasing the little bugger with a cup, it flew somewhere never to be seen again. As a result my daughter had to make the ultimate sacrifice, yes she moved her mattress into our room and slept on the floor with the interconnecting doors sealed with towels. During the night I found another smaller roach in the bathroom which I managed to trap. In the morning Cedric arranged for us to change rooms so they could deal with the 'critter' problem. This room was the same layout as the first room but the mattress on the sofa bed comprised of the springs a very thin covering of fabric. We did ask if it could be changed but that never happened. After two days my daughter gave up trying to sleep on it and just slept on the sofa. I would have given it 5 stars for the first 7 nights then 1 or 2 for the remaining nights. Cedric is brilliant though. Hotel could do with room safes although there are small boxes behind reception.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "crewe", "Title": "\u201cExcellent, clean,comfortable and friendly hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "satchmo999", "ReviewID": "UR128041595", "Content": "The recepion staff are very friendly and informative - the best out of the 4 or so hotels we've stayed at in Orlando.

Also had adjoining room for our 14 year old son with double sofa bed, big TV, lazyboy recling chair, table+chairs. He was made up with having his own \"bedsit\" as his rom aslo contained a kitchenette with large fridge, dishwasher, hotplate, toaster, cupbaords, pots and pans etc. Bathroom had a good shower and bath. Everything was very clean and in good order. We only used the pool once, but it was fine. The one time we mamanged to make it out of the parks for a reasonable time we made it for \"Happy hour\" in the dining area where each guest can get a coupld of drinks free (2 x draft bud lites - very nice !!). The location of this hotel is in Palm parkway which is 10 minutes drive to downtime disney. Also by driving north on Parm parkway/Turkey lake road you can be in Seaworld in about 15 ms, universal about 20 mins. There are lots of eateries nearby - would recommend the Golden Coral which is on Vineland - about 5/10 mins away. Also a large Walmart on Turkey lake road is convienient (10 minutes drive).

We stayed on the 4th floor. The bedroom was light and airy and there was a separate living area with kitchenette and a large sofa bed and a large bathroom which had 2 doors this became a little annoying as you had to remember to lock both doors, in the end we kept the bedroom one locked and blocked it with a suitcase. The 2 double beds were the comfiest we had ever slept in, in a hotel. The rooms were cleaned every day and the beds changed every couple of days. The breakfast was served everyday until 9.30 and was a hit with the kids something different every day. Monday though Thursday at 5.30pm - 7.30pm you were able to have 2 complementary drinks (wine/beer adults soft drinks for kids) and some sort of snack, this was very enjoyable to have round the pool. Now the pool, its not the biggest or the smallest you might see, but it is adequate. There are plenty of sun loungers around to soak up the Florida sun then a quick dunk in the pool to cool you off as well as a jacuzzi . The kids played endlessly in the pool with different balls and floats that people leave behind after their holiday. We didn't hire a car on this occasion due to the location of the hotel, it is smack right in the middle between Disney and Universal. The hotel provide a shuttle to Disney around 3 times a day which is free. But, they charge $10pp to go to Universal, the water parks and Sea world and only run once a day, there were 6 of us which would have made it very expensive, the local taxi cost around $20 return from Sea world and $30-35 for Universal which was great value and we were not restricted by time,top-tip, get the number of your taxi driver and use them for the duration of your holiday we did and he was always available when we text him a time to pick up or collect well done JOSEPH. As I said the hotel was in a great location very safe to walk around in the evening there are plenty of restaurants inc TGI'S, Angus steakhouse, Pizza hut, Denny's etc a Pharmacist, supermarkets and gift shops in about 10min and in around 20 mins you can walk to Down Town Disney. The hotel is perfect for families the staff are some of the friendliest I have ever met, nothing is too much trouble and will assist you at all times with regards to anything! Also there is free wifi with the grounds so no hefty phone bills to come home too. The only thing that niggled me was that there was no bar in the hotel or on site restaurant. Saying that I would certainly use this hotel again. Well done guys this hotel certainly made our holiday :) The location is superb right in-between the Disney Parks and Universal studios.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cOne essential extra would make this an even better hotel\u201d", "Author": "Robocop1", "ReviewID": "UR127919812", "Content": "This is a really great little hotel to use as a base for visting the surrounding attractions especially Disney as it offers a complimentary bus shuttle to Epcot where you can get transport to all the other parks. Our room was really more of an apartment with a separate bedroom containing two huge beds and a TV. There is also a separate bathroom with WC and a large washroom. On entering the apartment there is a kitchen with a big fridge/freezer, microwave, hob, dishwasher, table and 4 chairs.. This leads onto a lounge area with sofa's and another big TV. My one grievance is that there is no safe in the room to keep valubales. Instead there are some small safe boxes in reception but not enough for one per room and as the hotel was busy we consequently were unable to get one and had to carry my valuables around with us for the duration which was just as well as on one day we found our door had not been closed properly after it had been cleaned and anyone could have just walked in - luckily no one did. This may have been speciific to our room only but the air conditoning was incredibly nosiy when it kicked in and although we could have turned it off the room would have been uncomfortably hot at night. Breakfasts are good and change on a daily basis with 3 cooked items each morning supplemented by toast, bagels, doughnuts, cereals, fruit and yoghurt. Another little perk was the early evening Monday hotdog and alcoholic drink ( beer or wine) which were compliments of the manager to all guests. Really nice to come back to after a day at the theme parks. As has already been mentioned the pool is small and it's not really the sort of hotel I would stay in purely to sit by the pool all day. Loads of nearby diners & restaurants that are only a 5-10 minute walk away - all with good menus. The decor was a little dated but most importantly it was clean hotel.

Firstly, the location is great for all the parks, local amenities and shops. You can walk to the shops by cutting though a few buildings across the road which is really handy. We didn't go to all the parks but for the ones we did visit we hired a car or got a cab and it was literally 5/10 minutes to each park and about ten dollars in a cab. The hotel itself was clean and tidy and the rooms were great. our room had two double beds, a living room with a second tv (which was great when i kept waking up in the middle of the night because of jet lag) And a really ample kitchen with everything you need to do a bit of self catering should you wish to.....we didn't because there's probably a different resturant in the area to have breakfast, lunch and dinner a different place every day of the year! the pool area was ok. The pool was quite small and often over crowded which meant we never seemed to get a chance for a proper swim, but that's ok, we did appreciate that it was very much a child friendly hotel but it was a shame that there was no pool side bar for drinks and snacks as we enjoy that kind of thing on a holiday and it's nice to sit by the pool with a drink in the early evenings when it's still warm. Having said this, the pool was a lovely temperature and always spotlessly clean. The breakfasts were good, and for a complimentry meal at the start of the day you can't really complain. It'd have been pefect if they'd had more options of 'cold' choices like more cereals or fruits but what they did offer in the way of omelettes and bacon etc was ample. The staff in the hotel were great and a particular mention goes to Milton on reception and Joey who does the bar in the evenings. both of these guys were so helpful and friendly, advising us on the local area and where to eat. it's nice that they remember names/faces in such a busy hotel and place. Someone on here has said there is only one lift. nope, there is two. the first one is near reception and the other is at the end of the corridor - the later lift always arrives much quicker than the former! one quick tip for the evenings if you fancy a night out - go to Pointe Orlando (between 10 and 20 dollars in a taxi or about a half hour walk) It's a bit more lively and 'happening' with some bars and what not. we went there twice and enjoyed drinks and dinner in a few places and had a great time. another few tips for dinner - Chillis, Don Pablos, Perkins, Charlie's steak house (get your name on the wall if you can manage the 50 ounce steak but the prices might make you squirm!). we also swam with dolphins during our stay and i recommend this to everyone - absolutely incredible, but i'll leave that for another review. This was my first time in the USA and thanks to all the friendly staff not only in the hotel but the local area I now have the bug to visit more of the USA and can't wait to get cracking on our next trip to the states. Absolutely fantastic country and i now see why everyone raves about you guys!

We wernt disappointed! Hired a car booked it online easy. We found hotel straight away asked couple people on route. Location was spot on 5 mins drive to disney, 15 mins to universal, 5 mins walk to loads restaurants. Would recommend Hooters, gud for a burger, Black Angus steak and Shrimps were marvelous, Olive Garden italian and v. gud and across crossroads The Ale House the cheapest but definately worth a mention. Couple times we got taxis (8 people) so we could have a beer 30 dollars to Universal City Walk or 3 buses!!! Downtown Disney and Pleasure Island was 16 dollars, kids loved Disney Quest which were included on tickets we had bought online otherwise $40ish. Winn Dixie supermarket around the corner for supplies locals really friendly everytime we went we were offered someones saver card brill! Staff at hotel were great couple times wen we had a few busy days at parks came back to hotel had a soak in hot tub couple cold beers, Cedric on the desk had papa johns pizza ( never had a bad order always piping hot) on speed dial - great end to fabulous day. Edwardo was great with the kids at breakfast time kept them entertained - food was better than expected couple hot items fruit, cereals, toast and jams, juice, tea and coffee. Rooms i would say are bit dated but never the less gud value perhaps cud do with being bit bigger ( there was 5 of us and the sofa bed was not mega comfy) kitchen was more that adequate cud have cooked if we d have wanted. Maid service was great washed our cups etc clean towels everyday. Mon-thurs couple free beers and pop, crisps incl in price, managers special on wed wen you could have burger 1 week and hotdog other. Pool is fairly small but we always got a bed, hot tub, basket ball area, even got bbqs that you could use. Free towels. You couldnt ask for anything more other than perhaps foot massage! Few tips: 2 toll roads from international airport $1.75 for both make sure you get in right queue if you havent change a fine if not. We took a picnic to parks including couple frozen waters not a problem saved us loads(we ate out every evening) although food looked really nice and not a bad price. Refillable cups available which wer gud value. We took dollars with us and credit card in case we ran out which we didnt but you do need it for car and hotel, we roughly spent around $100-$150 for 5 of us on evening meal incl drinks sometimes bottle wine. Never saw a exchange shop. We ordered our tickets for parks online with ' i love orlando' \u00a31600 for disney and universal and from what others said ours wer cheapest included fastpass in disney. Try to plan what rides you want to go on you can only have fastpass tickets on so many rides and every so often throughout day and queues can be long!! Wear comfy shoes!!!

Stayed here end of March beginning of April 2012 and was our 3rd stay there. Suites are very clean, spacious and equip with everything you will need. The only disappointment is the King suites (one huge bed) are only located near the lifts or end of the corridor next to the air con units so can be slightly noisy, the beds are extra comfy! Safety deposit boxes are located behind reception; you sometimes have to put your name on a list for one if the hotel is busy. One of the reviews on here says there is only one lift but that is not the case there is two, one is located just off reception at the top of the hall way on the left and one is located right at the bottom of the hall way on the left hand side where the ice machines are, we used this one frequently as our room was near it. At breakfast they serve a variety of food on different day which is a bit repetitive but its great for free and to fill up before you head out for the day! The happy hour special on an evening is a nice little touch. Staff are all friendly and helpful. Disappointed that Jason on reception has left but these things happen. The guy who serves the drink at happy hour is lovely and he recognised us which was nice. There are plenty of restaurants within a short walking distance for example Cici's pizza restaurant/take out, steak houses, run and run Chinese take out which do delivery, McDonalds, Burger King, Steak and Shake, TGI Fridays, Buffalo Wild Wings etc and also a large food mart. You can walk to Downtown Disney which takes about 20 minutes. The Links buses run frequently outside of the hotel, all day passes cos $4.50. The hotel offers a shuttle bus service to all parks including Universal, the Disney drop off is at Epcot then you have to use Disney transportation to get to the other parks which is so easy. The only thing we found with the shuttle bus was that its restricting as there is only one from the hotel at either 8.30am or 11am ish and the earliest one back to the hotel is 6pm! I think the hotel should look into putting a more frequent service on!

The outside pool area and hot tub was pleasant. There are landscaped gardens and basketball courts.

Breakfast was free (as was parking) and there was a fairly good variety of hot and cold food. The breakfast area could get crowded but they had an extra 'over flow' room they opened up on some days so there was always enough seating to be found.

The hotel is in a great location, close to Disney, sea world and 15+ restaurants. The olive garden 1/4 mile away is great. But there are plenty. There is a Walmart 7 or 8 mins away in the car also. So location is great. Staff - all of the reception staff are top draw, very good and helpful. Breakfast and maintenance staff too. The rooms are pretty good - kitchen area with coffee machine, microwave and fridge/freezer. 2 tvs and bath/shower. A little dated but nothing major. Clean and decent beds, pillows ok. The pool is ok, it's not massive and not dozens of beds, but we never had a problem getting one. Kids loved the pool, it was very warm. Reception and general areas are pretty good, clean and comfortable. Breakfast is good - it's free, so remember that. If you are from the USA and used to good buffets, it will be of average quality. But they do 3 hot items, various fruit, breads etc. We got a bit bored by the end of day 10, but to be fair it started the day off well. Enough choice and the kids enjoyed it. Also the coffee and tea is available all day, a nice touch. Coffee was half decent. Cereal, toast, bagels etc. They do a managers drinks and snacks evening mon to thurs. Two drinks, wine or beer, plus soft drinks. This was a nice touch and we relaxed by the pool whilst having it. There is free wifi in the room, enough for business use. Not super fast, but not bad.

The room had everything we needed:2 separate rooms for privacy (king suite), small kitchen with all the utilities, Bathroom could be entered from either the living room or bedroom.

Another thing is that the elevator was very slow. Thankfully, we were on the second floor and could take the stairs, but for those who stayed on the higher floors was inconvenience.

We were skeptical about a first floor room but we were in and out so much it became convenient. We had an executive suite that included 2 luxurious queen sized beds and an en suite kitchen . Kitchen had ample materials to cook (heck we made steak twice that week) and 2 burners - even a dishwasher! The living area/kitchen was one area, bathroom another, sink another, and bedroom another. Each of these areas had doors so that they could have been closed off for privacy - loved it! Don't forget a tv in the bed room and another in the living room! The free wifi in the room was very good, fast enough to FaceTime on an iPad/iPhone no lag. If you need Internet at the hotel, you will need to pay, bring your own devices! I can't say much about the shuttle, never took it. One of the Disney world entrances were 5 minutes away via car so we never used it. This hotel is close to outlet shopping - 2 major ones. Have to drive there, looks close on the map but don't be fooled! Vineland and International outlets maybe 15 minutes away tops. There's also plenty of food in the area from sushi to Olive Garden. And we found a Target and Publix where we bought our steaks to cook, very convenient. On the topic of food, the free breakfast at the hotel was great too. They alternated everyday. scrambled eggs, sausage, ham, waffles are just some of your options. The oatmeal was also memorable - creamy and warm. Bananas and some canned fruit are other options. We attended the free reception in the afternoon once - we never made it back in time for the others, too much to do!

It is closed to both Universal, Disney and SeaWorld (within 15 minutes of driving), and there are also many restaurants within walking distance. A Walmart is located approximately 4 miles or 8 minutes north of the hotel (Turkey Lake Road), so you can buy everything you need there. That said, I would definitely recommend anyone going to Orlando to have a rental car, it will make your life much more easier (and it's cheap too). Back to the hotel, it is a five stories building near all attractions, but yet it's in a quiet neighborhood so there is not any issue related to surrounding noise. The room decor is definitely not modern, but they are kept clean and functional. I booked the King Suite and it is large with separate bedroom and a kitchenette. My room has a view to the pool. Although there is only two lifts for the whole hotel, I never need to wait long for the lift to come. Swimming pool and a basketball half-court is free to all guests. Parking, wifi internet, free breakfast are also included in the rate. For the room rate I was offered, this is definitely a great value. The breakfast is nice and include eggs and one hot meat (sausages, bacon, ham, etc) per day. Also has breads, bagels, corn flakes, yoghurt, fruits, etc. Very enough for us to start the day, and I never get bored about it. Remember this is complimentary breakfast, any expectation of lots of choices is simply irrelevant. There are free shuttles to parks but since I have my own rental car I didn't use it. The hotel staffs are all very friendly and helpful. Some little issues, the sounds of water running along the pipe from the next room can be heard so it may cause those light sleeper some problem if your neighbor take a shower in the early morning. Also the cooking utensils are limited and some are heavily stained. But when I ask the housekeeper they promptly get another cleaner one for us.

The price was EXCELLENT and was initially how I found it on the internet. However, the absolute BEST part of staying there was Mary, our housekeeper. Everyday, she made a towel animal for us and incorporated various objects we left in the room - tiaras, stuffed animals, etc. into them! One day it was a Swan; then a Teddy bear, Micky's head, and a sea turtle! We raced into the room after visiting the parks to see what Mary had made for us! We really got a kick out of them!

The location is really good and if you don't have a car you can use the free shuttles from the hotel, they bring you to all the Disney theme parks ( it takes around 30 minutes because the shuttle stops in other hotels to carry more people ) and to Sea World ( that was better because the shuttle was just for us and we reached SeaWorld in about ten minutes without other stops), anyway for us the shuttle were free because we booked through Virgin Holidays but if your agency does not have the free shuttles included you can still use them and pay about 10 dollars per person for a round trip. The staff is nice but nothing special. The room is great, it is a suite so it has all the comforts of home and you can actually cook there so you can save on meals, there is no restaurant on site but you can order food from other restaurants ( we did not do it ) or you can have a walk to some local restaurants, but we did not do it either. There is also a supermarket close to the hotel and some shops that sell Disney merch and other stuff at lowest prices than inside the theme parks. The free breakfast is okay if you are American or British, but we are from Italy and we did not like the items they served so after a couple of mornings we stopped doing breakfast there, anyway they serve coffee, milk, cereals, fruits, and some cooked food. There is a parking outside but we did not have a car so we do not know if it is free or not. The hotel is quiet and you don't hear noises from the cars even if it is quite close to the street, the cleaness is okay, you can buy tickets to some of the major attractions including Disney directly in the hotel. The area is safe and the rooms are quite too, we rarely heard noises from other guests. Overall we liked our stay there, it was also pretty cheap for its location and its quality and we recommend it to people, both families and not, that want to enjoy a Disney holiday in a safe and nice hotel close to all the major theme parks. ps= they also offer a shuttle to Universal and Universal Islands of Adventures that was quite a long trip, almost a hour, because the shuttle drivers stopped to several other hotels to pick up more people so if you want to reach the parks faster you will need to book a private shuttle or a taxi; for all the theme park's shuttle they don't have much choices regarding the time tables, the one that is better connected is DisneyWorld but for instance they drop you off at Epcot and you need to use the monorail too to go to Magic Kingdom or the free Disney bus to Animal Kingdom. For Seaworld and Universal Studios ( both Universal parks) they don't have a night shuttle and can be a pity for Universal if you want to enjoy the CityWalk at night, then you have to book a taxi or a private shuttle to come back at your hotel.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIt was ok but not great\u201d", "Author": "jonesj27562", "ReviewID": "UR124960342", "Content": "This hotel was in a great location and breakfast was good which were 2 of my criteria.

The sofa bed is really only suitable for one person to sleep on, but the other beds are very comfy. Having a kitchen within the room as well is very useful, although we didn't really use ours. We had a large group staying here in several rooms, and all really enjoyed the stay. We went through Virgin who also offered free shuttles to Universal and Disney, which we did use, although you have to let them know if advance of getting on the buses, which are a little old and bumpy!! We didn't have any cars over the week, being a large group, and instead used the number 50 bus outside the hotel, the shuttles and a private transfer company Florida Dolphin Tours which was brilliant. There are also many restaurants within walking distance of the hotel, and we liked Amici Italian and a couple of others about 5mins walk away. It is perfect location, as it isn't as busy as international drive area. The pool and hot tub are also great as well. The breakfast is basic, but if you are happy with toast or cereal and a couple of hot things each day it is perfect, and saves having to go out or pay more for these American hotels.

Last month was our 18th visit. Each and every time we stay here and have a great time! This is a very comfortable hotel, the perfect hotel to stay while in Orlando! This last time we stayed from October 15 to October 30. It literally became our home away from home for these last wonderful 7 years! Let\u00b4s be more specific: 1. The LOCATION is the best you can get. The hotel is located at 8303 Palm Parkway, Lake Buena Vista, a charming and quiet street, less than 2 mins from SR 535 and the Downtown Disney entrance. We have stayed at two Disney hotels before (Coronado Springs/All-Star Movies) and felt kind of in the middle of nowhere. That\u00b4s not the case with Hawthorn. Exiting the hotel make a right towards 535 and you are in the middle of everything: The Crab House, Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Macaroni Grill, Pizza Hut, Burger King, McDonald\u00b4s, Post Office, two Walgreens, Wal-Mart, Orlando Premium Outlets(off 535), Black Angus Steakhouse, Sizzler, Dixie\u00b4s Supermarket (good prices), Gooding\u00b4s Supermarket (expensive), only to name a few (really). Nothing compares to this location; 2. The HOTEL is lovely! It\u00b4s relatively new and looks like it. As you walk into the hotel you\u00b4ll be greeted by a beautiful lobby. To your right is the front desk and the staff is always helpful and friendly. To your left is the dining area where breakfast is served everyday. It\u00b4s a hot breakfast and a pretty good one and...free. I think it\u00b4s ridiculous to give this hotel a not so good review based on its breakfast. The great majority of the Orlando hotels don\u00b4t even have any breakfast at all. So, I think that having scrambled eggs, bacon, harsh brown, pancakes,cereals, milk, hot beverages, juices, bread with toasters, bagels, muffins, donuts, jam, cream cheese and fruits is a nice way to begin your day and plus you get to avoid the hassle of having breakfast at the parks. To your right are the corridors with plush carpeting and soft lighting leading to the rooms and the elevators (big and nice looking too); 3. The ROOM is just as lovely as you see at their site. Big, beautifully decorated and cozy! Ah, and no funny smell too. We usually stay in a Queen Suite away from the pool (can get noisy!) \u2013 even-numbered rooms. First of all, there\u00b4s a full kitchen and I mean full. There\u00b4s a big refrigerator with ice-maker, dishwasher, microwave, toaster, coffee maker, two burner stove top, and all the utensils you need. The dining area adjacent to the kitchen is charming with a wooden table and 4 chairs and a chandelier providing plenty of light when you eat or use your computer. By the way they provide free wi-fi access and a very fast one too. And then there\u00b4s the sitting room with a comfortable sofa, a couch and a TV with remote. The room was a really big one, with two queen beds, a dresser with 4 drawers, a big closet with lots of hangers and a rack for your luggage, ironing board and iron, alarm clock, another TV and plenty of room for our 4 gigantic bags (I love shopping!) . The bathroom is pretty much standard, with a tub and a shower (a good one and yes, as other members stated they are a bit noisy ) and a big sink outside with all those nice toiletries; 4. The HOUSEKEEPING is terrific! Not too much of an intruder but always making sure the room is clean. Everyday when we came back to our room everything was looking good, the bed was made, the dishes had been washed, we had new towels, new tissue box or whatever was missing before but our stuff was untouched. Some days we returned to our room to find some cute towel animal waiting for us on our beds! Cute! This last stay our fire alarm went off while we were sleeping but maintenace took care of it beautifully! 5. The STAFF: This hotel has a very friendly staff from manager (Rafael) to housekeeping. But there are some staff members that deserve higher praise: Bernard (front desk), Cedric (front desk), Aracelli (housekeeping) and Alfredo (maintenance). They make a difference! Spending our hard earned vacation in Orlando is our definition of heaven but staying at the Hawthorn Suites Lake Buena Vista upgraded our expectations even more. Now we are officially spoiled!

Housekeeping was spot on, breakfast was good, they had water, orange juice, coffee, tea etc then two types of cereal and milk, 3 types of bread with toasters, bagels, yoghurt, then there was different hot items each day... sausage, scrambled egg and crispy bacon etc. Best thing is you can have as much as you like!

So, things didn't start out very well. My husband called the front desk right away and was told that no king size bed rooms were available. They agreed to adjust the rate and we agreed to stay. The room was huge, larger than some apartments. Probably a good choice for large families and why there were so many of them. Lots of children running up and down the halls. The room was clean. Breakfast was very basic and crowded, so we skipped it a couple of times. During the week...Mon-Thurs, there is a evening reception with 2 free drinks (beer or wine). Nice touch. Unfortunately, they serve the beer in styrofoam (sp?) cups! Yuck! I brought a glass down from the suite the next 2 nights. We did not use the Disney transportation from the hotel. Since we know our way around all the Disney properties, we decided to walk to Downtown Disney and get Disney transportation from there. It was an enjoyable walk of about 35 minutes. The biggest problem we had at this hotel was noise. On the first evening, we received a call from the front desk to ask if everything was ok.....at 10:00 pm! We were both sound asleep. As other people have mentioned, we knew when our neighbors were taking a shower. This wasn't really a problem until the last night (a Friday). People were showering all night long. No kidding!

Plenty of car-parking, the hotel is clean and the beds very comfortable.

The pool was a bit small and my husband thought it would be a great idea to remove the basketball area to make way for a larger pool area. The breakfast was adequate, nothing special but enough and better than looking for somewhere to eat on your way to a park. There are plenty of places to eat nearby, some within walking distance. We particularly liked Olive Garden. Sweet Tomatoes is a great healthy choice at Crossroads at LBV but beware if you wish to walk of drivers turning right at red lights despite the pedestrian crossing indicating you can cross the road.

Sure, grits aren't to everyone's taste, but there were sausage muffins, eggs, fresh fruit, pastries, juice & coffee available. We didn't eat every morning, but when we did it was pretty good. The pool area was a little on the small side, however we had no problem at any time getting a sun bed, and the pool was clean, and big enough to have relaxing swim at the end of a busy day.

Disney shuttles Only take you to epcot with departures at 8am 10am and 12:45pm and only pick you up at 6pm 8pm and 10:30 pm. The later pick up time also fills up quickly and you could be stuck leaving the parks at 6pm or having no transportation home. Keep in mind most firework shows start at 10 pm so if you wanted to see the wishes fireworks at magic kingdom you cant because you need to take the monorail back to epcot to catch your hotel shuttle which means your leaving the park at 9:45 ish. Shuttles are sometimes up to 15 minutes late and they expect gratuity. If you stay at a Disney resort in the downtown Disney area, complimentary Disney busses depart every 20 minutes all day until 2am and I would recommend this for anyone coming to Orlando for Disney. A perfect example of why: yesterday it poured rain all day and we could only leave the park at 10:30 pm. Unless we wanted to spend $50 on a cab back to the hotel.

Let me first start with the positives. The hotel is very easy to reach from Disney World, especially Downtown Disney. The hotel lobby is simple, but inviting and clean, as is the rest of the hotel. And, that about ends the positives. The rooms are quite small and cramped. For an area rich in hotel rooms, you can easily find a more comfortable room for less money. In addition, in the bathroom, the sink has no space to place any items on, which is quite annoying. The biggest issue we ran into though was with the service. When we went to use the toilet, we discovered that it was clogged and needed to be fixed. I tried calling down to the Front Desk, but there was no answer after several rings. I went straight down there instead and asked that someone come and fix the toilet, but they said that maintenance and housekeeping weren't on duty for another few hours so no one could fix it. Plenty of staff were at the hotel, so someone should have come and taken care of this. The most they offered me was a plunger to fix it myself. This was a completely unacceptable answer for a hotel to give. In the hospitality industry, asking a guest to plunge a toilet is a big problem with your service. The front desk refused to do anything about this. As we were checking out in about an hour at this point, there wasn't too much recourse for us except contacting Wyndham directly. After I contacted Wyndham via their website, they did get back to me about a week later with an offer of a $75 refund to be delivered to me, which was received after about another week. I'm glad that Wyndham did provide this compensation, but they didn't address the need to re-train their front desk staff on how to deal with these situations. In addition to this major issue, they also did manage to \"lose\" our reservation and we had to jump through a few hoops to get them to find it.

A kitchen with dining table and bathroom with separate dressing room. TV in both rooms. Not modern but very clean and comfortable. Rooms cleaned to high standard every day by lovely friendly staff. FREE FOOD - Breakfast was enough to keep us all going till lunch time. Every day saw porridge, two cereals, various breads to toast, yogurt and fruit, plus changing hot food every day with two or three of scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, French toast, pancakes, waffles. Every evening some kind of snack which the kids loved to have like pretzels or crisps. One evening a week burger and hot dogs. Very basic but free and a welcome touch. STAFF - This made the hotel for us. Greeted on arrival by Jason who knew our name before we even spoke to him. What a friendly and helpful guy! Eliana on Front desk was the sweetest of people who we all adored and will miss very much. Could not do enough for us. We felt like we were guests in their own home, that was how well they treated us. Every other member of staff we met from the lovely Spanish speaking guy in the restaurant who played with our kids, to the cleaners, other front desk and even the taxi drivers called in for us were so friendly. LOCATION - Very central to both the Disney parks and Sea World. About $15 in a taxi to Epcot or $25 to Magic Kingdom. Although if you are intending to come back to the hotel during the day or go out again in the evenings a car would be preferable. We paid just \u00a3200 all in to rent a car for a week. The bus laid on by the hotel is awful and to be honest not roadworthy in my opinion. I was told that this bus would soon be replaced. It also stops at other hotels on the way to Epcot so can take 30 mins instead of 10 by taxi or car. POOL - lovely and clean just right for a dip in the afternoon after a busy hot day at the parks.

Sometimes coffee wasn't hot as I would have liked. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful. Housekeeping staff were quick and very thorough to keep everything fresh & clean.

Our suite was as expected - well, we have stayed before! The bedroom is huge with 2 queen-size beds which are one of the most comfortable we have slept in and the pillows are firm which suit us perfectly. The bathroom area is split with sink in one room and adjacent is small room with bath,overbath shower and toilet. The lounge area is spacious with a small kitchen area attached and dining table. The kitchen is well stocked with cutlery, crockery/cooking utensils, pots and pans. There is a hob, microwave, dishwasher, full size fridge and coffee maker - coffee is replenished every day. The suites are a perfect 'home from home' - great if you've got children like us, they can settle for bed and you can relax in the lounge. The hotel have brought in a new 'green' policy whereby you must remember to hang 'clean my room' sign on door before going out for the day - on several occasions we returned to very messy beds and tip still on the bed - oops!! The hotel has a lot to offer - free breakfast, which is changeable each day but generally offers cereal, fruit juice, yoghurt, fruit, bread for toasting, porridge and usually 2-3 hot choices - sausages, bacon, egg, hash brown (although not often enough - delicious!!). In the evening Monday - Thursday was the 'social hour' which lasted between 5.30 and 7.30pm - sadly this has been limited to only 2 alcoholic drinks each (wine or beer) and seems to have put a lot a fellow travellers off from coming back to the hotel for a chill-out. Last year, through the social, we met loads of fantastic people but this time, new friends were thin on the ground. There is also free wi-fi available and free shuttle bus to Disney - time are a bit limited though - but the Lynx 50 bus runs regularly outside the hotel, running to Seaworld and Disney.

We liked this place a lot.\u201d", "Author": "samies-mom", "ReviewID": "UR108934847", "Content": "Checked in on May 15, 2011 for five nights. Check in was exceptionally easy - took less than 5 minutes (we arrived around 3 p.m.). The lobby is large and very attractively appointed with large comfy furniture in pleasing colors. The room does have good space. We utilized the \"kitchen\" table every day. The full fridge is really helpful for milk for our 4 year old, sodas for ourselves, and left overs from the local restaurants for all of us. The bedroom is large. The mattresses are comfortable, and have passed the \"bedbug test\" (not only visual inspection, but a five night stay with no tell-tale bites). The bathroom area is clean, if a little \"old\". It's helpful that the vanity area is surrounded by doors - one leading to the bedroom, and one leading to the kitchen/dining/living area. It makes for a handy \"dressing area\". Essentially, one could take a shower and step out of the shower area and get ready in complete privacy in the vanity area while the rest of the family could either be watching TV or getting ready in the bedroom, also in privacy. The air conditioning seemed to work very well and was quiet in our room. The rugs are very dirty - bring slippers or flip flops to combat that problem. I suspect the rugs need a good steam cleaning (at least in our room), but that really would be our only complaint about the room. The pool is a completely decent size and was very quiet during our stay. The hot tub is also decently sized and adequate. The hotel provides towels outside and in a plentiful amount. There are little lizards (gekkos?) everywhere in the pool area! You really do have to be careful not to step on them. They are very small, non-aggressive, and don't seem to want to interact with the humans and we saw them nowhere other than by the pool, so there was absolutely no \"ick\" factor surrounding these little guys. I suspect they could be helpful in \"bug\" control, of which we saw none, other than just standard dragonflies, etc. The outside area has 2 gas grills, but I never saw anyone using them, so I do not know how they work, but they seem clean and the area around them is clean. There is also a half basketball court. The housekeeping staff does a good job of keeping the rooms and common areas clean. The hotel also has a \"green\" policy of not changing out all bed linens, etc. every day unless you want them to. It's nice to know that the hotel does have a conservation policy in effect. The complimentary breakfast is varied and good. Hot items during our stay included scrambled eggs, pancakes, corned beef hash, hashbrowns, etc. They also provide bagels and/or english muffins and bread for toasting. They have 2 cereals, three different types of milk (whole, skim, and 2 percent), apple, fruit punch and orange juice, as well as mixed fruits and oatmeal. Certainly a plentiful supply of food, especially at the cost of FREE. But listen to the warnings about it being over at 9:30 (or 10 on the weekends) - at 9:35 a.m., you'd never know there was any food in the place just five minutes earlier. Monday through Thursday there is also free beer, wine, soda, and chips and salsa from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. The wine is cheap, the beer is warm, but hey - it's free, and the service is always very friendly. There is also complimentary coffee and tea available all day. 10 minute walk away is a 7-11, Olive Garden, local Lebanese restaurant, and many other restaurants. This particular hotel happens to be very close to a very \"active\" area. There is a bus line that stops on the street where this hotel is located that goes directly to either \"Walt Disney World\" or \"The Magic Kingdom\" (as indicated by the signs on the bus). The hotel provides 3 complimentary morning shuttles to WDW, and 3 returning in the evening. We had a car with us, so we did not utilize the city bus service or the hotel shuttles ourselves. The entrance to Downtown Disney is not a comfortable walking distance away, but is about a 5 or 6 minute drive away.

Hotel is very clean, rooms are spacious, beds are super comfy, nice large bathroom and full kitchen (no kettle though?!). Location is very nice, quiet and surrounded by lakes and greenary. Lots of places to eat within the walking distance and a couple of small supermarkets (7 Elevan for example). Bus No 50 serving Lake Buena Vista stops right outside the hotel which was very convenient as we did not have a car. The bus takes you right to Sea World (5 min journey) and Disney (15 min) Hotel provides complimentary suttle, but only to Disney. For Universal you have to pay 10 USD per person incl children. All other Hawthorn hotels in Orlando provide free transportation to ALL the parks including Sea World. We were slightly dissappointed as I would think the policy should be the same for all hotels under one company. Oh well... Staff at the reception are very friendly and helpful. We had to move rooms as our first one was right next to mechanical room and it was very noisy with the lift going up and down all the time. We were moved no problem the same day we asked and our second room was super quiet facing the parking lot. Swimming pool is rather small for the size of the hotel and can be overcrowded in the evenings however we still enjoyed cooling down in the pool after spending all days long in the heat! Some complimentary services Hawthorn provides add a nice touch to your stay: free wireless internet, complimentary drinks in the evening (between 5 and 7 p.m.), free local calls. We would certainly return to Hawthorn as overall we had a fantastic time and small downsides like no transport and small pool certainly did not matter much to us.

I began doing my hotel and search, quickly found the Hawthorn, and...So many five star reviews?? Could this be possible?? After staying for a solid week, Hawthorn Suites is indeed a five star hotel, so long as these are the categories you're looking to meet: 1) Literally 5 minutes from the entrance to Disney property - you basically drive down the street, take a left, and you're at the big gate. 2) Unbelievably cheap prices - in our case, less than $100 a night for a suite with king sized bed, pull out couch in the main area, and kitchen with stove, microwave, and fridge. Of course, you can't expect much by way of frills - a subpar continental breakfast, a fuzzy TV - but I'm not gonna be the guy who complains that the eggs at his under $100 hotel were soggy. 3) Our room wasn't huge, but the beds were comfortable, plenty of space for four people, we heard nothing from our neighbors, and it served the purpose we were hoping for - a place to sleep - several grades above the squalor of an Econolodge. 4) Service was very helpful, and we even added on a few nights without any trouble. 5) Pool and hot tub outside - not sure when the world universally decided hotel pools should close at 10, but otherwise nice. This is a wonderful place for families and groups making the Disney pilgrimage to stay at - extremely close to the park, very good prices, clearly family oriented, and reliable and clean. Only complaint: the continental breakfast goes until 9:30, at which point they promptly pull everything away. Don't get me wrong, I'm not expecting them to keep making eggs and bacon, but is it really that difficult to leave the cereal out for a little longer?? Not a big deal, we just bought cereal and milk for the room. Now, if I wasn't going to Disney, or looking to feel like I was getting away from the whole Disney/family vacation thing at the end of the day, I probably wouldn't stay here.

Location: Hawthorn is very well located if you have a car. Free parking. If you don\u00b4t mind walking like 10 or 15 minutes you have all kinds of restaurant nearby and some minimarkets/gifts shop. If you don\u00b4t mind a 20-30 minutes walk you may go to a supermarket or to Walgreen. In a stretch you can go as far as Downtown Disney. And that\u00b4s it. For anything else you need transportation. Don\u00b4t even try walking to Premium Outlet (which is fabulous, everyone must go) like I did, unless you have an extra hour and really enjoy walking. The hotel: It\u00b4s spacious, confortable and clean. The d\u00e9cor didn\u00b4t bother me. The staff was nice, like American people in general (I just came from England and the difference in the way the tourist is treated is shocking). The concierge offers car rental and tickets to all the parks, at least most of them, at reasonable prices. There is no restaurant inside the hotel, but like a said there\u00b4s all kinds of foods in a walking distance. Certain days Hawthorn offers some kind of happy hour. A nice touch. Swimming pool is small but popular between the guests. There\u00b4s also a hot tub, half basketball court and a fitness room. Can\u00b4t comment on either. The room: I was upgraded to the suite so I had a living room, a kitchen, a bedroom and bathroom all by myself. The bed was huge and wonderful, the curtains darkened the room enough, the AC was good, the range of channels was great, so were the kitchen\u00b4s facilities. The bathroom, though, could be better. It\u00b4s not just that I hate shower curtain, but the shower itself was not good. Also, one can listen when other guest take a bath. A suggestion: take your own shower cap, shampoo and conditioner. Though the rooms lacked a safe, they have free internet, which was great. Breakfast: I really don\u00b4t understand what the complaint is all about. The breakfast is perfectly fine. It\u00b4s not wonderful, but if you are staying at Hawthorn you are not paying for wonderful breakfast, so enjoy what is offered, which is not bad, I repeat. Transportation: If possible, rent a car. But if you, like me, are afraid of driving in a different country, there are alternatives. - Airport: Hawthorn does not offer transportation to the airport, which is far away, like everything else in Orlando. I was by myself, so the best choice was taking a Mears Shuttle. I believe I paid 33 dollars for a round trip. I can\u00b4t say for sure, but I think if you are in a party of four or more, it may be cheaper to take a cab. Unless you are very cheap, travelling on a budget, adventurous and the luggage is not heavy, don\u00b4t take Lynx buses. They take FOREVER to get anywhere. - Disney parks: They are not far away. Parking a car can be a little expensive (15 dollars a day, something like that) but you are free to leave and return, which may be a good idea depending on the weather. Hotel bus is old but it\u00b4s on time. Three convenient times in the morning, three not so convenient times in the evening. One must pre-book the return bus, but I was by myself and had no trouble changing my mind during the day. Large parties may not be so easy to accommodate. After the bus picks the guests at Hawthorn it takes no more than 15 minutes to reach Epcot. The problem is inside Disney. You have to take the monorail, ferryboat (MK) or buses (Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom) to get to other parks. It can be a drag but there\u00b4s nothing you can do about it. Lynx bus is an option if you need to go to the parks in the afternoon, if you want to leave early or if you want to go do Downtown Disney. - Universal parks: Free transportation if you are travelling by Virgin, 10 dollars to the rest of us. The problem is it\u00b4s the same Disney bus, so one must go first to Disney and then to Universal. By the time you get there, Harry Potter\u00b4s theme island will be crowded. Also, if you are visiting a park a day, you certainly will finish it long before the pick-up time. No idea about Lynx buses. Best choice: Mears Shuttle (17 dollars round trip, if I remember correctly). - Outlets: Despite the proximity of Premium Outlet, one must go by cab. There\u00b4s an outlet that offers free shuttle in the mornings. It\u00b4s not as good as Premium, but it\u00b4s good enough. I recommend it. Other shopping areas (Mall of the Millenia, Florida Mall, Prime Outlet) are far far away. Don\u00b4t take Lynx buses. It took me 1h30 to Florida Mall. - Cabs: very expensive because everything is so distant. Everything considered Hawthorn is an excellent option and I would recommend it. Only one thing though. The day I left Orlando my wallet disappeared either at the hotel or at the shuttle. I have my suspicions but can\u00b4t swear on it. I just thought I should mention to explain why I\u00b4m giving Hawthorn only two stars.", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Battle Ground, Washington", "Title": "\u201cAmazing staff!\u201d", "Author": "bgtwins4me", "ReviewID": "UR98036757", "Content": "My 8 year old twins, my sister, and I were fortunate to stay at the Hawthorne Suites on our recent trip to Orlando.

Prior to booking this trip we went to the web site for this Hawthorn suites in Lake Buena Vista to see what the rooms were like. Hawthorn Suites claims to be an all suites hotel with some executive rooms also. Upon our arrival we found this to be a big lie. Travelocity booked us into what they called an Executive King Guest Room. This does not even come close to a low cost hotel chain room. The bathroom had a 1960 style sink with no drawers for storage or shelves. Therefore, there bathroom items had to be carried back and forth from our luggage. There was no microwave or refrigerator in this room. This so called executive room had nothing but a king bed and an old outdated TV with lousy picture receiption. The maid service was not any better as our bathroom was never cleaned or room vacumn. Towels were changed and bed made and that was it. After complaining to the General Manager he told us we booked with Travelocity and therefore he could not do anything. Travelocity always books these bare rooms. If we were unhappy we had to deal with Travelocity. We called Travelocity and complained since they state they have a guarantee that is something is not right with your booked trip they will make it right. This is also a lie because they told us there is nothing they can do and they do not guarantee the conditions of the room. This experience has left my wife and myself with a bitter taste and since we travel alot we will make sure we never stay at a Hawthorn Suite again nor ever useTravelocity again. We plan to write both the CEO's of Travelocity and the CEO of the major chain that owns Hawthorn Suites to adivse them of the condition of the room and our trip experience. Both of these companies once they received payment basically said screw you and would not assist with the problem. The false advertising of the room descriptions to entice traveling guest to stay there should be reported to proper state authorities. I think if anyone choses this place you should will be booking at your own risk. This was the worse room we have ever stayed in including when we were fresh out of college and not making alot of money, the low end motel chains were better than this.

This is a big problem if you don't have a car. Maybe I should blame myself for not doing enough research before we went, however this hotel was advertised as running 'regular shuttle buses' to all of the major theme parks in Orlando. The shuttle bus to Walt Disney World ran three times a day in the morning. This sounds great on paper, however space on the bus is on a first come first served basis. Return times are also very limited and need to be pre-booked in the morning, not so ideal if you have children and you may need an unexpected return to the hotel. The bus drops off and picks up at Disney's Epcot and then runs through to Universal Studios. There are three big problems here: 1 - Reaching other Disney parks from Epcot in the morning is a pain, having to rely on Disney transport and changing frequently often via a Disney hotel. 2 - Universal Studios is in the complete opposite direction of Disney from the hotel, meaning the journey is a long old treck. 3 - The last bus from Epcot is at 10:30pm, meaning you can't watch the Magic Kingdom fireworks at 10:00pm and make it back to the shuttle bus. Suitcases are not allowed on the bus and therefore making early check-in at Downtown Disney (we booked via Virgin) a nightmare to get to. There is also no scheduled transportation to Seaworld Orlando, which is another problem in itself. Besides the transport, the hotel itself is run to a fairly good standard, breakfast is a bit limited and doesn't beat the build your own option at Denny's.", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, SP", "Title": "\u201cA good surprise\u201d", "Author": "Vergilio", "ReviewID": "UR93460422", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at this hotel.

That said there was fresh fruit of some variety every day. The kids loved the half basketball court and small swimming pool, and the adults really appreciated the hot spa when aching feet couldn't take any more pounding!

From there we had to take the monorail to the transportation center, then another monorail to Magic Kingdom. The whole episode took over 45 minutes!

I've put that the hotel was 'very good', but if there had been an option for 'good' then that would have been more appropriate. The pros were the lovely big & comfortable beds; just what you need after a long day in the parks (they are that good that I've emailed the company that makes them to find out if I can buy one!). The rooms were spacious enough for myself, wife and daughter to relax in (though I think a family of 4 would find it a bit awkward, what with both double beds in the same room, at least in the kind of room we had). The staff, from reception to cleaners were all friendly, helpful & unintrusive (We had a problem with the loo one morning and the maintenance man was sent straight up to fix it). The bed linen was changed every other day and the room was spotless. The location is excellent, on a road away from the main drags but within easy driving distance of both Disney & Universal, with a host of places to eat a short walk away. The cons are that the decor and furnishings in the room are quite dated and in need of updating (the walls are painted a kind of ochre colour and this tends to make the rooms a little dull and gloomy). There was some peeling wallpaper and borders in our bedroom which was a bit untidy but not a major problem. The breakfast is plentiful and the quality was okay - my wife loved the porridge - but a little 'samey', with scrambled eggs and/or meat patties/sausages - no bacon or fried eggs for instance, but again not a massive problem for us. The room lacked a kettle to make tea (though you could make coffee if you wanted) and my wife felt there should have been more crockery/glasses etc. Overall we had a good stay at the Hawthorn Suites because we treated it as a base and spent most of our days and evenings out at the parks or in restaurants. For those reasons we found it sufficient for our needs. Would we stay there again if we came back?

If you love a comfy bed, large room that is like an apartment and proximity to everything, you will enjoy the Hawthorn on Palm Parkway. We arrived on the Amtrak on 6-27 and stayed until 7-4. To begin with, I would have GLADLY paid an extra $5 a night to have shuttle service to the hotel. But, they don't provide it. I had to arrange and pay $40 for a shuttle about 5 miles away. I would have gladly paid another $5 a night for a taxi or shuttle to the airport, which they don't provide. That was another $40. Don't take the hotel shuttle to the Disney theme parks. We took the 8:30 pickup on Monday the 28th....and arrived at Magic Kingdom at 10:45!!!!!!!!!! The lines were already horrendous when we got there. So.....I followed a tip I found online about taking the DEDICATED Link 50 public bus to and from the Disney parks. AMAZING!!!! For $2, you can be at the Disney parks in 30 minutes, in a clean, cold, safe bus that ONLY has a route just for Disney parks. It dead ends at the Disney transportation center where you get on the monorail and go to any Disney park! Better yet, I followed another tip online to a) leave the park around 2pm (when it is the hottest and lines are the longest) and b) return around 6pm (after the cooling afternoon showers and when the lines are short). We did one full day, nonstop (which was a total nightmare) and used the hotel shuttle and we did another day 9am to 2pm and returned at 6pm, using the Link 50 route. The difference was stunning! Not only did we get to ride Big Thunder Mtn and Splash Mtn twice each but also two other rides by 10 am BECAUSE we took the Link 50 bus from right in front of the hotel!. We bought an \"all day pass\" for $4.50 and $2.25 for kids and rode off and on all day, with no delays, in comfort. Also, the Link 50 runs every 30 minutes, beginning 1 hr before and 1 hr after the parks close. So, my best advice: avoid the hotel shuttle and use the Link 50. The complimentary breakfast is free....because it isn't good enough to charge for. But, it is convienent to inhale on the way out the door to attractions. The afternoon \"social\" is a joke. It is the cheapest heartburn beer and wine and isn't worth paying for. Most everyone that stayed here was from the UK or other countries in Europe. My guess is less than 10% of the visitors were American. The front desk employees are horrid. They are rude and condescending and lazy. One particular insult to me was, when asking for a baggage cart over the phone, to \"come downstairs and get it yourself\". Another time, I asked for some butter from the bar downstairs so we could cook some grilled cheese sandwiches in our room. I was told to call back in 2-3 minutes because he was \"busy and couldn't deal with that\". I called back 10 minutes later and BEFORE he ever said hello....he greeted me by saying \"Jeez, you're persistent, aren't you?\" Don't ask them to find a phone number for you, for any local information, for help, for anything. They resent you and hate their jobs and hate you too. Also, for the custodial staff, be prepared to speak Spanish only. Being from Texas, I was fine....but other Europeans were completely lost trying to communicate with them. And the housekeepers begin knocking on doors at 8 am to clean. They did it EVERY day while we were there. The rooms are spacious, the bed is amazing, the kitchen great! We went to Winn Dixie, 2 blocks away, on our first day. Spent $70 on bagged, frozen complete meals, some lunch fixings and some snacks and that lasted us all week long! We probably saved $400 not eating out. A cooler cost us $7.50 at Winn Dixie and we took that around with us. While you have to ask for enough dishes from the front desk (to which they will insult you for asking them to do anything), the kitchen was like an apartment and fully functional. The housekeeper even does the dishes for you! (a tip would be welcome) We stayed on the 2nd floor and had the laundry right down the hallway. It is expensive and not the best....but it works. Besides the great rooms, the best thing about this hotel was the location. Staying on International Dr or anywhere near there is torture and we learned to stay away from there a long time ago. Palm Parkway is calm, clean, quiet and pretty. Best of all, because there's no traffic, getting to and leaving from are quick and hassle free. It is also on that dedicated Link 50 route for Disney parks. Its also 2 blocks from a huge shopping center where you can get any and everything. The pool, jacuzzi and fitness room are all well taken care of and provide plenty of clean towels. On the whole: for rooms and location: a 10.

The hotel taxis were expensive for short trips, but if you asked for/called a metered cab, they were very reasonable (compared to London). Metered and hotel cabs were comparable for longer journeys (e.g. to Universal). We used both, as we weren't driving. Lots of restaurants between 5 and 20 mins walk away.

I relied a lot on the other reviews written on this site and felt compelled to do the same. My husband and I have a 9 year old and an almost 1 year old and were looking for an affordable place to stay, within close proximity to Disney and Universal. We needed a place that would allow breathing room after being at the parks all day and for our littlest one to roam around after being in the stroller all day. Hawthorne Suites was perfect for that. It had a small kitchen...perfect for us though...plenty of counter space...nice size sink...normal size refrigerator and microwave...nothing miniature about it....perfect for small meals and bringing back leftovers! We had the room with a king size bed...we requested a crib once we got there and although it wasn't in the best condition, the pack and play was just what we needed. Our oldest slept on the pull out couch and had zero complaints...he had his own TV so that made him happy as well. I did notice there is some sort of gaming control hooked to the TV but didn't look into it at all. The living area was perfect for our small little family....a recliner and a small couch. The bathroom was clean which made me very happy...it was also a nice size...had plenty of counter space for all of our stuff and a nice seat to sit at while getting ready....The only complaints I think I could make are that we had to go down twice to ask for toilet paper (although we chose not to get housekeeping everyday, which is probably why we were not fully stocked) and there was not a lot of drawer space for \"big packers\" such as myself.

You can only get the seaworld shuttle if you are Virgin customers and must book on it at reception the day before. Shuttle to Disney World okay, although there are a few pick up stops on the way, but the shuttle to Universal - you have to get on the Disney World coach and it goes there first then onto Universal, you seem to be on the coach quite along time, Virgin need to sort this out.

If you rely on hotel/public transport and you like to be in walking distance of a lot of shops/restaurants then you would be better staying at International Drive, however, at the Hawthorn, you are within walking distance of several restaurants - Perkins, Dennys, IHOP, Red Lobster, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, Macdonalds, Black Angus (we loved this steak restaurant, one of our favourites.) Hawthorn is a couple of mins drive from I4, and downtown disney, in Lake Buena Vista. There is a pharmacy and a doctors couple of mins drive away also. The doctors is open usually till 8pm, very good service, I had a chest infection :( very expensive though, over $250, we paid upfront, and claimed from our insurance when we got home, but I think if you take your paperwork in with you, they can sort the payment through them there and then. HOTEL We arrived at the hotel in the evening, and the desk was manned by Jason (Jason rules!) who upgraded us to an executive suite (Living room, kitchen, separate bedroom) We like our hotel quiet, and this one suited our needs perfectly. (Again, if you want to have your children entertained at the hotel, this may not be ideal, the pools are small, but there is a small games room and a basketball court) The breakfast was complimentary, if you expect a feast, this isn't for you. You get the basic choice - 2 cereals, toast, usually either bagels or waffles, porridge, and 2 hot items, ie sausages and scrambled eggs, tea, coffee. juice - you serve yourself, so you can eat as much as you want. (What do you want for free?! ) The hotel decor is what I would call basic American hotel standard, nothing special, but it all seemed new and clean. We never saw any litter in or around the hotel, it was always spotless. The maid service was always good. (If you don't have a 'do not disturb' sign, just ask a maid, she will provide one happily) We have been to Orlando many times and have stayed at a lot of hotels, and we would definately stay here again, another one of our other favourites being the Fairfield Inn at the Mariott Village, Lake Buena Vista. (Which has a full breakfast with every item you could think of being offered - for those of you who like a hearty breakfast!) TRAVEL We booked our hotel, car and flight (virgin) independently, I would recommend this if you have a few hours to trawl the internet, and it is always cheaper than going through a travel agent. (Internet prices always vary each time you check, but I've had previous deals through Expedia, Opodo, Travel Republic, Travelocity to name a few) and every time I have beaten the travel agents by at least \u00a3100 per person. Virgin have always been the best choice for us for comfort on the flight, however, this time they weren't as good as usual. (dirty planes, surly staff, inedible food, broken T.V. screeens etc) however, I would recommend them for their early check in at downtown Disney on your homeward flight. You can check your luggage in from 8:30am, then you can have a full day at the parks, and when you get to the airport, you just go straight to passport control. Please note though, that they will charge you $10 each for this service if you have not booked ALL of your holiday through Virgin travel agents.", "Date": "January 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "aberdeen,scotland", "Title": "\u201cwhat a lovely reception we got at this hotel.\u201d", "Author": "gamboid", "ReviewID": "UR53227301", "Content": "my husband and my son and daughter and i,booked this hotel back in january 09.After travelling for nearly 23 hours,the very freindly receptionist jason,had us booked in within minutes.The hotel was very clean with maid service to your room every day which was exellent.The food was good if you liked eggs,and there was plenty of fruit,bread,bagels,even porrige.The wine and beer in the evenings were lovely.My son really enjoyed the half basket ball court out side just over from the swimming pool.Because we were there for christmas the reception area was all decorated with a tree and stockings hanging over the fire place.The only down side was the pool is not so big,Christmas day was just another day over there,so we will be staying in the uk at christmas time.We really enjoyed this hotel and would stay here and in the lbv area again.", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cAvoid it!\u201d", "Author": "PWTPWT", "ReviewID": "UR53048578", "Content": "We visited South Florida and did our share of hotels.

During our stay, we were able to work out some important kinks. PRICE: We booked early and prepaid at a time when there was a special offer - ended up only costing $80/nite. BREAKFAST: They love their sausage and eggs. (some ham or bacon would have been a nice change). The only variety with the hot items was the shape of the food. Work around this by varying the type of breakfast you eat each morning (combo up fruit, yogourt, waffles, English muffins, toast, bagels, peanut butter, jam, cream cheese, pancakes, eggs, sausage, cereal, juice bar, and coffee in any way you desire) Breakfast was a great time saver when trying to maximize your time at the park. SHUTTLE: the hotel offers 3 morning departures and 3 evening returns to/from Epcot. This worked fine as long as you schedule your day accordingly. If not, arrange a taxi(not the hotel taxi - i'll discuss next} or try to catch a shuttle at another hotel. Be aware that you must prebook a pickup time with the driver when you board or phone to get on the eve shuttle(even when we called though the driver still did not have our name on the list (: ) A car may have been more convenient but a litlle confusing for 1st timers to find your way around, and definitely more expensive ( gas, rental, park parking $14). TAXI: the hotel taxi has a flat rate of $30 to Epcot! Call a Yellow Checker Cab instead- $17 to Epcot or take the Checker Cab to a Downtown Disney hotel (called \"hotel plaza\") ($5) - their shuttles run every 1/2 hr. to several parks. We caught the same shuttle back, and then would taxi back to our hotel. The busses MAY also run to the parks from Downtown Disney transter station (our cab was cheaper and closer to a Downtown Disney hotel though (Double tree or Best Western). POOL: Was pretty small - nothing fancy, but was a nice area to lay around in the sun. LOCATION: the Hawthorn is not very close to convenience stores, but a 15 min walk or a short taxi ride will get you to a couple of food marts. Also, some decent restaurants are the same distance (Olive Garden). Delivery food (Italian, pizza, Oriental) became our specialty when we were at the hotel. Portions are quite large.

This was altered without any bother. Our room was on the 1st floor up looking on to the car park ( which was not really a great view as it just looked onto the car park and land that is dormant). The room consisted of a large bedroom with 2 double beds, bathroom, very small living dining room and kitchen. The bedroom was fine, clean, comfortable. Bathroom fine, The living area could do with updating, my son slept on the sofa bed and it was a bid worn out and could have done with being replaced. The kitchen again is very dated and was units were quite badly chipped. This put us of using the kitchen so we tended to eat out. Breakfast was okay but the hot food choices were very limited and not vegetarian friendly. Other than that you had the usual cereal, sometimes fruit was fine but not as good as the breakfast we had when we stayed at the Country Inn around the corner a few years ago. Staff in food area did not speak english so had trouble explaining about daughters nut allergy, needed to find someone to translate which was inconvenient. The pool area was small but nice. The only downpoint was that we noticed that someone had left a present in the spa pool ( luckily this was before we had went in). We brought this to the attention of reception staff who sent someone to have a look but nothing was done. I dont know if they left is to disintegrate or if someone did eventually clean it but we did not use pool or spa after this again.

The apartment room was light and spacious and the large seperate bedroom was ideal to house my two teenagers (especially as it was my honeymoon, and all being in the same bedroom would have been a nightmare!!!) Staff were very courteous and helpful, but my only complaint is that when we asked for a spare duvet for the sleeper sofa, we were just given an extra blanket instead & were left feeling slightly chilly some nights.The swimming pool wasn't huge, but was ideal and never crowded. A perfect cooler at the end of a hot day. Breakfast was slightly limited in variety, but bearing in mind that it's included in the price we were pleased overall. Beware of the people selling excursions tickets at the hotel entrance........my husband and son decided to take a trip to Kennedy Space Centre, whilst my daughter & I opted to stay local and do shopping. The display board at the excursion desk quoted about $38 for an adult ticket, and no extra costs were explained when my husband booked the trip. When he got onto the coach he was actually charged nearer $200, and was told the extra costs was the coach fare. Please make sure that you ask for the FULL price of excursions that require transportation to make sure you don't get caught out in the same way. We struggled to pay the statutory 15% tip for everything, as we're used to only tipping for a good or excellent service and begrudged leaving a tip for mediocre or poor service. I got the feeling that some restuarants weren't too keen on the English as a couple of waiters pointed out to us after the meal that a tip had NOT been automatically included in the bill (in other words, don't forget to leave me something). This incensed me, and made me feel less inclined to leave extra. On a parting note, one final word of warning to anyone driving on the I75 from West Florida back to Orlando. On the final stretch of road up to the I4, the road is swarming with traffic police, and I was issued with a heft fine for speeding.

The earliest arrives at 8:45am (instead of 8:20am as scheduled) and actually get to Epcot only at 9:30am. Then you will have to take extra disney transportation to go to one park to another.

I suggest getting a room on the bottom floor close to the lobby so that you do not have to walk far to the breakfast area or to your room after a long day at the parks. Luckily, our rooms were on the bottom floor with close access to everything, such as our car. My party had two rooms and both rooms were ready and clean when we arrived. I will list the pros and few cons of our stay at the Hawthorne suites. PROS- Room: The fridge and kitchen were a plus even though all we did was stock up on drinks and snacks. My mother in the other room actually used the kitchen to cook and had no problems. Just as others have pointed out, the beds are extremely soft and feel absolutely heavenly. Room service was always done well and there was plenty of room. Lastly, internet service was complimentary in the rooms and the connection was perfect. Breakfast: I stayed for a week and waited for bacon to be served (other reviewers stated they served it) but they never did. The only hot items alternated were scrambled eggs, sausage, and corned beef. In addition, some days waffles and english muffins were served with toast offered everyday. Cereal and fruits were offered everyday. We ate the breakfast everyday because even though it was not high quality food it was free and you can't complain about something free. Cereal and bread taste the same no matter where you go anyways. If you still crave something more delicious, a Denny's, Ihop and Waffle House are close by. Location: The location was perfect for us since we had a car. I highly suggest renting a car to get to the parks and not using the shuttle, which I overheard some guests complaining about. The shuttle will take a long time to get to and from the parks and you are also restricted to few pick-up times. We got a great deal on a car (about $130 with taxes and fees for the week) and great deals can be found on the internet. Also, if you plan on going to Universal then having a car would definitely be more cost-efficient since the hotel does not offer a free shuttle for that park. There are plenty of restaurants within a couple of blocks of the hotel, close access to I-4 with Disneyworld about 5-15 minutes away depending on which park you are going to. A Wal-mart which we frequented was also about 5 minutes away by car. Since the parks close early, I suggest eating breakfast at the hotel, lunch at the park, and dinner out of the park to save money. CONS- Bathroom: The bathroom is in need of a renovation. The shower curtain was not large enough to block the the water from spilling onto the floor. The toilet seat was cracked and chipped and the shower smelled of sulfur. Lastly, some of the towels had stains or were thinned out. Once the bathroom is revamped the hotel room would be perfect. It would be an added plus if the hotel could keep up with other properties and replace the televisions with LCD TV's. OTHER TIPS/COMMENTS: Before my trip, I did extensive planning and found the book, \"Unofficial Guide to Disney World\" to be quite helpful. I suggest using the touring plans the book offers to minimize waits in lines (we never waited long in lines!). Also, if renting a car I suggest either bringing your GPS or renting one from the car company. I also want to emphasize that the hotel is not too close to restaurants or stores in terms of walking distance and is somewhat isolated from heavy traffic. On the other hand, if driving then everything is just a couple of minutes away and very close by. The front desk also prints out boarding passes which helped a great deal when checking out. OVERALL: I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Hawthorne Suites mostly due to the fact that the beds were heavenly, free breakfast was convenient, great service throughout the hotel and convenient location.", "Date": "April 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Doncaster", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to go back!!\u201d", "Author": "teetersonheels", "ReviewID": "UR27397639", "Content": "Spent 2 weeks at the Hawthorn Suites in March. While we were there it was my mum's 73rd Birthday. Before travelling I phoned the hotel on the off chance they could get me a Birthday cake - It was there, on the table in the room when we arrived, and it was beautiful!!! I was travelling with a teenage son, and my mum (now 73), so we appreciated the space in the rooms at the Hawthorn Suites - didn't fancy spending 2 weeks with just a bedroom between us. The suite was great. Very clean, and spacious. All the reception staff were very helpful, and answered all our queries. Palm Parkway is a 10min stroll away, with lots of choice for eating out. As others have recommended; Uno's, Olive Garden, TGI Fridays, plus lots more depending on your taste. We also went to Cici's buffet restaurant, which for $8 each lets you eat as much pizza & salad as you could possibly want, with dessert thrown in. I chose not to hire a car (my mum is the worst passenger in the world here at home, so on holiday it would've been a nightmare!!) We used the shuttle bus from the hotel, which was always on time, sometimes we caught the shuttle back, or caught a cab back to the hotel. We didn't spent a lot less than the insurance package & parking fees in getting around. I know it was a little inconvenient, but to anyone wondering, you can definately get around without having a car. The free breakfast was a plus. Fresh fruit, cereal, muffins, waffles, bagels and something hot (sausage, scrambled eggs) Previous reviews have commented that the breakfast is a bit repetitive - I must be a bit predictable, I tend to have the same thing for breakfast everyday at home, and appreciated the choice available - and it's free!!!!

We booked on Travelocity for $70 a night, so for 4 nights, we paid only a bit more than we paid for ONE night at the (gorgeous) Wilderness Lodge last year. What the Hawthorne lacked in pizazz, it made up for in value. Pros: - Very clean, although a bit worn in spots (our room had a hole in the chair upholstery, hole in the carpet, and a hole in one of the towels) - Quiet (located on a pleasant, quiet side street off the main highway) - Roomy. The suite was perfect for our family of four, plus two grandparents who stayed on the (very uncomfortable) sofa bed one night. - The main beds were amazingly comfortable - Internet access was free (not sure why other reviewers had to pay - we accessed free WiFi from our room) - Very close to Downtown Disney, and an easy, pleasant drive to Sea World. Not too far (by car) from Disney parks... the drive to Magic Kingdom took us about 15 minutes. Cons: - The pool is very small - more like a private home pool. - The breakfast was underwhelming - after three days, I was pretty tired of orange wedges, toast and eggs. - You pretty much have to have a car. We didn't try to take the hotel shuttle, but I never saw one while I was there, so I doubt they come very frequently - While the hotel itself was quiet, the plumbing was ridiculously loud. Our first night, we were woken 3 times by neighbors showering. Not sure if that was just our room/wing (room 202), or the whole hotel, but we were pretty peeved with that.

With our daughter being 8 and wanting to do everything possible - Universal, Disney etc - me wanting to cram as much into 17 days as I could, and my wife putting up with both of us the ideal hotel was somewhere that we could use as base camp. We didn't want to be immersed in Disney 100% of the time, nor did we want to be sat on a bed in a hotel room on the days and nights when we needed to rest. Next time we'll probably get a villa as friends will be joining us, but this time we wanted exactly what the Hawthorne Suites promised in the brochure and on the website. I'm glad to say that everything we expected from the suites we got. The hotel is easily found in your rental car from the airport (Brit Tip - I took my Tom Tom and downloaded the Florida maps from the Tom Tom website before I went - I think it cost \u00a319 but it's cheaper than hiring a Sat Nav over there and it was priceless!). There is ample free parking around the hotel, we went in peak season and there were always loads of parking spaces available. The location of the hotel, on Palm Parkway, really couldn't be better. We can recommend Olive Garden and Giordano's for eat-in Italian and we enjoyed the Flippers pizzas (which we had delivered to the hotel room on a couple of occasions - NB the hotel encourages you to order take-out delivered to your suite). There are a few supermarkets to choose from within a minute or two in the car, aswell as pharmacies. And the parks are all 10-15 minutes in the car - just enough time to get organised and get excited about each day you had ahead of you. Basically, we always felt that the hotel was in touching distance of everything we could ever need to make our holiday perfect. On arrival, check-in was fuss-free, and the staff were always smiling and attentive. Our suite on the 5th floor was possibly the furthest away from the reception but was still close - sometimes hotels can be so huge you feel out of it, but this was still close. The room was a great size, with separate bedroom, bathroom, vanity room and lounge/kitchen area. It couldn't be described as luxurious, probably functional, but that's what we were looking for. Although we are only a family of three, we each needed our own space to relax and with two televisions, bed, chair, sofa and dining table we could all do our own thing without getting in each other's faces. Lots of plug sockets allowed us to keep everything charged, and the tables allowed us to spread all out things out so we never felt anxious about all the clutter we were accumulating. Everything in the room worked (kitchen, bathroom, free wireless internet access) and it was always kept clean by the staff. Towels were changed as often as we requested. Hard to put into words, but on a holiday like this it's so important to have somewhere as welcoming, comfortable and spacious as this to prepare you for all the fun you're trying to fit in. The free breakfast was perfect for us. One of us went down each morning and grabbed coffees, juices and whatever was on offer (sausages,pancakes, eggs, bacon, waffles) and brought them back to the room. Each day it meant that we had already had our first coffee of the day and enough sustenance to keep us going until late morning when we could get an early lunch - thus missing the lunchtime crowds. Only once did we take advantage of the free beer and food. The small games room was handy, and the pool area was small (although we'd have gone to Spain if we wanted a pool/sun holiday) so if your kids want a big fun pool this is not the place to be. Bear in mind that you've got Wet & Wild, Aquatica and the 2 Disney waterparks to satisfy those needs! The problem when planning a trip to Orlando - especially when coming across from the UK - is that there are so many things to do and it's the kind of holiday most people only do once a year or once every 2 or three years. One hotel or suite can't cover all bases. Last time we stayed at the Polynesian, and the AKL. Next time we may be with friends and rent a villa. Depending on the kind of holiday you want and the ages of the people in your family you'll choose different hotels/villas to suit. If you're looking for a good solid foundation for your trip, and want space, ideal location for the parks, restaurants and shops, friendly staff and somewhere to unwind then choose this hotel.", "Date": "November 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Erie, Pa", "Title": "\u201cVery impressive for price!!!\u201d", "Author": "samsab8", "ReviewID": "UR22000723", "Content": "I will definately visit here again when staying in Orlando!!

We had stayed in LBV before, so knew the area but not this place. Initial impression was \"oh my g*d!\", the as the entrance hall had a traffic cone in the middle and the floor looked unsafe, but it turned out they were in the middle relaying the entrance hall and it was sorted a couple of days later. Check-in was efficient and pleasant and our suite was located on a high floor, just as we had asked. The suite consisted of the following: The door from the hallway accessed into the 'living room', in which there was a bed settee, separate armchair, good size TV (with games) and a couple of low tables. There was also a dining table with 4 chairs and an adequately stocked kitchen, complete with dishwasher (but no corkscrew!). The living room connected direclty to a bedroom with two king beds, with TV, phone and enough storage for two adults and a 6 year old. From the bedroom there was a door to a separate 'dressing area' with a wash basin, good size shelf, big mirror and a hair dryer. From the dressing area there was a door back into the living area and another to a bathroom, containing a low bath with a reasonable shower (water pressure was ok but could be better) and a WC. There is no safe deposit in the room, but there are free safe deposit boxes available at reception. Maid service was daily and sheets were changed every 2 days. In the communal area was a dining area where they served the free breakfast. This was a buffet providing cereals, fruit, various breads and a varied hot selection (eggs, bacon, corn beef hash etc.) over the course of the week. It was more than enough for us, although the lack of selection raised a few complaints (wot, no grits?) - but it was free and saved you having to go out and buy breakfast. There is no bar, but there was a 'Manager's happy hour' most evenings where there was free wine, beer and nibbles. They have a games room with a few arcade machines and internet access is available on 3 machines if required. They have a relatively small pool, but you don't go to Orlando to sit by the pool, and there was sufficient seating on the occasions we used it. They also have a hot tub - great to relax after a long day walking round the parks and I saw a basketball hoop as well. The staff were very courteous and on the couple of occaisions we asked for something, they were obliging and sorted us out quickly. As regards location, it is located on Palm Parkway, which is relatively quiet, when compared to I-Drive, but there are plenty of good value family friendly restaurants close by - Olive Garden, Perkins, Black Angus Steakhouse, Giordanos, CiCi's - most of which are in walking distance if you fancy a 10/15 minute stroll. There is plenty of shopping and the discount shops are not far away. One huge benefit, when compared to I-Drive, is proximity to Disney. Downtown Disney and Typhoon Lagoon are less than 10 minutes drive and the Magic Kingdom only 15/20 minutes away.

The suites are spacious, they are identical to each other apart from some being the mirror image with regard to layout. We had three suites because we wanted space for each couple but for anyone on a budget you couple easily fit 6 people into a suite, it would be a bit difficult with regard to the wc and bath but do-able. I liked the fact that the vanity area could be shut off from the bathroom and bedroom. There is a well equiped kitchen with a large fridge, dining area and a sofa bed and easy chair in the lounge area. TV's in both rooms, Iron and ironing board (NOT used by me). We stayed in suites 505. 507 and 509, we knew this to be a non smoking hotel but on entering our room (505) we all noticed a stale smokey smell that wasn't noticable in the other suites . The suites were cleaned daily and replenished with clean towels, soap, shampoo etc but it did get a bit late some days before this happened. We didn't go to the parks everyday and so wanted to be able to use our room to change to go swimming in the pool but sometimes housekeeping hadn't refreshed the room by 4pm. All very un-impoortant in the grand scheme of things but a little annoying when you are on holiday. My main gripe had to be that the pool gates remained locked until 9am, I like to get up early and sit by the pool in the early sunshine to read my book until my hubby gets up but the only place to do that was out in front of the lobby which also attracted the smokers. I know I have moaned a lot about little things but on the whole it is a nice hotel. The staff are friendly and very helpful and I would consider returning if they unlocked the pool earlier. The hotel is well located for Disney and its not that far to Universal either. Premium Outlets is not that far away for some great shopping too. We ate at the Black Angus Steakhouse just up the road on a couple of occasions and also at Uno's and Denny's and had good meals and service at them all. We look forward to returning next year as long as the pool gate is unlocked.", "Date": "October 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cA great off-Disney-property alternative\u201d", "Author": "Joselle", "ReviewID": "UR21038425", "Content": "GENERAL: We were pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness of the room. It's wonderful when traveling with young children (7 & 5) to be able to put them to sleep in a separate room. There is a TV in both the bedroom and living room, a table to eat meals at, and a full kitchen. Only thing lacking was an oven, and really, who needs that on a vacation? The rooms were modestly decorated, but clean. The separated bathroom area was really great (tub/toilet in one room, sink and vanity in another area. Also, there's a little stool to sit on at the vanity area.) The pool area was modest, but decent; it was never crowded when we were there. Pool towels were a little joke between my husband and I - more like a hand-towel. We needed two of them to dry ourselves off. ;-) The jacuzzi is nice and hot, and was great on the one rainy day we experienced! Overall, from making reservations to checking in we were met with pleasant staff. The housekeeper did a great job, and would always arrange my kids \"lovies\" (stuffed animals) in funny ways on the beds. LOCATION: The location is great! You're just a few minutes from Downtown Disney, a couple blocks from Winn Dixie grocery store (good chicken to go!), and many restaurants (Bahama Breeze, Macaroni Grill, fast food, Carving Station, Asian, etc.) There's a mini gulf place among all the restaurants down the road, and a hop/skip/and jump from Hwy 4. AVOID THE SOVIENIER shops along the main drag! The stuff there is way overpriced - no bargain at all - you might as well buy the stuff at Disney. The Walmart has a small Disney area and we got a couple things there cheaper than anywhere else (take Hwy 4 East to get to the Walmart. It'll be on the left hand side of the hwy near one of the International drive exits.) CONS / AND A WORD ABOUT THE BREAKFAST: Only thing I didn't care for was the \"full, hot American, breakfast buffet\" (quote off of Hawthorn Suites own website). On Sunday, the breakfast was none-too-tasty scrambled eggs (powdered eggs maybe?), brown & serve sausage links, canned fruit, English muffins, packaged waffles, cereal, juice, milk and sludge coffee (this was the best day for breakfast; it just went downhill from here.) The second day of our stay, the breakfast was plain runny oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, brown & serve sausage links, fruit, bagels, cereal, juice, milk and coffee. Are you kidding me?! I hardly call that a \"full hot American breakfast\". Another day they served sausage gravy and biscuits and my husband couldn't eat more than one bite (maybe I've spoiled him with my own cooking, but he said it tasted like it was made with liverwurst, which is generally a clue that very cheap sausage was used.) Anyway, my suggestion if you're comparing this hotel to others is to not take the breakfast included here into your decision making process. The food isn't that great, and you'll likely end up buying a box of donuts or cereal at the Winn Dixie a few blocks down the road like we did, and just hit the \"buffet\" up for juice, milk, and a plain bagel.

Our family (13 yr old son) typically stays at Hilton and Marriott family hotels and we were pleasantly pleased. We take 3 vacations a year and with the price of Disney we decided to look for a better hotel price. It has been 6 years since visiting Orlando and we knew that much has probably changed. The hotel looked very nice on the outside and the lobby was impressive for being a value hotel. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating to all our needs. The rooms are clean and a good size with a separate living room that includes a kitchen/dining area. The full size frig was a nice change from a dorm size. The pool was small and the walls needed be cleaned better. The plumbing was very loud when the shower is turned on so light sleepers will wake up. The location is right around the corner from the Embassy Suites we stayed at before which is good but it \u00bd mile from Disney property not the parks. You are about 5 miles from Magic Kingdom and a couple of miles from downtown Disney. You are down the street from Wal-Mart and Universal Studios. The only drawback is that there aren\u2019t many restaurants in the area for walking or short driving. The breakfast is OK if cold cereal, rotation of mini store donuts-bagels-English muffins-frozen waffles, toast and rotation of hard boiled eggs & pre-fab eggs along with canned fruit and rotation of apples-oranges-bananas, then this would be good for you. I would suggest going out for breakfast if you eat a big meal. I was not expecting much for the price of our room but other value hotels offer better food at breakfast including the airport Hawthorne Suites which we stayed at for 1 night. They offer a manager reception similar to Embassy as they said on Mon - Thurs 5.30 p.m. - 7.30 p.m. The only problem is that they only offer free beer and wine (out of a box) and soda along with chips. On Wednesday they did offer burgers but we didn\u2019t have them since they were not appealing and there was nothing to go with them. Again the airport hotel offers a full bar with limited selection of hard liquor. We had booked another hotel for 3 nights (Comfort Suites in Kissimmee) and after driving up to that hotel, we decided to call Hawthorne back to see if they had any rooms. The Lake Buena Vista location didn\u2019t have any rooms for that night but they booked us at the airport location and then back to them the following nights. We were extremely pleased with their level of customer service. When it was time to leave we needed to print SWA tickets and they have a room with computers available to print for free. Bottom line, this was a great visit and we will be staying at this hotel in the future and other Hawthorne Suites. We can live without the breakfast or managers reception because we saved about $60 a night and we can buy a lot for that.

If you read the reviews on this site the majority say the same thing and it's the majority that are right.

Free breakfast is a little limited but always sufficient choice, if a little repetitive. For a change try Shoney's appx half a mile away and Fantastic! Pool area and pool itself are quite small but are normally deserted so the small size not really an issue. I would confirm that a car whilst not essential, was definately worth while as downtown disney and seaworld, being the nearest attactions are probably 2 miles away. As had a car we didn't use the hotel shuttle service. I did speak to other guests about the shuttle and it didn't appear to be the best ever! There are plenty of good value places to eat nearby and for something a little better try the Olive Garden which was fab. When the tropical storm struck Orlando we were kept fully informed by the hotel who put on films in the evening for the children to help relieve the boredom of being confined to barracks during the storm.

Thanks especially to Bernard for getting me the UFC results on the internet and thanks to Mike for the basketball tips. Yes they also have a basketball court to work off some of those burgers and chips you eat in the parks. The pool is ideal, as it is just the right size for keeping an eye on your children whilst you can relax at the side.

We bought the Foder's Disney World book and visited TripAdvisor many times before we decided on a hotel. After much thought, my husband and I chose Hawthorn Suites Lake Buena Vista. We chose this hotel over staying on Disney property. (This was our first trip to WDW too.) We decided that having a suite, a hot breakfast and a good deal def. won over staying on Disney property. When we got there, we felt a little disappointed at how far the hotel seemed to Disney property. (We drove our own car.) After going to Disney the first day we realized that you can't walk to any of the theme parks so there's really no point in staying on Disney property anyway! Where ever you would stay, you either need to drive, take a shuttle or a monorail. After getting over that realization, we noticed how easy it was to hop on and off the highway to arrive at the Disney theme parks. Now, on to the hotel itself! The front desk people were absolutely fabulous! They were very helpful and enthusiastic about our staying with them. We got a suite on the 2nd floor of the hotel with 1 king size bed. We stayed here with a total of 5 people. My husband, myself, 7, 6 and a 3 year old. The girls shared the sleeper sofa and my 3 year old took turns sleeping with us and her sisters. The king size bed was delicious and so so comfortable. (Especially after walking ALL day at the parks!) The girls were comfortable in their sleeper sofa as well. We actually cooked lunches on the stove top. We would wake up early go eat our hot breakfast (which was great) then we would go off to the parks and return for lunch. The night we arrived we went to the local Winn-Dixie and bought a few things for lunches and snacks. The Winn-Dixie is within walking distance of the hotel but we drove there. It is about 1/2 mile behind the hotel. After lunch we generally we take a nap or a swim at the hotel pool. The pool itself is not anything grand, simply a hotel pool. After a swim we would go change and head out back to the theme parks. Our rooms were generally cleaned while we were at the pool or right before lunch. We stayed at this hotel for 5 days and we got a discount because of that by booking on the hotel web-site. (Under specials and packages) There are two things I didn't mention that weren't a big deal at all, but I feel I must mention in order to validate this review. These 2 things of course are the negatives! I didn't realize there was a laundry room on the second floor. I called down to the front desk were a young guy who I hadn't spoke to before answered. I asked if there was a laundry area in the hotel. He said \"No.\" I asked if there was a laundromat somewhere around town. He said, \"Look in the yellow pages.\" I said, \"Um, there are no yellow pages here in the room. Do you have a place where I can get on the internet to look it up?\" He says, \"Yes we have a business center but we charge for getting on the internet. I guess I'll have to look it up for you and call you back.\" (Was this guy for real?!) Long story short...he never called back but it was ok because I mentioned the story to my husband who let me know that I obviously I could not see since the laundry room was clearly 2 doors away. hahaha Anyway, so he was the ONLY non-helpful person in the entire hotel. The second negative I had was that our toilet stopped up easily. We actually had to ask for a plunger. If you added too much toilet paper it seemed to want to overflow. Not a big deal, but alittle embarassing to have to ask for a plunger! Anyway, so all and all we had an excellent experience at this fabulously clean, comfortable and overall wonderful hotel! This is the perfect hotel for families wanting to save a little money, who have a car and are wanting to enjoy Disney in a beautiful and comfortable hotel!", "Date": "June 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blyth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Great Service\u201d", "Author": "MrCelt", "ReviewID": "UR16651434", "Content": "Booked through Virgin Holidays to this hotel, and must say that as an accomodation it was excellent. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite, which was very spacious, with 2 bathrooms and a small kitchen-ette. The maid came in each day, providing fresh towels when needed and also putting any extra glasses, etc into the dishwasher! The pool area was small, but rarely busy and we were able to get into the water or the hot tub whenever we wanted. Throughout our stay we found that all of the staff were helpful, with both enquiries about the accomodation and the Area in general. The breakfasts did have a limited choice, but there was always something there to get you ready for the day, with an ample supply of toat, cereal and coffee! The cooked items varied every couple of days, nothing earth shattering, but not bad to get you going. The area around the hotel was pretty quiet, as it is the last hotel on Palm Parkway, before the Floridian Wilderness begins. This is a prime location and I think that development will take place in the near future. There is already a massive new Hilton being built a little way up the road. The Hawthorn Suites is a small complex, on 5 floors, and on a busy morning they opened the conference room as an extra space for people to have breakfast. As a non-driving option, we found the amount of local eateries, etc a little limited, although there are a few places in the nearby \"Buena Vista Shoppes\", including Cici's, Dominos, Hooters and \"The Carving Station\", which had an excellent Buffet dinner and a nice outside bar (We spent pretty much every night here - great company and Karaoke!). The property is also further from Downtown Disney than advertised. The 1/2 mile is to the \"Downtown Disney area\", with the shops and attractions being a couple miles further down the road. The free shuttle buses from the hotel left a little to be desired. They did feel as if they were about to fall apart and never ran on time. With several other pick-ups, it usually took between 40 minutes and an hour to get to Epcot - its only drop off and pickup point in Disney. During our stay, we also visited Sea World, Discovery Cove and the Orlando Premium Outlets. These were all around $15 each way in the hotel's preferred carrier (Usually in a well decked out 4x4), otherwise it was about $10 each way in a checker cab, which we found to be a reliable way of getting around. Overall, an excellent choice for accomodation if you are looking for a quiet retreat from the parks, but you would probably be able to make more of the area if you have a car.

This is the perfect place to base yourself if your looking to get the best that the Theme Parks have to offer. On arriving late after a flight delay we were really impressed by the look of the hotel. A relatively easy checkin although the one and only complaint I have was that there wasn't a crib waiting and we were told that they are provided on a first come first serve basis not great when you have a tired 10 month old!! This was eventually sorted and so the start to a great holiday. We had 2 x 2 bed appartments and were really impressed. The kitchen had a full size fridge, dishwasher (which house keeping put on nearly every day even when there wasn't much in the sink!), microwave, 2 ring cooker, coffee machine and all the basic utensils needed for a snack or meal. Bedrooms were lovely, beds really comfortable, 2 bathrooms and 3 tv's - one in every room! The air conditioners is a bit noicy but you do get use to it very quickly and its just was you need after a long day at the parks Breakfast included set you up for the day and included eggs (mostly scrambled) bacon or sausage, bread/bagels/waffles, cereal, fruit, juice, coffee and tea on tap. The managers reception Mon - Thurs 5.30 to 7.30 is an added bonus and lovely touch. We only managed it a couple of time but it included beer, wine and soft drinks and snacks. On a Wednesday there is hot food when we were there it was bread, burger and beans. Basic but lets face it they don't have to do it. Coffee available on tap 24 hours a day - in fact we used to fill up our pot rather than making it in our room The pool area is clean and you can always get a sunbed. Pool perfect for a dip and includes a jacuzzi and basket ball area if your feeling energetic. Or there is the gym room with treadmill and other equipment. Location is excellent for exploring all the parks and Lake Buena Vista and of course shops. Seaworld is 10 mins drive, Disney is 20 mins, Down town disney 10 mins drive, Orlando Premium Outlet 10 mins drive. In my view you do need a car but can walk to local shops and restaurants. About 10 mins walk and you'll find a selection including Olive Garden Italian (my fav - great take out), Black Angus Steak, Crab House, CiCi Pizza (what a bargain), Macaroni Grill, Chilli's the list goes on. Just watch out for the sprinklers in the evening along Palm Parkway a couple in our party got soaked!! Michael on reception recommended a lovely chinese who deliver to your door! They also have Papa Pizza who deliver. If your travelling with a baby the variety of baby food is limited. We tried Walmart, Walgreens and Goodings. Only when we found the local Winn Dixie 3 days before we came home which is 2 mins drive was there a wide selection. Too late for us but will save you giving the same thing day in day out - Beware of taking any products including baby food with pork product in ours was thrown away at imigration.

The staff also made little displays with our daughters' soft toys on the bed every day when they cleaned, which was just a lovely touch for them! The location was great - we were very close to all the disney parks and downtown disney and also were close to some great shops and restaurants.

Well, the first room they put us in had torn up couch cushions. We immediately called the desk without putting our things down and they moved us to another room. I will break this down as pros and cons: Pros: This room was fairly clean and there was quite a bit of space for a family. Hot water for showers. Cons: there were holes in the sheets, towels and blankets. The paper towel holder was coming out of the wall. The shower head was unscrewed so when we turned the shower on, water went everywhere. The soap holder in the shower was coming off the wall. The TV remote had dead batteries in it. The dishes were filthy and disgusting. We decided to stay here since it had a free shuttle and free breakfast. What they don't tell you is, at least in December, the shuttle only runs three times a day and you have to make a reservation so if you want to come and go from the park you really need a car. The breakfast is a joke at best. We actually ended up going to the grocery store and buying some items to supplement what little decent food they did put out. Do not count on this breakfast to fill you up before a long day at the Disney parks. The left hand never knew what the right hand was doing at this hotel. The service was awful and they always seemed one egg short of a dozen. I have to say that I will never stay at another Hyatt hotel again.

The hotel was very clean throughout our week long stay in Florida. The location of the hotel was fantastic. Turn right out of the carpark you were in Disney or turn left and you were on the road to Seaworld, Universal and Discovery Cove. You have to remember this is America, everything is spread out so you would need a hire car wherever you stayed in Orlando! We have been to Florida 6 times and have found this to be the best place in terms of location and cleanliness. The hotel provides free beer, wine and soft drinks between 5.30 and 7.30 (normally stayed open longer) on Monday to Thursday evenings. On wednesday evenings they also provided burgers and hot dogs. We found the free drinks brilliant. We were able to come home from the theme parks, have a couple of drinks and then walk about 5-10 minutes to lots of restaurants at the end of the road. (Including Olive Garden, Chillis, Slizzer). We did not have time to use the pool area so can not comment on that. My mum and dad are quite particular in the standard of hotels they stay in and they loved this place. Staff were very friendly and always said morning or hello etc. when they saw us. The breakfast did vary every day although there was not lots of choice. For example one day would be sausage and boiled eggs and another day would be bacon and scrambled eggs. Everyday there was toast, fruit, cereal and drinks. You have to remember the breakfast is free and very convenient. If you had a busy day you didnt have to waste time travelling to a restaurant. Also the rooms had a kitchen if you wanted to make your own breakfast. Our flight left in the evening and the hotel let us stay in our room for another couple of hours so that we could have a shower before making our way to the airport. Overall i would highly recommend this hotel. I slept on the sofa bed and had a good night sleep every night and never heard any noise from other rooms.

All staff we came in contact with were very friendly and helpful. The room was very nice and impeccably clean! Every day when we returned from the parks the room was immaculate. For the two of us, the size of the suite was absolutely perfect. The hotel was very quiet too. We never heard our neighbors or any traffic. The breakfast buffet in the mornings was sufficient to prepare one for the days' activities. Eggs, pancakes, waffles, biscuits and gravy, sasuage, tater tots, toast, bagels, fruit, and coffee are some examples of what was served for the morning meal. While not a 5 star breakfast, we were very content with what they served and it was a great way to get fueled up for the beginning of the day without having to pay extra to eat out. We never used the pool, but it looked very nice and every time we passed it, there weren't a lot of people there. We also had a rental car so we didn't use the shuttle service. The hotel was very close to the Disney parks-didn't take but 10 minutes or so to get to them from I-4 (a little longer if we decided to take the parkway that took you by Downtown Disney-it was a nice change of scenery from the interstate). There's a Super Wal-Mart on the same parkway the hotel is on (just a couple of miles past the 4-way stop) which was perfect for food shopping for meals we prepared in our room's kitchen. I would say that if staying there, I would definitely rent a car. Then you'll be able to not only go where you want when you want, but you'll also have more of a selection of shopping/restaurants to go to.

Therefore, when vacationing in Orlando this summer, I decided to stay at this hotel again. Perhaps it is under new management, but I had major issues with this hotel this time around. Firstly, upon arrival, I was told that they did not have the room that I had reserved available. How unprofessional is that?!?! What on earth is the point of reservations if they dont' actually reserve the room for you?!?! They told me they'd put me in a different type of room for the night and would move me the next day. This was annoying to me because i did not want to waste the whole next day waiting around for them to find me a room to switch to. I was there to vacation!!!! Not hang around the hotel lobby while they tried to deal with their screwups!!! Then, I asked them what they could do about the price since it was their screwup. So, my price for the night was reduced by $30. After spending the night there, i should have received full compensation! Here's what happened: AT 1:40 AM, SOMEONE ATTMEPTED TO BREAK INOT MY ROOM!!! Someone inserted a key card into the door and opened it!!! My sister started screaming. I went to check it out and sure enough. The lock was open. The security bar that we had put against the door had been moved. Someone had had access to our room, while we were sleeping. Thank God for that extra security bar, because I had not used it, the intruder would have been able to get in instead of merely opening our door a couple of inches!!! I have stayed in hotels before, but i have never had this before! THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON THAT ANYONE OTHER THAN THE OCCUPANT IN THE ROOM SHOULD HAVE A KEY TO THE ROOM!!!!! Needless to say, we did not sleep at all that night! We were freaked out. And we jumped at every little noise! And there were a lot of noises!!! The fridge and air conditioner are really really loud!!!!!! The next day, we spoke with the manager who claimed she'd never had such a thing happen before and that she was going to launch an investigation and check out the log book to see if she could find out who had broken in. Of coure, they never found out anything. I felt that we should have totally been comped for the night, cuz for all the \"safety \"and \"security \" we had, we may as well have been sleeping all night on a park bentch!!! After that wonderful night , the manager moved us right away to a different room in the morning so that our day was not killed. The rest of our stay was ok. The fridge and a/c made all kinds of weird noises. But there were no more intruders. Our next problem with the hotel was on our last day, when i requested a late checkout. After all the aggravation they caused us this trip and after everything we had experienced there, they could not grant us a late checkout. Oh, I\"m sorry. Regualr checkout is at 11, so a late checkout would be at 2 and they'd charge a half day's rate. I needed the room til 4. They couldn't do it for me. They said they'd have to charge me a full day's rate for that! Like I said, considering all we had endured there, it should have been a no brainer and a freebio!!!!! (since they had not comped the first night). They also presented us with a different rate for our stay than I had made reservations for. After arguing at the front desk, they made the changes in their system and changed the price back to the original rates I had been promised. Two words: Thourougly aggravating!!! I would not recommend this hotel! I strongly suggest you seek elsewhere. Yeah, reservations can get mixed up anywhere, but when you go on vacation, you want to have a sense of comfort and security.

We took the free shuttle to Epcot, it was always late leaving the hotel and takes around 30-40 mins to get there as you have to pick up from other hotels in the area. The shuttle itself has seen better days, the windows are scratched so you can't see out of them and the air conditioning was just about working. This hotel was about a 15 min walk to get to restaurants, shops etc and after a long day out at the parks, heat at night etc you do not want to walk any more!! The selection of restaurants are limited, TGI Fridays, Kobe (fantastic), Crab House (Yuk, the fish tasted of chlorine) Sizzlers (looks like a dining hall inside but the food was ok, cheap and plenty of it) and a chinese at the end of palm parkway that i would avoid at all cost, we left the entire meal as it was so awful. The rooms are a good size not massive. We had noisy neighbours(young lads of 15-18 years) and I heard every word at 2.30am, in the end I phoned the front desk who sorted it out for us. However after they left we enjoyed a good nights sleep, we found the beds to be very comfortable. The swimming pool was great after a long day at the park, it never got really busy and you could always find a bed. Because the sun is at the back of the hotel nearly all day long even when you get back you can still catch a few rays or swim in the pool.

We triedd the lunch buffet at Pizza Hut and also the Indian Palace restaurant on Palm Parkway (both were excellent). - The hotel itself is almost the last one on the street so very quite area. - There are lots of shops such as Winn Dixee, Walgreens just north on Apopka Vineland roaed. - There is a major outlet center and a Publix on the south side of I-4 (on Vineland road). - The best feature was the proximity to Downtown Disney with the Disney marketplace being literally a 5 minute drive. - The theme parks were very close as well and a short drive back after a whole day at the Magic Kingdom. - International drive etc are also 15 minutes away. Kitchen etc: - One reason to select this hotel was the kitchen etc which was well equipped. This is a real time saver since you can quickly fix a meal after a long day at the Theme parks. Overall a great hotel.

The hotel in our opinion rated \"above average\" with just a few things that require minor maintenance. We arrived at 7am one morning having flown 12 hours from New Zealand to LA. Then a 7 hour stint at LAX airport before flying 5 hours to Orlando, all in all more than 24 hours without decent sleep. Anyway, they allowed us immediate access to our room even though check-in is about 2-3pm-ish. This was a fantastic gesture on there part. But I guess this was because the hotel was virtually empty with only 3-4 families at the free Breakfast each morning. The hot part of the free b/fast varied in quality and was probably a bit on the fatty side for our taste. The pool was also virtually to ourselves but I can appreciate previous reviews written here that it is a small pool if the hotel had lots of guests. Our kids are 14 and 16 and they enjoyed it. We caught the free bus to WDW for 6 great days. It drops you at Epcot but the buses and Monorail to other parks were usually very efficient and ran regularly. The lines at the parks of WDW were non-existent except for one day at Magic Kingdom. We did Animal & Magic Kingdom, Epcot, MGM Studios & both Water Parks. It was 90degrees most days and had only 1-2 heavy rain showers that lasted only minutes (and not a Hurricane in sight). We took most of our own food with us from NZ because we don't enjoy high sugar/fat foods. There is a WinDixie Supermarket about 10-15mins walk away (good exercise) or if you have a car then 3-4mins. The kitchen facilities were great for our family situation enabling us to cook our own dinners and make our own lunches to take to the parks (even though signs say not to take food into the parks).

We were repeat customers of the Hawthorn Suites Sea World and decided to give Hawthorn Suites Lake Buena Vista (Savona)a try this year, mainly because of its location. I must say that when we first heard that Hawthorn LBV was now Savona we were concerned with our reservations. The director of sales, Kathy Tobin was a big help and did a wonderful job calming us down. But from the moment we arrived at the hotel, we knew that it was going to be a marvelous stay. We stayed from Dec 3 to Dec 18 and it literally became our home-away-from-home for these wonderful 15 days. Let\u00b4s be more specific: 1. The LOCATION is the best you can get. The hotel is located at 8303 Palm Parkway, Lake Buena Vista, less than 2 mins from SR 535 and the Downtown Disney entrance. We have stayed at two Disney hotels before (Coronado Springs/All-Star Movies) and felt kind of in the middle of nowhere. That\u00b4s not the case with Savona. Exiting the hotel make a right towards 535 and you are in the middle of everything: The Crab House, Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill, Pizza Hut, McDonald\u00b4s, Post Office, two Walgreens, Wal-Mart, Orlando Premium Outlets(off 535), Black Angus Steakhouse, Sizzler, Dixie\u00b4s Supermarket (good prices), Gooding\u00b4s Supermarket (expensive), Ponderosa (off 535), only to name a few (really). Nothing compares to this location; 2. The HOTEL is lovely! It\u00b4s new and looks like it. As you walk into the hotel you\u00b4ll be greeted by a beautiful lobby with an enormous chandelier and an exquisite floral arrangement on a marble table in the center. To your right is the front desk and the staff is always helpful and friendly. There\u00b4s a sitting area with a fireplace and when we were there, there was a Christmas tree . To your left is the dining area where breakfast is served everyday. It\u00b4s a continental breakfast, not the hot one they used to serve but it\u00b4s still good and...free. I think it\u00b4s ridiculous to give this hotel a not so good review based on its breakfast. The great majority of the Orlando hotels don\u00b4t have any breakfast at all. So, I think that having cereals, milk, hot beverages, juices, bread with two toasters, bagels, muffins, donuts, jam, cream cheese and fruits is a nice way to begin your day and plus you get to avoid the hassle of having breakfast at the parks. To your right are the corridors with plush carpeting and soft lighting leading to the rooms and the elevators (big and nice looking too); 3. The ROOM is just as lovely as you see at their site. Big, beautifully decorated and cozy! Ah, and no funny smell too. We stayed in a King Suite. First of all, there\u00b4s a full kitchen and I mean full. There\u00b4s a big refrigerator with ice-maker, dishwasher, microwave, toaster, coffee maker, two burner stove top, and all the utensils you need. The dining area adjacent to the kitchen is charming with a wooden table and 4 chairs and a chandelier providing plenty of light when you eat. And then there\u00b4s the sitting room with a comfortable sofa, a couch and a 25\u00b4 TV with remote. The room was a really big one, with a king bed, a reclining chair, a work area, a dresser with 3 drawers, a big closet with lots of hangers, ironing board and iron, alarm clock, another 25\u00b4 TV and plenty of room for our 4 gigantic bags (I love shopping!) . The bathroom is pretty much standard, with a tub and a shower (a good one) and a big sink outside with all those nice toiletries; 4. The HOUSEKEEPING was terrific! Not too much of an intruder but always making sure the room was clean. Everyday when we came back to our room everything was looking good, the bed was made, the dishes had been washed, we had new towels, new tissue box or whatever was missing before but our stuff was untouched. Perfect! Spending our hard earned vacation in Orlando is our definition of heaven but staying at the Savona Suites upgraded our expectations even more. Now we are officially spoiled!

If you are considering not staying here because of the name, think again. Just about everythig is exactly the same as the Hawthorne. As soon as we arrived in the hotel lobby, we were greeted by a courteous front desk staff. They warmly welcomed us into the hotel, and in minutes, we were up into our luxury suite. When you walk into your room, you will be shocked with how much it has for so little money. You will immediately see a kitchen to your left fully equiped with utensils, plates, cups, pots and pans. As you continue walking, you will see the living room, with a fold-out sofa bed, and 20 inch TV. Walk past the door, and you get to your bedroom, with two queen beds and another TV. Last, if you walk right, you will come to your bathroom. Another important thing in choosing this hotel is the breakfast quality. Each morning, from 7 to 11 am, there is a free continental breakfast. Although it is not bacon and omelettes, it is still pretty good for no money whatsoever. Last, but certainly not least is Savona's relation to the theme parks. It is only about 10 to 15 minutes away from the magic Kingdom, whether you take I-4 or local roads. This is very important, as after a long day, you want to be able to get back to your hotel.

Would stay there again. Room was clean and quiet (The only things that counts in my book) Staff was courteous and attentive. Disney is just a few minutes away, quick access to Interstate 4, restaurants and grocery stores near by. Since it was off season, the price I paid made it a great value. I also appreciated the attraction/ticket desk at the hotel. In other Orlando hotels I have stayed at, the people manning the desk would almost tackle you to get you to their desk. I've actually have had someone yell across a lobby to get my attention once... (I was trying to ignore them) This not only happens in hotels, but also at most of the family restaurants too in Orlando. At Hawthorn Suites, the attraction/ticket desk was more like a Concierge desk. A service to you, not a outlet for someone to sell you something. Okay now the downside, if you really need to have one... As you have read from other reviewers the free breakfast does gets old for us adults. Menu is basically an assortment of instant oatmeals, 2 of the same cereals, donut or danish, 3 juices, orange slices, apples, toast, French toast or waffles, bagel or english muffin. The hot items were sausages, tater tots, and scrambled eggs or pre-made omlettes. Don't know why they couldn't add more variety to the hot food offerings. The kids didn't complain and if they were happy; my wife and I were happy. Besides, it saved me at least $30 each morning. Cha ching! Was planning on using the free bus shuttle to the park to save the $8 daily parking fee. You have 3 pick up times at the hotel (7:50am, 10am, 12 pm) Now the catch... You also had to specifiy when you were going to return when you were dropped off at the EPCOT transportation center. If that time was going to change, you needed to give 2 hours notice to the transport company. Pick ups at EPCOT were (6 pm, 8pm, 10pm). These scheduled times may change throughout the year, but in September all of the parks were closed by 9pm to the general public. Trying to predict when we would leave the park with the children in toe was hard. Especially if we planned on staying late for the show/fireworks and tired little feets were still needed to walk quickly to make the pick up in time. The 10pm at Epcot was cutting it way too close even when the other parks were closing at 8:00pm. If you're going to use the shuttle service, you'd better plan. We ended up driving because our children are young enough that falling asleep while standing is still a possibility. Last time we were at Disney, I ended up carrying 2 kids totalling 100 pounds while my wife dragged a stroller and 8 month old from the Magic Kingdom to the world's 4 largest and probably farthest parking lot.
