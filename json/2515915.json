Some of the previous reviews I read made me think a little bit but when I got there, all those concerns were gone. We were greeted by Juan who was so unbelieveably helpful. The customer service was top notch, anything you wanted, you got. Once we got into the room it was even better. The beds were not \"too soft\" like other reviews had commented...they were great. Very clean, & even better there was internet connection in each room. The free breakfast was delightful & they provide free shuttle service to the parks. Now unfortunately, (through no fault of the hotel) I got sick my 3rd day in, we were supposed to stay 4. I explained to the staff that i was sick & wanted to leave & they said they would call me to see what to do with my 4th night. They actually did! It was amazing service from start to finish.

The breakfast staff are very active in keeping everything up to date in the morning, oatmeal fixed, clean area, well stocked etc. They are really on top of this! The bad is a very short list but is my biggest need in a hotel room, the bed. I am very easy going and I don't expect too much in my opinion but the bed is a big one to me. The ones in our room are doubles and the matresses are very soft and very old which made for a tough night of sleep. Getting on to I-4 is easy. Food is good, oatmeal, waffles, cereal, lots of goodies. While the hotel is very busy, the noise level was very low. Cookies everyday!

The two reasons I picked this hotel were for its location and the free breakfast. (and we had Marriott points to get the room free!). As another reviewer mentioned, the rooms are pretty basic -- I agree! It's also true that the A/C units are noisy - sounds like they could use some servicing. The rooms are a bit small for a family and they really should offer more rooms w/ 2 queen beds (or at least one double and one queen). A double bed just isn't big enough for two adults to comfortably share! And I think the matresses are just old - not necessarily soft on purpose. If you sit on the edge of the bed, they really sink down. The sink/vanity area are very small w/ just one sink. Only one person can use it at a time - again not super functional for a family. Perhaps we should have considered getting a larger room but other hotels we've stayed in have more accommodating room layouts. If you are traveling w/ just 2 people, I think this room would be fine. Or if we were just staying for a night I could more easily deal w/ the cramped quarters. The free breakfast is fine. Again, fairly basic offerings but it's better than paying for something! The pool is ok - small but fine for a quick dip. They provide towels out there, which is nice. The best part about this hotel is its proximity Universal Park. It's about a 5 minute ride on their bus or a taxi and maybe a 20 minute walk. There are also a wide variety of restaurants nearby that are slightly cheaper than eating at the theme park. Oh, and the shuttle to Universal leaves only once in the morning & picks up @ Universal twice at night. Not super convenient and we ended up taking a cab a few times but it only cost $5. All in all, an ok stay. However, I would probably pay a little more money (or use a little more Marriott points) and stay at a little bit nicer hotel next time around.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, FL", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel if you're going to Universal\u201d", "Author": "bhsu21", "ReviewID": "UR128256922", "Content": "We stayed here just one night and I used a free Marriott certificate.

We didn't have any problems with it. there is a fitness center but it's just a treadmill, elliptical machine and weights. Really tiny. We checked it out but didn't use it. The bed was softer than we would prefer but you might like it. The only bad thing about this hotel and that's why I had to take off a star was the free breakfast. I know it's free but I've had free breakfasts at the Doubletree next door and the Hampton right down the street and they are 10x better than here. They had breakfast sandwiches you could heat up, but mine was dry and no flavor. They had a waffle machine. I had Fruit Loops. They had your typical bagels and toast.

We had the front desk call the cab for us since we were leaving at unusual times. The first cab ride was in a van, and the cost was $8. When we came back from Universal the driver told us the fee would be $5 or $6. When we got to the hotel he told us we owed $7. The next morning the hotel called a cab for us again. This time he took 2 families in the van. I assumed that we would split the cost. I asked him what the cost would be, he told me $10. I gave him $5 plus his tip and went on my way. I could hear him yelling as I was already on the escalator to Universal. I assume he was wanting the entire $10 from me.

I hope you find this information very useful. The Fairfield is located in a convenient location near plenty of places to eat that are walking distance. Many local restaurants to choose from are very close, with delivery as an option for most. We had pizza delivered once by Flippers. It was good stuff. Not top shelf, but it will not disappoint. Ale house across the parking lot serves good bar food and has sports on the TV. I think the Ale house is the place to handout on the weekend; parking lot is crowded in the evening. Good starting point if you want to drink, because city walk drinks can be expensive. Free breakfast is included \u2013 need I say more. I will, the regular employee, Nadia was very sweet and helpful. She made the waffles each morning, served breakfast, and clean up after us. I gave her a tip, and she gave my family 4 bottles of water each day, and a bunch of bananas plus special K cereal snacks. If you stay here please tip, since your breakfast is free. Breakfast alone will cost you while staying in Orlando, where a tip is how they make a living. I deducted some points here because of the eating area chairs had sticky arm rests from syrup- those kids and their waffles. :) The rooms were very clean, no bed bugs, or spiders, or dust. Only the cleaning service was slow to make their rounds, and they usually did our room around 4pm, and on one occasion, we interrupted her to do a quick change for the pool. A little CON here - I think they need to get them done earlier in the day incase folks want to clean up and go to another park mid-day. They have a place to come back to and change quickly. But hey, we only spent the week sleeping, where most of the time we were out and about. The front desk folks are great too. Javier and the others were very accommodating. I asked for extra blankets and pillows for the kids because they were on the pull out sleeper. I use one of the extra blankets for adding cushion to the bottom of the thin mattress and allow support for the girls. The kids found it comfortable after adding it and making the additional layer. TIP: This hotel is even close to universal, approximately one mile to bus and taxi drop off point. On one occasion, we crossed the street from the Ale House, and went through the landscape into the Portofino hotel backyard. There we found our way through their hotel and to a water taxi into universal studios. It was sort of criminal, but adventurous for all. If you visit Universal Islands of Adventure wear you bathing suits. You will get wet and you will rash up if you do not \u2013 you know what I mean. I see too many people visiting from other countries wearing jeans and shorts only to be paying $5 to get them dried. Speaking of other countries, the last week of August has folks coming from Brazil. They are very rude people. Beware of them. The brits were in town at the same time, and I found them polite and charming. Just my observations. Places to eat: Margaritaville Hard Rock TGI Fridays Ale House Things to do: Do the Disney Typhoon Lagoon \u2013 The swim with the fish in a real salt water tank was nice. Do the Blizzard beach \u2013 Great Slides and the kids have great areas to hang out? Ratings for Aquatica and wet and wild were not high. I passed by the wet and wild and it looks cheesy. Do the Island of adventure - Harry Potter Castle ride first, it backs up fast and it is located in the very back.

We were looking at a Marriott property close to Universal and this was the closest we could find. I was using points, so it didn't costs us a thing but it was more points than your normal Fairfield Inn just because of the location. Location: The hotel is just around the corner from Universal. It was an easy 10-15min walk. The walking entrance is the same as the valet entrance. It is easy to find and has a well laid out walking path. You could drive and park in the garage but it really wouldn't save that much time and you would be walking nearly as far while paying for the garage. There are a few restaruants really close and quite a few for delivery. Citywalk is pretty close too, so it you decided to have a few adult beverages you would be OK to stagger back to the hotel or at least grab a cheap cab ride. Hotel: The hotel was a little taller than your average Fairfield Inn. It is undergoing a restoration at the moment, but I didn't see any sign of it other than the little plastic hardhats and construction signs everywhere. Pool was OK, but pretty small. Breakfast was cereral, waffles, microwave sandwiches, yogurt, and muffins,but nothing fancy. Room: We were upgraded to a King Studio which I was told was recently remodeled. For a new room, there were a few things that didn't look new. Nothing major, but more wear than a new room should have. The bed was comfortable. The ammentities were standard. The room had two flat screen TVs but not high def. Movies on demand were available. The staff was all extremely friendly (Juan especially) and tried to be helpful. I asked for walking instructions to universal the first morning and the lady was not sure. Hint: If you have \"near Universal Studios\" in your name, everyone there should know chapter and verse about Universal! BTW: tipping housekeepers gets you better service. It really shouldnt be that way, but it defiantely made a difference. Warning: The firedepartment/lifesquad is directly across the road and they are going out ALOT!!! Great if you have an emergenc.

Since we arrived at the hotel at 12:25 PM, I wasn't optimistic that a room would be ready, but Steffanie happily informed us that there was a room available. It wasn't so much the fact that a room was available that made us feel welcome. It was the way Steffanie greeted us and didn't hesitate to help us that made us feel comfortable and at ease to ask questions. We asked her if it was an easy walk to Universal, and she gave us directions and taxi information in case we chose to ride back by taxi instead of using the shuttle service that only operated at a certain time.

Nadeza kept checking to see if we needed anything at our table and brought us yogurt to eat later and bottled water. She cleared dirty plates and bowls from our table too. We watched her as she tended to other guests with the same beautiful smile and cheery attitude. She even gave us each a kiss on the cheek as we left the table and made sure we had our fill of coffee. Upon check-out, we asked Steffanie for directions to an outlet mall nearby. She immediately printed out the directions for us. Nadeza was still in the breakfast area cleaning up with her big smile.

A few of the Cons: - A nearby fire station could stir up quite a commotion, when the fire trucks would roll out. - Universal Studios is right around the corner, so there is a critical mass of hotels in a small area. This Fairfield is squeezed in behind a strip mall on one side, a busy road on the other and two other hotels on the remaining sides. Consequently, the parking lot fills up quickly.

I wanted to book the Homewood Suites/Orlando after a great experience with them (using tripadvisor ratings for Albuquerque). They were full. I had a REALLY good experience with the Comfort Suites Universal in 2006 and wanted to see if I could get a better deal. I went with \"Fairfield\" thinking I was booking the #1 hotel with Tripadvisor. 2 weeks prior to my vacation I realized that when I went to the Marriott website to book my vacation I was somehow switched to a different Fairfield Inns & Suites. I kept the reservation hoping it would be okay. I had hoped to have a reservation including 2 rooms, one with 2 queen beds and a living room with sleeper sofa and TV...plus kitchenette including microwave and refrigerator. Boy was I disappointed when I received one room...NO Refrigerator...NO Microwave. Two beds plus a small sleeper ....SMALL SMALL SMALL. In 2006 We had stayed at the Comfort Suites Universal and received a MUCH BETTER DEAL.....2 beds with larger sleeper sofa....Large rectangle refrigerator and microwave plus some snacks provided. I would stay there again...it was cheaper than this stay! .... I will never stay at this Fairfield again. To me, there are much better deals than this. And I am one of those reviewers that really are more positive than I should be. To recover from the shock....we requested a refrigerator and they complied. However the refrigerator they sent was so small and never really worked. No microwave. The breakfast was (to me) not as great as Comfort Suites. Basically the same but no sausage. They had Breakfast Sandwiches, you cook them in the paper. The most positive thing I can say about this place is that they are very very close to Universal so that when the 'bus' came we were the last 'pick up ' and one of the first 'drop off' stops to get on. You are close to a Burger KIng, a Golden Corral, a Carraba's and there is a Convenience Store close by. The Cookies were nice at check in as was the Check in Clerk. There is a really nice Housekeeping guy that taught me some Spanish at the elevator. They have Lancome Shampoo and Conditioner.

Not for good reasons The Fairfield Universal is a dump! Avoid at all costs. The hotel was so horrible I needed to cut my stay short and take an emergancy cab ride to the Fairfield International Drive. The Fairfield International Drive is a 5 star resort compared to the Fairfield Universal. My issues: 1. I called up to get a non-feather pillow due to someone in the party who is allergic. I was told the hotel doesn't have them. As a result the person slept without pillows. 2. I was told on the phone the pool was heated. It is not. It's freezing cold 3. The jacuzzi is too hot so it's not possible to go in. Owning a jacuzzi I like it as hot as possible (107, 108). The temperature was so hot, its not fit for a human to go in. As a result I burned myself. The Fairfield International has a heated pool and a jacuzzi at the perfect temp 4. It is NOT within walking distance to Universal. Complete lie. 5. The room #s have paper signs. Nice touch! 6. The Fairfield Universal is not in a safe area. The Fairfield International is in a much safer hotel complex. I booked the Fairfield Inn & Suites Orlando Near Universal Orlando Resort thinking it was nicer since it was more expensive than the Fairfield International. Huge mistake! Still have the burn from their jacuzzi. By the way both hotels use the same complimentary shuttle service. By staying at the FFI International you are costing yourself an extra 8 min each way but much better off! If you have a choice stay at the Fairfield International. Save some $ and be much happier with a HIGHER QUALITY HOTEL. Front desk is extra friendly. Do NOT STAY AT THE Fairfield Inn & Suites Orlando Near Universal Orlando Resort.

We wanted a clean, smoke free hotel, with free parking, free internet, free breakfast, in a safe location. We got everything we wanted! It is in a great location, right next to the entrance of Universal and close to International Drive (for restaurants, entertainment, and shopping). We stayed in a King Suite with a fridge/microwave. It was nice to sit on the couch and watch t.v. and then go to the \"bedroom.\" The mattress was firm and comfortable. The hotel is very clean and the internet connection was great because the cord could reach the table, couch, and the bed. They had all the amenities that anyone would want (Pantene shampoo/conditioner, blow dryer, iron/board, newspaper, pool, small workout room etc.) Our room 616 was great because it was close but far enough away from the elevator and exit doors so noise wasn't a problem. The only issue we had, and it would be the same way in any of the area hotels, was the fire station that was across the street. The alarms would go off in the middle of the night (2-3 times a night, bring ear plugs) but obviously there is nothing you can do about that. There are restaurants within walking distance (Burger King, Kobe Japanese Steakhouse, Starbucks, Golden Corral Buffet, Carrabba's Italian Grill) and a Walgreen's that's great for anything you may have forgotten. The continental breakfast was nice, there were make your own waffles machines, bagels and other breads, hard boiled eggs, cereal, fresh fruit, coffee & tea, fruit juice etc. The cleaning staff even cleaned our room after we left the room after 2:00pm. The hotel staff was accommodating, we didn't use the shuttle but saw it picking up people for Universal right on time.

Rated as a 2 star, but clean and comfortable. We stayed at other 2 stars in florida, and this far exceeded what we expected. Cheapest price was through the Universal Studios website. Booked a King suite. Worth the little bit extra if traveling with kids. You get a divided off king size bed and an extra T.V. Saw the standard rooms (2 double beds) and they looked like the run of the mill hotel rooms...pay the extra for the suite. They have a little fridge and microwave, so bring your own popcorn and snacks. THE BEDS-The beds are VERY comfortable. Pillows are 1st class. Rooms are always clean. Breakfast is good...if they don't have what you are looking for, ask. The staff is very helpful. THE SHUTTLE-the only glitch in our stay. Watch the shuttle schedule-it changes (I think on Sundays) so every week is different. We got stuck paying for a ride home after a day at the park because the change...I told the front desk they should advise the guest of the change/when it changes, because it was very inconvienent to have to try and get back...expecting the shuttle. There are several shuttles during the morning, and several pick-up times in the evening. GREAT for people that want to sleep in, or go before the crowds. THE POOL-clean and well kept. Had to ask a few times for the pool towels to be brought out, but the staff was always friendly, and prompt. GREAT VALUE- I'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone. There is laundry on site (but be aware the hotel next door sends over their guests) which is good to use late at night, and reasonably priced. The rooms are clean and nicely furnished. Staff was friendly, and helpful. Location is kind of off the beaten track...but keeps the noise down. If you are energetic, you can almost walk to food stores.

Several restaurants are within walking distance, including one that is open late (I can't recall the name, but it was good). Two notes of caution: (1) The bus service was good, but the schedule was very imprecise. For example, a couple times the 10:30 AM bus never showed up because it overfilled from another hotel, so the 11:00 AM bus showed up (at 10:50 AM) to serve both 10:30 and 11:00 AM passesngers. Bottom line - the published schedule is not exact, but in the end, they'll get you there and back. (2) Be sure you get on the right bus coming back, especially if you wait till the midnight City Walk bus.
