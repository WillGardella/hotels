We drove in to the city and the arrangement they had for parking was great (make sure to get your ticket stamped). The Garage attendants even had my car pulled up front and ready for my quick early morning departure. The doormen were very nice. There was some very light construction going on but nothing that ever got in the way or was noisy. Everyone seemed helpful and for us it was an excellent location. We walked to almost everything we wanted to do (MOMA, Rockefeller Center, Shopping, Central Park etc, Time Square, Meals, etc.). I would strongly recommend it. To be fair and give an honest assesment what kept if from being perfect. I got stuck in the elevator for about 15 minutes. Thank the lord I was alone as it would have freaked out my kids. I had to call the front desk from inside the hotel as know one heard me ringing the alarm button. I was most surprised to find that after being stuck in the elevator and being helped by the engineer and doorman I never saw anyone from management or the front desk. I also never was given an appology or asked if I was ok. I was a bit surprised at that and that is the reason i only rate the experience as very good. I believe a phone call, or a smile as I came out of the elevator would have pushed this over the top. I would stay again, and but I did tend to take the stairs a little more frequently after that, lol.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Penticton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cgreat except for one MAJOR flaw...\u201d", "Author": "Kim J", "ReviewID": "UR127168575", "Content": "I stayed at the Ameritania for 6 nights with family...girl's trip!

Disgusting. Told the front desk (and showed them a photo taken on a cell phone) who were semi-apologetic and blamed the construction going on across the street (?). My family was reimbursed one nights stay, and a free breakfast one morning. they also had exterminators check out the room but who knows what happened to that little guy, never had confirmation they got rid of it. They were offered to change rooms also but they declined as it was going to be our last night anyway. (Personally I would have gotten the hell out of there!)

We had trouble hearing each other in the lobby when we checked in at 3 pm March 21. 2. Tiny room -we asked for a room away from the large construction site across the street. We were warned interior facing rooms are small but there was NO closet, only a tiny 2 drawer dresser about 2ft high. I have stayed in hotels around the world but never saw a room without a hanger! 3. One bath towel. Had to call down for a second one. 4. Safety issue- a large 5' x 7' wall mirror is leaning against our wall. Seems that someone forgot to install it. Hope it doesn't fall onto our bed and crush my skull. (our family staying in another room have the same problem.) 5. Double Booked the room - just now a man tried to get into my room. He showed me his keycard which had my room number. The front desk called to apologize and said the man had misread his number. Not true. I read it myself.

We were not disappointed. It was our first stay in Manhattan and we planned to be typical tourists during our 3 night stay. Location was ideal for the one Broadway show we planned (Jersey Boys) and the last minute decision to see another show (Once). \u201cJersey Boys\u201d was an easy quick walk (maybe 8 minutes) and \u201cOnce\u201d was about 15 minutes however, the sidewalks were were VERY congested (St Patrick's Day!). Lot's of eateries nearby & a Starbucks is 60 seconds from the front door. We intended to at least get a glimpse of the St Patrick's Day Parade, and we managed to do just that...about 10 minutes on foot brought us to a decent vantage point along the route on the southernmost edge of Central Park on 5th Avenue. Our first impression of the Hotel lobby was very good. It smelled great (really!), appeared scrupulously clean and the desk help was great. Friendly, helpful, cheerful folks seemed eager to please. We asked for a room away from the construction you've read about it in other reviews and they accommodated BUT the downside of facing away from the construction was an uninteresting view of exterior walls of the hotel; I would have loved a great city view but quiet was more important. The room was exactly the way it looked in their website photos... appeared updated, no wear & tear of any significance and again- clean, clean, clean. The room was on the small side but adequate. The bed and pillows were exceptionally comfortable \u2026. some of the best we've experienced. The bathroom was very nice with a walk-in full ceramic shower, a \u201crain\u201d shower head and a hand held shower. You may have read some squawks about the elevators; they did seem a wee bit slow at times but otherwise, previously mentioned problems seemed to have been cleared up. It's just a few amenities short of 5 stars... lavatories off the lobby, perkier elevators and a slightly larger room would have probably done the trick. All things considered, we consider the Ameritania a very good value and we are happy to recommend it.

Both times I booked online through the website for less than $210 AFTER taxes (I think the rates are going up as the Construction finishes). The location was great - very convenient to Central Park, Times Square, etc. The hotel is in the process of being completely overhauled but the construction is almost done. The lobby is modern and clean - and so are the rooms. The front desk staff was nice and accommodating. I arrived early (10:30) but they took my cell phone number, held my bags, and called me at 1:30 to say my room was ready (check in was at 3:00 pm). The room was small, but clean. The beds seemed brand new (no sign of wear and tear or bedbugs). Depending on what side your room faces it can be noisy as there is construction going on the north side of 54th. It is loud, but this is NYC. I didn't really expect to get a quiet hotel and was very impressed with the Ameritania given how little I paid. The bathrooms are small, but clean and new. The rain shower is nice, but something to note, the shower is open concept and doesn't have a door. I see in some other reviews that bugged some people. I snuck up to the roof and it looks like there are in the process building a rooftop deck area to hang out at. I was surprised it was accessible since it looked a little dangerous (mid construction) - so if you have kids or teens, and they are feeling mischievous, be warned. That evening before going out, grabbed a drink at the bar in the lobby. Drinks were surprisingly cheap (I'm going off Chicago prices) and strong and the bartender was nice. Checkout the next day was seamless. Another HUGE plus for the Ameritania was that I paid for my room on a debit card and they didn't put a massive hold on my card like some hotels and I wasn't charged until I arrived at the hotel, no reservation fee ahead of time. I stayed at Ameritania again in January after my great first experience. This time I arrived early again (10:30) and was told my room was ready right away, the desk staff thanked me for coming back to the hotel and upgraded me to a deluxe size room with a King bed. Again the construction across the street was loud during the day, but I was out and about so it wasn't a big deal to me and I sleep with ear plugs.

It would have been nice to have a refrigerator (e.g., minibar or plain fridge). We had our own coffee maker but if we hadn't, that would have been disappointing too. But the room really was pleasant to be in. My biggest complaint -- or almost-complaint -- concerns the bedding. I am extremely allergic to feathers and down. My wife saw the label on the blanket saying \"at least 70% down\" so we called the front desk for a replacement blanket. The receptionist talked to the manager and reported back to us that, according to the manager, none of the bedding was down. My wife told her about the label, and they backed off, and gave us woolen blankets. They were prompt and friendly, but had we taken their word for it, I would have suffered a bad asthma attack -- not a joke.

Upon arrival, I was told my booked suite was being renovated and was not available and that I would have to go over to the Ameritania. From the moment I walked into the lobby, the bad experiences started: 1. the room rate a the Ameritania Hotel was 60% of that for a suite at the Moderne but they wouldn't credit me the difference; 2. when I got to my suite, I called Housekeeping but kept getting a busy signal. I called the Concierge, busy signal. Each button you press gave me a busy signal! So I dialed \"0\", got the front desk, and they told me that none of those buttons is functional. I asked for the sofa bed to be made up, as my cousin was arriving on a late flight from Canada. Half an hour later, still no sign of Housekeeping, so I called again, and......... no Housekeeper arrived. 3. in the meantime, I discovered that the safe in the room was non-functional as the batteries were DEAD. So I called the front desk AGAIN, and they sent someone up to change the batteries. I asked this gentleman to please send someone from Housekeeping up. Then I left for dinner because I was starving and couldn't wait any longer. Upon my return an hour later, the sofa bed was made up. 4. There is NO hotel binder or booklet with information about the hotel and its services. 5. There is NO ice machine on ANY floor. 6. The stairwells look like a bomb was dropped into them. Holes in the walls, steep staircase, broken off or non-existent handrails. I discovered this when I went looking for the non-existent ice. 7. There is construction across the street. We were woken up @ 4 AM when the work began each morning. 8. There is NO concierge to book reservations, give recommendations, NOTHING. 9. The front desk is VERY bad at giving recommendations. We asked for a recommendation for a restaurant that was moderately priced but casual, and were directed to one 5 blocks away. We were told it overlooked Central Park but there was NO view of Central Park- and we sat by the windows!!!!!!!! 10. When we asked room service to bring us ice in a glass because we wanted to drink some water, they brought a small bottle of generic water, no ice, and charged us $5.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 11. There is NO restaurant in the hotel, just a lobby bar. 12. We went shopping on our third day there. Upon our return at 4 PM, one of the two elevators was out of service. We showered, changed, dressed and went out to a holiday function dressed in long gowns and stilettos. Upon our return, BOTH elevators were out of service and we were told we had to walk up that dingy, steep stairwell to our TWELFTH FLOOR room. 13. The next morning it was time to check out. The elevators had not been looked at and were BOTH non-functional. We were told there is NO service elevator and that we would have to bring our suitcases down twelve flights of stairs because the bell boys were overburdened. Imagine the situation with everyone trying to drag their bags down those stairs to check out. One father had his little 3 yr old boy trying to walk down the stairs holding the non-existent (in many places) handrails, while he tried to carry the suitcases down. One of us had to take the little boys had because we were afraid he was going to fall, it was so steep and treacherous. 14. The valets kept pushing sedans on us all the time, instead of hailing taxicabs, as we requested. 15. There are NO services in the hotel- no business services, nothing. And no one seems to care either. ALL IN ALL, I travel 2-3 times a month, every month, for business all over the US and this is BY FAR the worst hotel experience I have ever had.

We were looking for a hotel that offered a good location and a great price. Thought that this hotel filled both of those requirements. Sadly it did not. Location is the one thing that you can truly say works in the hotels favor. 54th st, walking distance to shows, central park, lincoln center, well just about everything. Thats it for the good though. Everything else about this hotel should send you running for the hills. First I booked two rooms, one for my wife and I and the other for my adult daughter. Just so you know, the rooms are tiny. You can barely turn around without bumping into something. Anyway, they put us on the 12th floor, all the way on the top. This will come into play later. The first night we were there we had dinner reservations at one of chefs Daniel Boloud's restaurants with a meet and greet set up with the chef. My wife is a huge foodie and was looking foreward to this for weeks. About an hour prior to leaving, I went to check on our daughter. Once in her room we sadly discovered that the door lock had malfunctioned and we were locked into the room. Hard to believe? Apparently commonplace at this establishment. It took well over an hour with two men working on things before the manager on duty finally called his boss and got permission to kick the door in. Bits of door went flying everywhere almost putting my eye out, remember the rooms are tiny. But at least we were free. We missed our special evening with the chef since he could not wait for us. But the hotel did compensate us by giving us a voucher for a free continental breakfast. Very giving of them. Im not sure we would have even gotten another room for my daughter had we not complained. So that was the first night. The second night that we stayed more things happened. Forget the fact that the maid never came to make up our rooms, even though we called the front desk twice to request this. No never mind that. I made the huge mistake of trying to use the inroom safe. Now I have stayed in a lot of hotel rooms, and used the safes, maybe hundreds of times. They have all pretty much been the same kind of safe. Very easy to use if you follow the provided instructions. Well I put my important documents in the safe and started to follow the instructions and it instantly locked as soon as I shut it. The instructions clearly said to shut the door, then punch in your secret code, etc... Lies. Had to call to get them to open it up for me, only they couldnt do it right away and said that sometime in the evening, while we were out at a show, someone would come up and open the safe. Does this even make sence? What is the point of the safe if they are just going to do that? But the evening continues. So we go out to dinner and a show. Get back to the hotel at around 12:30 only to find these nice little pieces of paper taped to the elevator doors stating that the elevators were broken and that management was sorry. Sorry?!? We were on the bloody 12th floor. Climbing up these rickety stairs, with no hand rails mind you, with all kinds of other people. Some elderly people too. It was a mess. Why couldnt we use the service elevator. Come to find out, this had also been broken all along. We did make it back to our room, my wife wanted some ice for some ice water. Guests do not have access to an ice machine on any floor, you need to call their 24 hour room service to get it. But because the elevators werent working they would not answer their phone for room service. So too bad no ice. Just went to bed in our dirty little room. The next morning the elevators were still not working. We asked for a bellman to help with our luggage since we were on the 12th floor and had to carry them all the way down. Again they refused. The front desk person insisted I first check out then go see the bellman for assistance. The bellmans responce was this service was only for guests and since I had allready checked out he could not help me. What a scam. Just tell the truth. You dont want to carry bags down 12 flights of stairs either. Fortunately the elevator cake back on line and we git our bags down without injury. Couldnt get out of there fast enough.

A couple must do things for NYC is Top of the Rock, Walk through Central Park, Ground Zero , save some time and money by doing a bus tour, but start early. Wear comfortable shoes as you will be walking a lot. I also love going to Canal Street and getting cologne/perfume for half price. Knock off designer bags are also available.

Location - Always knew this would be fabulous, this was the main driver for booking our stay here. Booking process - A few of the reviews I read prompted me to email the hotel a week before the stay to ensure our booking was in place as we had originally booked in April via Expedia. I received a speedy response from the hotel advising me that my booking was on their system as requested and that we would be given a renovated room, this was also the case when we got there... I love it when a plan comes together! Staff - The front desk were pleasant upon arrival, we did not have much interaction with them as we are very self sufficient, but the one request we did make was for a cup of hot water for medication, which arrived promptly to our room free of charge. - Although we did not drink in the bar, we visited the bar for a bucket of ice as the machine was out of order, if anything this was the only negative experience we had at the hotel, on two occasions the bar man was on the telephone and ignored our presence for a good few minutes before acknowledging us and dealing with our request. - All the door men were very pleasant and happy to help, Jeff in particular deserves a mention, he was very polite and welcoming and looked after our airport shuttle for our departure so that we did not have to worry about it! Room - First and foremost the room was clean and the beds were comfortable, I did not have any issues with noise from other rooms, the construction over the road or the air conditioning unit, as mentioned in other reviews. Although the air-con was on the loud side of the spectrum, it was easy to control and we were able to turn it off if the noise got on our nerves. The room was also a decent size, I am lucky enough to have visited New York previously and after staying in another hotel there I can confirm that this room was the average, if not quite large for the city. The room was equipped with a flat screen TV (good for catching up on US TV shows and the weather channel) and there was an iPhone dock. The bathroom was spacious with a nice shower and plenty of hot water. I guess the only box that was not ticked was the tea and coffee making facilities, but this was not an issue as there is a Starbucks over the road. There are no doubts that there are improvements that could be made to this hotel, in particular the windows were a little drafty (the window in the bathroom had a half inch gap at the top) but with temperatures in the 70s and 80s and the thick curtains this was not an issue. Also little things, like the ice machine being out of order (which it seems to have been for some time) and the coffee and tea making facilities, would make a big difference.

My daughter and I stayed at this Hotel for four nights and unfortunately our stay coincided with Hurricane Irene, and the Mayor\u2018s sensationalizing it by shutting down subways, airports and restaurants long after it was obvious that Irene would not pose any serious threat to the City. However, because of the excellent location of this hotel, we had easy access to 24-hour food through nearby family-run stores that remained open even after the entire City was shut down. The overall friendliness, cooperation and courtesy of the staff at Ameritania made us feel comfortable there. At the time Ameritania was still under construction. So there were some deficiencies in several areas. For example, we had a room on the 12th floor, which was renovated but had a non-functioning phone system that remained disconnected during our entire stay. So we had to go down to the front desk with any housekeeping requests, which were responded to in a timely manner. Secondly, at the time of our reservation we had requested a room with a double bed but got one with one queen -size bed because of unavailability. Ameritania offered us a free roll-over bed instead, which I found being not as comfortable as a regular bed at all. On the evening of our fourth day at Ameritania, my daughter noticed something moving in a plastic bag containing a bag of Hershey\u2019s Chocolate Kisses I had bought the previous day. As I approached the bag, I noticed a mouse trapped in that bag. I immediately tied up the bag closed and delivered that live mouse to the front desk. The following day, two men came into the room searching for holes in walls allowing a mouse to come into our room. They found one underneath the air conditioner just below the window. Because we were leaving Ameritania that day, I asked them to fix the hole later after we had left. I think that mouse downgraded my daughter\u2019s evaluation of the hotel substantially. But I cannot blame Amertania for this mouse as I have learned New York City has a rampant mice problem. Instead I would like to invite the City\u2019s Mayor to consider solving this mice problem, which poses a real public health hazard, instead of sensationalizing hurricanes, causing all sorts of problems for tourists, and trying to speak terribly broken Spanish in an attempt to attract the Hispanic voters.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, \"OK\" hotel\u201d", "Author": "Guysingle", "ReviewID": "UR117439452", "Content": "We had a refurbished room here.

The three nights that my partner and I stayed at this hotel were pretty disastrous! I made a reservation with this place through Last Minute Travel, I got what I thought was a pretty good deal for the three nights that we were going to stay there, boy was I wrong! Upon checking in on August 8th, my partner and I were informed that the hotel would be docking our card an additional $90 on top of the $590 that we already paid. They ended up running us through some BS about how in a few weeks or so we\u2019d get that money back, and, they HAD to have it right then. So, reluctantly we gave them the money. They had us staying in room 1010, they informed us that construction was still going on, on the hotel and such, which didn\u2019t really bother us. We ended up taking the elevator to our room, which was hot, dirty and extremely slow! Upon getting to our room, we discovered that we one of the newer renovated rooms. The room itself was small, the bed was nice and clean but very freaking dangerous, there was a huge mirror up against the wall that took up tons of space, the view sucked as our room was located directly across from the construction going on outside, the bathroom was nice and clean but again very small. The room was pretty average to say the least. The bed is one of those modern type ones that set really low to the ground. It wasn\u2019t five minutes of being in the room that I smashed my foot up against it and broke it, my foot that is. I ended up going down to the front desk and filling out an incident report about it, I was offered ice as medical treatment and informed that a manager would contact me ASAP about it. The manager never called. I spent the next four days walking around with a broke foot. As if that weren\u2019t bad enough, during our stay, housekeeping thought it would be a good idea to come and take all of our towels, washcloths etc. and not leave any fresh ones AND the hotel turned off our water. Broke foot and all I had to limp down to the front desk and tell them about it, only to have them say, \u201cWe forgot to mention that the workers turned it off. It should be back on now!\u201d When the water was eventually turned back on, it was brown with sediment parts in it. Totally gross. Also, the hot water took forever to heat up. When it finally came time to check out, I still hadn\u2019t heard from a manager about my foot or anything and the hotel charged us an additional $46 to take us to the airport. We wanted to take a cab, which would have been about $30 or so. When I finally got back home I called the hotel and complained about everything.

I requested early check-in and a renovated room, as most people have suggested. The early check-in was a no-can-do, because apparently they were booked full, so we just hung out a little until their check out time. They were polite enough to let us in at 10, an hour earlier than expected, which was good because we flew in at 5 in the morning with no sleep. At first, they were going to give us a room with only ONE bed, for FOUR people, and after complaining how we were GUARANTEED 2 doubles by phone and online, they fixed it. We had a corner room, which i believe was slightly bigger than the other rooms, but still tiny... but since this is our first time in NYC, i can't tell if it's small compared to other hotels... I believe that we had a renovated room... at least we were on a floor where they were renovating the rooms around ours. I didn't hear anything at all, morning or night. The room itself, was quite average- not clean, but not dreadfully disgusting. The restroom was TINY. I had to sit slanted while using the toilet because it was so close to the door, and i'm short (5'2). The view was... oh wait there was NO VIEW. There was a brick wall from the other building. The Continental Breakfast is a HUGE rip off! $10 for a few pieces of bagels and fruits... walk down the street to starbucks or mcdonalds for some DECENT food. The location, i'll have to admit was good. Right next to Broadway and a few streets from Times Square, Central Park, and subways. Oh and the elevators sucked... there are only 2, and they take FOREVER to get up on my floor (4). The workers use them also, so the elevator on the left is not as new and clean as the one on the right. Sometimes at night, you can hear the bar next door, at least for the rooms facing that way, but it really didn't bother me that much. I was too tired to let noise bother my sleep, and anyways, i'm a heavy sleeper. So all-in-all, not an AMAZING hotel, but it wasn't DREADFUL either. 2 1/2 stars for it's location and attempt to be hospitable.

We were placed in room 603, on arrival late in the evening, to find the sheets were clearly not changed but simply straightened out, after a previous user. They were obviously and significantly soiled in a number of places with what appeared to be body fluids, including possibly blood. I was prompted by this to immediately strip the bed and examine matters better. The undersheet was heavily stained, on one side, just like in a bed in a geriatric long-stay unit with incontinent patients, and the mattress itself showed signs of multiple previous incidents, although then quite dry. 2. I immediately reported the matter to the reception desk by phone and politely asked for fresh linen and a change of under-sheet and mattress. The reception representative was hostile and overtly aggressive. Mr. \"Hose'\"? said clean sheets were not available at that hour and after two reminder calls and a significant delay of more than forty minutes, for two tired transatlantic travellers, offered us an alternative room. I inspected this offered alternative with a polite porter who was clearly embarrassed but not un-used to the scene. I found that the second choice room offered was a clearly sub-standard, tiny room, on first floor, directly over an open construction site with a third of the window taken up with a noisy air-con unit. I had to decline. Mr. Hose' then offered two other alternatives that I will just say were similarly aesthetically less convenient that our original room, so we opted to stay in 603 insisting, at least, on a change of all bed linen. 3. Mr. Hose at this stage menacingly suggested that we could always \"move out if you are not happy \", despite the late hour, our correct booking and obvious absence of an alternative at that hour of the night. 4. Eventually a lady arrived with a change of sheets which were un-ironed. She explained that the hotel laundry service did not iron sheets, as their iron had been broken for some months and that the replacement sheets were the cleanest available. Throughout our stay, after this worrying introduction to their hygiene practices, I asked for a daily change, as we were sweating a lot with humidity and could not sleep with the noise of the air con in our room. The sheets provided each day were never ironed and frequently raised questions re cleaning standards. This should worry anyone connected with hygiene standards in a city with a recent history of a major bed bug epidemic. It clearly does not worry the management of this \"hotel\". 5. The lift on the left, from lobby to floors, had a carpet flooring that had frayed and shifted considerably, exposing areas of the metal floor and giving the impression of a generally un-safe and un-clean environment. It may not be contrary to hygiene regs. but it certainly matches their courtesy standards. 6. The hotel is under-going repairs and builders and dust are all over the place. The poor quality of the tile-work in the bathroom of room 603 hints that the workers involved probably operate to similar standards as the reception staff. Again, probably not covered by the regulations, but someone should be interested in the poor image this company are providing of hotel standards in one of the most interesting cities in the world.\" Anyone can make a mistake, but this \"hotel\" obviously does not care what transient travellers think, as long as they can exploit and bully them.

We chose the Ameritania based on location, price and the ability to reserve a \"quad\" room (ie 2 double beds) - as two friends travelling together rather than a couple, we specifically wanted a quad room. We arrived very late at night and were told by the desk clerk that no quad room was available and that we had been booked into a king room instead. We pointed out that we had specifically reserved a quad room and this was met with a shrug and a comment that the king room was the same price (this wasn't the point at all). We were told that the hotel would move us into a quad room next day. As it was late at night we had little choice but to accept the position. The room we were put in was small, dark, appeared to be unfinished (the whole of the second floor appeared to be being renovated) and did not seem clean, and we were glad it was only for one night. The next morning we packed up as instructed. Obviously it was inconvenient - we had to carry possessions rather than leave them in the room and it is not relaxing to have to pack after 1 night. But we were glad to be changing to a different room. We went down to the front desk where the attendant confirmed we could be moved to a quad room. The attendant could not confirm which room - which surprised us given the hotel must know who is checking out. But we felt confident our request was understood. When we returned that evening, we were given keys to the new room. This was a much, much nicer room - larger, brighter and clean. But it was not a quad room - another king room. We also noted that the safe didn't work, the air conditioning did not seem to be effective and the room phone did not work. We went down to reception to question this. We were told (again) that there was no quad room available. We were told that the notes for our removal said \"move to higher floor with view\". We can only assume that our request was confused with someone else's request. The attendant said that we could be moved again the next day to a quad room. However, by this time, we simply were not inclined to believe the assurances. Plus we did not want the inconvenience of packing up and being moved again. We were also concerned that any new room might be dingy and dark along the lines of our initial room. We therefore agreed to stay in this room provided the other issues could be fixed. An engineer arrived promptly and fixed the safe. The air conditioning was improved - though never ideal - and we were told the phone line had been cut and could not be repaired. Despite this, we felt the best option was to stay in this room. During the rest of the stay, things improved and there were no further major problems. However, despite repeated requests, we never managed to obtain a full set of towels -a relatively minor problem but still inconvenient. We felt generally that the staff were unsympathetic to our issues - we barely received an apology let alone any offer to make up for the inconvenience.

If you don\u2019t feel like reading this entire review then the only thing you really need to know is that I would not recommend this hotel to anyone because we found a mouse in our room. Also, even if the mouse issue was taken care of, I still would not recommend this hotel to anyone based on the terrible customer service we received from the Assistant Front Desk Supervisor regarding this issue. My wife and I had booked and pre-paid for this hotel through Book-it.com for 6 nights in late May 2011. The hotel was listed on the website as 3 stars and was going for an average of $140 plus tax per night. Like many similar websites the identity of the hotel was only revealed to us after confirming the booking. We decided to take our chance considering the price was so affordable compared to other accommodations in New York City. The location was also great (Theatre district \u2013 next to Ed Sullivan Theatre, walking distance from Times Square and Central Park) and we figured if it was listed as a three star hotel it couldn\u2019t be too bad. Some of our friends had also used the same website to book a \u201cmystery hotel\u201d in New York, through which they were also booked at the Ameritania, and had no problems - they said it wasn\u2019t the greatest hotel but for only 6 nights and considering we probably wouldn\u2019t be spending too much time in the room it was good enough. We didn\u2019t have very high expectations for this hotel. These expectations went even lower after we read some of the reviews, however, the price was right and we were willing to put up with a less than ideal place for a few nights. We can put up with a lot\u2026our main concern was cleanliness, mainly that there were no bed bugs. Upon arriving at the hotel I could see that the lobby and lounge area had been renovated fairly recently. It looked decent but we knew that this wouldn\u2019t be an accurate reflection of the rest of the hotel based on the reviews that we had read. We were booked in room 215. Of course the room hadn\u2019t been renovated yet, which explains the cheap price. On one hand I expected that we would be getting a room that hadn\u2019t been renovated yet but based on the hotel management\u2019s response to other customer\u2019s complaints on this website (that renovations should be complete by May 2011) I had some hope that we would get a newly renovated room. Unfortunately, from what it looked like the renovations at this hotel wouldn\u2019t be done for some time. It looked as though our entire floor still needed to be re-done\u2026there were rooms with the doors left open that were completely gutted, construction material lying around, etc. I never actually saw any other guests on our floor (although I did see some contractors walking around) and it was eerily quiet which made me think we were the only ones staying on the floor. Who knows how many other floors were like this. The room wasn\u2019t great which wasn\u2019t a surprise. It was small (which we didn\u2019t mind) and dark (which we also didn\u2019t mind except for it made it hard to see if the room was cleaned properly). The first thing we did was check the mattress for any signs of bed bugs \u2026thankfully we didn\u2019t find anything. The floor looked like it hadn\u2019t been vacuumed recently, the washroom stunk, and the bathtub had some hairs in it. The water pressure and temperature for the shower wasn\u2019t consistent. Still, as we had low expectations anyways we were content with making this our home for 6 nights. It wasn\u2019t until night number 4 that we had our encounter with the mouse. It was about 2 in the morning when my wife had heard some rustling in the garbage can and saw the mouse poke its head out. I saw it running along the wall towards the corner of the room. There are a lot of things that we are willing to put up with but having rodents running around our room is not one of them\u2026 I called the front desk to report the problem. At this point I was still willing to stay at Ameritania if they offered me a renovated room as we wanted to spare ourselves the inconvenience of having to move hotels in the middle of the night. The maintenance guy came up to our room and as he wasn\u2019t acting surprised I figured this was a problem that he had seen before although he was adamant that he had never received any such complaints. The only other room that was available was another unfinished room directly above ours. I checked it out and it looked a little better but we didn\u2019t take it. Front desk set up another hotel for us (Sheraton Tribeca). The Sheraton was great but it wasn\u2019t as central and cost $330 plus tax per night. The front desk staff at Sheraton said that they had a few other guests from Ameritania transfer to Sheraton earlier in the night. The front desk guy working the late shift at Ameritania the night we checked out was fine to deal with. He was nice and seemed like he genuinely felt bad that we had to move hotels in the middle of the night. He was also the one who called around to see what other hotels were available. Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t deal with our refund and told us to contact the manager the next day stating that management wouldn\u2019t be in until 3 in the afternoon. We were told that management would be advised of our issue. The following afternoon we went back to the hotel to speak with the Assistant Front Desk Supervisor. The supervisor wasn\u2019t yet aware of our problem, which surprised me as I figured the issue would be a priority for management to deal with although, to be fair, he had just started his shift shortly before we arrived. When I explained my problem to him he initially told me that he didn\u2019t have the authority to give me a refund and told me I had to speak to the Hotel Manager. I was disappointed that he wasn\u2019t more willing to help out\u2026I thought that, as a supervisor, he would make every effort to properly address a customer complaint, especially one such as this. After speaking with him for some time he finally said that he could approve a refund...which still wasn\u2019t good enough as he said that he would only refund us for 1 and a half nights. Again he claimed that I would have to speak with the hotel manager who, of course, wouldn\u2019t be in for a few more days and who he had no way to contact. Again, after some time he reluctantly agreed to charge for only 2 nights. He stated that we would have to contact bookit.com for the refund and only did so himself when I asked him to. I was content with this outcome although I was not happy with how long it took before he agreed to give a refund for more than 1 and a half days. Regardless of how cheap the price is and regardless of the prime location do not stay at this hotel. Even after the renovations are complete and the mouse problem is fixed I still wouldn\u2019t stay here based on the terrible customer service from the supervisor.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExceeded Expectations and would return again\u201d", "Author": "nataliem9", "ReviewID": "UR114721007", "Content": "After reading various mixed reviews of this hotel before we went away, i was apprehensive at what we might find upon our arrival.

The attention to detail, or lack thereof, is going to really hold this hotel back. For instance, I had issues with the key card system every time I left the room. Nothing is more frustrating after a 16 hour day than finally getting to your room and finding out you can't get in. This happened four times during a one night stay until they finally called the engineer to fix it. I then found out that the key card system is from 1988 and is a constant source of problems. If this is true, management needs to replace it pronto! Once I got into my room, there were no towels and it took 3 tries to finally get them. Once i did get them, they were still damp. Perhaps they have a towel shortage too? The room has a huge flat panel TV, just don't try to watch it unless you like watching snow. I pulled the wires out and tightened everything down, but to no avail. Also, the shower is lukewarm. Other than that, the bed is comfy and the a/c works great. As I said, everything has been re-modeled and updated. The room is small, so if you're a family that spends time at the buffet tables, you will not be too comfortable in a standard room. Location is also superb. It feels like a quiet pocket right near the theatre district and the craziness of Broadway.

Carpet was old, stained & had huge folds in it; closet door couldn't be shut because of a huge fold in front of it. There were holes in the ceiling, & between the wall and top of window ledge with cracked plaster or sheet-rock. The closet ceiling was falling in and moldy. The wall between the toilet and shower was also water damaged and looked moldy. The floor in front of the heater/AC collapsed down when you stepped on it. Room was so small -about 12 inches between bed & heater & could only fit 1 nightstand. Second nightstand was at foot of bed and the drawers wouldn't stay shut; I'd have to hold the drawers closed with my hand to pass by it to get into the miniscule bathroom. Bathroom had a new sink & toilet and flooring, but the sink hung over the toilet by about 10 inches so you had to sit on the side edge of the toilet and the sink still pressed into your arm. I was so embarassed for all visitors (hotel had many international guests) that I ended up by apologizing to everyone I rode on the elevator with - telling them that hotels in the US and NY are not like this; several people told me they were happy to hear that because they were horrified at the place. YES, the lobby and bar area look lovely.... the rest of this place (I was on 3 different floors) should be condemmed!", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot pleasant!\u201d", "Author": "Hallsworth24", "ReviewID": "UR90465354", "Content": "Brilliant location as it is walking distance to Times Square etc and central park, however it is also across from a building site and got scaffolding erected.

Rooms on the \"smoking\" floor reek of smoke, so if you're a non-smoker don't go there! The non-smoking room I had was about 10 x 9 (Queen size bed) + full bathroom, so smallish but adequate. The bedroom and bathroom were clean, the drawers were clean - there was a pile of plaster dust in the corner behind the TV cabinet which remained there for my entire stay. No bed bugs found. The TV is not the sleekest, but fine. There is no minibar or tea/coffee making facilities in the room. There is an ironing board and iron, safe and luggage stand. Hairdryer in the bathroom. Toiletires and towels were supplied and replaced as needed - and absolutely fine. The bed and the linens were fine, plenty of choice of pillows. I found the room a little chilly and no extra blankets in the wardrobe. Could do with more light in the bedroom and at least one mirror in the bedroom itself. The lifts are slow especially around 9 to 9.30am. The building opposite (on 54th) is being demolished so noise starts at 7.00am. The garbage truck crashes and bangs its way down the road in the small hours, but it's NYC. The decor is plastic and a bit cheesey.....but, it's a budget priced hotel and you come to see the City not to critique the interior design. Reception and door staff were friendly and helped with luggage and small requests. There is a parking garage and a Gold's Gym in the same street. There's a good snack/juice/deli bar at the corner of 54th/8th. You can get a 20% discount card at the reception desk for breakfast at Serena which is diagonally opposite on Broadway - the Continental breakfast is pretty good value @ $14. I didn't breakfast at the Ameritania....it didn't look particularly inviting. I wouldn't have wanted to spend much time in my room, but I wanted a budget priced hotel that was clean and reasonably comfortable whilst I enjoyed going out and about in NYC - so with those critieria, I was quite satisfied.

We tried to call the front desk & the phone did not work. We promptly went downstairs & asked for a different room. We were given a room on the 2nd floor. The sink was slanted so the soap would not stay on the edge, water from the shower splashed everywhere because the only barrier is a plate of glass that goes half the width of the tub, no adjustment for air/heat, water barely came out of the shower head, the matresses were horrible, it smelled like someone was smoking in the bathroom off & on & someone was playing a trumped off & on all night. The next day we asked for a different room & were moved to the 9th floor. The room was still dim but was larger. The window had gaps in different spots around the frame so we heard street noise all night & again the mattress was horrible. The other problem was that the tub drained VERY slowly. Bottom line, if you stay here, BE PREPARED & complain if the room is not good. The staff were apologetic but there is only so much they can do when the building is old, run down & falling apart.

Price: The price was cheap for NY. I dont think we paid more than AUD$160. But we also booked few months in advance, and it was non refundable. I should note - at the time, the Australian dollar was about 60 cents to the US dollar. So accommodation prices were SUPER expensive for your average Aussie. Room: The room is small and just enough to move. This is New York - we didnt expect much space. The lighting is dim. We struggled to fit 4 suitcases in there. The decor was dim and dark coloured. The windows opened but with great difficulty. Our room faced the street but we were above the 4th floor and avoided any traffic noises. Our boiler/heating seems to break down every 2nd night. We constantly called maintenance to come into our room to check it. But of course, he kept assuring us that it was working fine. There were at least 2 nights we woke up completely cold - and we all went to sleep in our coats, beanies, scarves (it was snowing on the street outside). The rooms were clean and the beds were made every day. We found we had to take the toilet roll off the holder for them to replace it every so often. We were unsure of how the tipping system worked for housekeeping - but we did eventually leave a \"thank you\" note and a tip for housekeeping - our beds/linen were changed with greater efficiency and neatness. The carpets were a bit shoddy looking, but because they were a dark colour, I must admit most of the grot on the floor escaped my notice. Just make sure you bring a spare pair of thongs with you to avoid the grot on the floor. We did a lot of shopping in NY and left tons and tons of paper bags and boxes for housekeeping to dispose of - and they did it efficiently every day. Bathroom: The bathroom was neat and tidy. Soaps, shampoos and towels were replaced every day. I found the bathroom small, and a bit dated, but again, I didnt expect much space in New York and for the price we paid. Service: New York is all about the money - the more tips we gave, the better the service. We ordered books and electronics from amazon.com and had them delivered to the hotel. They promptly delivered it to our room without any issue. I found the front desk staff was nice and willing to listen to our complaints about the heating in our room - they always sent someone up as quickly as they could. Location: The location was FANTASTIC. We were right above the Late Night with David Letterman show. The subway was close by and easy enough to go uptown or downtown. Time Square opened late every night and it was only about 10-15 minute walk. I found the area rather safe - its a good location. All of us girls felt safe walking late at night on the street. Overall: We really only used the hotel for sleeping, showering, a quick change of clothes before we left to roam New York once more. New York has so much to offer for entertainment, the small stuff with accomodation seems to be an afterthought. I guess we weren't in our room long enough to nit pick the small stuff. I was happy with Ameritana - the staff was nice, and if you want a budget place for sleeping and showering only, then the location of this place is fantastic and for an affordable price.", "Date": "December 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "PA", "Title": "\u201cHorrid, filthy, wet dark rooms and water\u201d", "Author": "Chrostalk", "ReviewID": "UR50959130", "Content": "We were there for one night, and it truly was the night from H#*L. We were in a room with a damp rug, and sloped floor beneath it. Water damage evidenced in the hallways. There was not one lightbulb higher than 25 watts. I am not exaggerating.When we asked for help with lighting, there was no solution to be given. Lights had wire baskets over them in the bathroom so it could not be changed by the guest. We could barely see to use the bath. The WATER.....tub and sink water cam out brown. We were advised to run it for 15 minutes before using. What???!!! GIve me a break! It was awful . The tub would not drain, it took over 15 minutes for thee water to leave. It also left behind dead flies. Gruesome. We asked for bottled water to be brought to us for us to use to brush our teeth. We were sent one bottle with their compliments, lol. We were in a bind because we were there to see a family member perform, and had to leave for the show. We would have run in the other direction if we could have. When we arrived back at about midnight, the room was like ice. There was no heat at all. Management took us to another room from hell...this time half the size, and with a full sized bed only. Again no heat. We were brought a space heater, very grubby, to assist us because there was no other room to again shift us over to. We were exhausted, having been traveling since 5 the previous morning. When we tried the heater, it was ALSO non functional! You just cannot make this stuff up!!!!! We decided to stay only due to sheer exhaustion. Which was also the reason I am ssure I could fall asleep that night. This room, however had a bathroom that was lit well, and had clean water. It was on the same floor as the first. It was their smallest room. The rug was filthy, Please do not even think of this place.

I must say unlike some we did not have a small room it was large enough for 2 double beds, wardrobe space, tv unit, safe and desk. My friend smokes so we had a smoking room on the 3rd floor, which was a it smelly but then I'm a non smoker. The room was very noisy, there seemed to be a permanent generator running outside the window a constant smell of chinese food. All in all this hotel is absolutely fine if all you need is somewhere to crash and a fantastic location. What else do you need in New York if you're on a budget?! The staff were great, the bar was good and the room was clean. However, if this was a romantic weekend booking then I would think again, I would not stay here with my husband.", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGood Location, Good Hotel\u201d", "Author": "gloeire", "ReviewID": "UR38568759", "Content": "The hotel was good, travelled with husband & friends.

Post-modern deco that was more Sanderson than Hilton. Our initial thought was, we bagged a bargain. Unfortunately though, with this hotel, beauty was skin-deep. The rooms that we were assigned to were done-up in a manner akin to a shoddy botox job. Squirts of modern touch, did not do enough to conceal its underlying shabbiness. Peeling wallpapers, blinds that would not stay up, toilets that do not flush well. The safe, which sat under the old fashioned tube telly, had four exposed AA batteries adorning the thick steel door. We ended up locking our valuables in our suitcase as we weren't sure that it's safe to store our things in a safe that has exposed electronic circuitry. Better a canvas bag than risk our valuables locked away for good in a steel safe! During our stay, one of the two lifts broke down. Rush hour was especially bad as we had to wait up to 10 minutes at a time to get from our floor to the lobby. Going down the stairs is an option, but with a stroller and kid in tow, not a practical one. On the subject of kids, if you are travelling with one, this is definitely not the hotel for you - unless you are in the habit of travelling with a kettle. There is no restaurant in house nor was the bar ever open for us to fill up our flask with hot water. When asked about the kettle-less hotel, all the staff could offer was, \"Bring the bottle of milk downstairs and the houseman can heat it up with a microwave\". In the end, we got into the routine of filling up our flask twice daily at the ever-friendly Starbucks across the road. We are not spoilt travelers as we have stayed in physically shabbier hotels. But on these occassion the hotels first of all, do not try to sell itself as something it aspires to, rather than what it really is. Secondly, we have somehow been somewhat lucky that the shabby hotels we've stayed in are manned by friendly staff. Unfortunately, the staff at Ameritania, were curt. During check-in we were not greeted by the receptionists with the usual pleasantries as one would expect at hotels. In Japan, they would lose their jobs to Aibo the robot - cold and emotionless. Upon returning our room keys, I waited for the receptionist to say that all is well and done. But all I got was, \"Is there anything else you need?\"... I bid my farewell for the first and last time.

There are two lifts of which one was broken during our stay which was a real pain for the duration of our stay. The general up keep of the building is very very poor. Paint work and wall paper dirty and peeling while the carpet looks well past its sell by date. The room itself as many other people have said is very dark. in fact the main light in the room is pointless as there are two wall lights which give more light. The room was very dim and was added to by the fact that everything in the room is a dark colour. The carpet was in poor condition and smelt old and stale. The bathroom was atleast clean although the bath was tiny. The room was generally small and dingy and to be honest quite depressing. I have heard other horror stories of no hot water,broken windows and lack of air con. We had none of these problems, although I was given the tip to ask for a room higher up to avoid the noise from the street below.

If your a light sleeper, as many reviews have said, ask for a room without a view. We asked for a non smoking room and when we opened the door we were hit with the stench of stale smoke & cigarette butts had been thrown out onto the balcony - so it was def not a non smoking room. I couldn't be bothered complaining about it as our room was actually quite nice compared to other pics of rooms I'd seen on here so we just sprayed the room with copious amounts of deodorant/perfume & opened the windows - which was fine cuz the room was roasting anyway. Couldn't get the smell away from the bathroom tho even after 3 days! On the day we left there were 2 women checking in & the man at reception asked if they wanted smoking or non smoking & when they asked about best rooms he said it didn't really matter - obviously smokings allowed in every room then they'l just take the ashtray out & say its non smoking! Sorry I know i've gone on about this a bit but i HATE the smell of smoke! Only other bug bear was the tea/coffee making facilities which were meant to be complimentary had an out of order sign on the whole time & I saw one of the cleaners using it to fill up his bucket! And the staff at reception were ok but not the most forthcoming - I didn't feel like I could ask them anything without being a pain. Doormen on the other hand were fab. When you step out the hotel you are literally 5 mins from times sq, 10 from central park and it really is the best location! The tag line for the hotel chain was, budget accommodation in the best locations & this was def true! New York is an amazing place, we were totally shattered by the end of the 4 days but we managed to do everything we wanted so really, the hotel didn't matter. We were on a budget, so this was ok for us, but if you can afford it, pay a bit more. We went to see the sights of New York not spend 4 days in a hotel room. We had a fantastic time in New York but the hotel wasn't the best. Tip - go to Ellens stardust Diner for breakfast, lunch or Dinner - it was so fun & really woke us up in the Morning! Also Famous Famiglia Pizza, I know its a chain but the pizza is AMAZING!!!! And I'd recommend top of the rock as opposed to Empire State for a view. Oh and Godiva - AMAZING chocolate covered strawberries - expensive but sooooo good!

I had previously read some negative reviews, however they mainly seem to have a problem with the size of the rooms and the lighting. I honestly couldn't give a rats *bottom* how big the room is, you're at the hotel to sleep and as long as there's a bed in there I'd be happy! *THE ROOM* I was pleasantly surprised. My room (1122) was higher up and did not have the excellent view afforded some rooms, I requested this as I'm a light sleeper and the receptionist said \"it's either a view or quiet, you can't have both\" I'll stick a picture up of my view, overlooking other rooms. I was happy with this as the room was, as promised, blissfully quiet. The room was a decent size, including a television with 30-odd free channels (including NY1, Which has the temperature displayed permanently - handy) a safe to store valuables, Powerful shower in the bathroom with complimentary shower gels, shower cap etc, and a writing desk with a lamp. The rooms ARE dingy, but if you put the main light on along with both bedside ones and the one on the writing desk, there's enough light. The air conditioning unit was loud but pumped out plenty of cool air, a must as the rooms are heated more than I was comfortable with. The windows open too which is a bonus. An ice bucket was provided: I stuck loads of ice in this from the ice machine on our floor and used it as a fridge! The room was cleaned to a high standard daily. The room was clean when we arrived. The corridor carpet appeared stained, like it was damp, and a trip to the ice machine in stockinged feet confirmed that areas were wet! No idea why this is, but just wear shoes and you'll be fine. The room was not wet or damp in any way. I managed to block the toilet (!) and a quick call to reception, a handyman came five minutes later and unblocked it. A couple we arrived with had a couple of issues with their room; the air conditiong didn't appear to be working for one. I have no issues at all with the room, I thought for the price it was excellent! Staff were helpful at all times. *HOTEL* The bar is no longer open, this isn't really an issue as there are two good bars right next door, or plenty more in times square and surrounding area. It can be expensive though around this area, especially if you are travelling from Britain, as the pound is so weak against the dollar compared to what it was (1.35dollars to the pound when we went!) I'd recommend Greenwhich village for a good night out at cheaper prices, more studenty = cheaper!! and better atmosphere, less touristy. But I digress... *LOCATION* The hotel is in a fantastic location: right in the heart of the action. You have the following within a ten minute walk: the empire state building, Central park, FAO Schwartz toy store, Radio city music hall, Fifth avenue Times square and all the broadway shows. The rockefeller centre, macy's and most other things are just a little further. You can see times square lit up like a beacon as soon as you leave the hotel! It's also right next to the Late show with David Letterman, unfortunately they were not filming on the days we tried for tickets, But I'd recommend you do so if you have more than 4 days there. You can do the main touristy stuff in a long weekend, if you don't mind walking! *SUMMARY* so in summary then, I'd have to give this hotel 8 out of ten. The location is one of the best, my room was clean, a good size, and had everything i needed. The staff were helpful. Everything worked. It was cleaned daily. The door staff would help you hail a cab any time. If you want the best location and don't want to pay top dollar, this is your hotel! ignore those moaning about trivial things - remember you'll only be at the hotel to sleep and shower! I would definately stay again. *TIPS* get your essentials from the DUANE READE stores, they are all over and far cheaper than elswhere. You can use most cards over there, my HSBC one was 2.5% up to five dollars for withdrawing money: that would have been better value than using the post office to get your dollars, and you wouldn't have to lug it around at the airport either. I'd just take my card next time with hindsight. Take out a bus tour, I'd recommend City sights NY. it's $80 for their complete bus ticket, that includes the uptown and downtown Manhattan tour, Brooklyn tour, Brooklyn at night tour (unparalleled views of brooklyn bridge and Manhattan at night) ferry around manhattan cruise, Entry to either the ESB or top of the rock observatory and a Statue of liberty and Ellis island immigration museum tour. By far the best way to view manhattan, the guides are knowledgeable and you can use the bus like a taxi service to any destination! Hope this doesn't look like complete waffle and comes in handy to someone! if anyone has any questions for a brit that's just returned from Manhattan, feel free to contact me.

The Hotel is small, contempory and clean. What more can you ask for when you are never in your hotel anyway? We arrived to be greated by friendly staff and shown to our room by the porter. Our room was small but clean, we wouldnt have wanted it any bigger. The bathroom was small too but clean and adaquate for what we needed. There was enough room to put our clothes away in the wardrobes and draws and a desk for all our bits and peices. The bed was comfy and the sheets were changed every day. The only problem we had was that the heater was on full blast and we couldnt turn it down, we never complained about it as it was Janaury and I would much rather it be hot than cold, we just opened the window a little while we were out. It was noisy on a night but you cannot complain as the location was fantastic. The bar was really nice in the hotel too, the staff were friendly however it did get quite busy. We know a few people who have been to NY and stayed in a worse hotel and been miles out of the city. When you step out of the Ameritania you are on Broadway, 5 minutes stroll to Time Square, 5 minutes to the bottom of central park, 10 minutes from Rockafella and Empire state which is nothing!

There was no space to walk on either side of the bed it was so small. The TV was so old and basic channels didn't even come in. We had a choice of about 8 channels total! The bathroom was so cramped you couldn't sit on the toilet without banging your knees against that wall - you had to sit diagonally. The water was really hot - that was about the best thing in the room! The hotel was heated by old school radiators.

And it was lovely to come home every evening to a nice cup of free coffee / tea / herbal tea in the resident's bar (no longer actually a bar). The room is a bit run-down, but it's comfy and relaxing. A tip: stroll down to a theatre (there are so many to choose from) about half an hour before a show and see if you can get tickets. We were really lucky with this and saw an incredible play for next to nothing.

The hotel has no bar now but has a good lounge with very good coffee and various teas on offer 24 hours for free. The porters and staff were very helpful and good to us. I would have liked one strong light for makeup but otherwise I agree with soft lighting as it is much more eco friendly. I thought the bedroom and corridors were OK and sufficiently well lit always. I would much rather pay for a good location than fancy wallpaper etc. After all, you will not have to bother about getting taxis and we bought a Metro card for a week and used it to get to the rest of Manhattan .

For $269.44 - an online bargain price, by the way - you don\u2019t get much in NYC nowadays, and this joint is living proof of that. Not that it was miserable, or dingy, or tremendously unpleasant...it\u2019s just that in terms of decor, hospitality, and amenities, the Ameritania has all the charm of the finest state-run hotel in Minsk circa 1972. My room was laughably small, even by New York standards. The mildly- saggy queen platform bed not only dominated the room, it WAS the entire room. You had to crabwalk around it. If you got up on one side, you\u2019d trip over the door of the woefully-undersized room safe; if you got up on the other, you\u2019d immediately walk into a wall. There was no room for a desk, which is fine if you enjoy doing everything - eating, reading, computing - from bed. The only seating alternative was the toilet. My particular window looked up Broadway, the view only partially obstructed by a very large billboard on the debris-filled rooftop across the street (see photo). I imagine the views on floors 7 and below would be progressively less interesting. In the window was a cheap, dinky little air-conditioner, the kind you see on sale at discount drug stores for $79. Heat, were it necessary, would likely come from the little radiator stuffed into the corner. 54th Street and Broadway is a mixed blessing of a location. On one hand, you\u2019re right up the street from Times Square, near to buses and subways and convenience stores and ATM\u2019s and a thousand souvenir shops and restaurants in which no respectable New Yorker would be caught dead. On the downside, the parade of honking taxis barreling down Broadway begins at dawn and only subsides after midnight, replaced by the rumbling of ominously large trucks throughout the wee hours. The bathroom was clean and functional, although the slippery plastic tub was an accident waiting to happen. One thing about my room so intrigued me I just had to take a snapshot. The microscopic afterthought of a \u201ccloset\u201d was so tiny that the hangers were too close to the wall to hang straight (see photo). In my several decades of hotel stays, this was a first. I didn\u2019t explore the hotel\u2019s other features, if there were any, although I have to admit being mildly impressed by the plastic/fantastic lounge/bar area, which looked like a set built for the Austin Powers movies, except maybe less comfortable. In summation, the Ameritania is outclassed by most of the hotels in its neighborhood, but it\u2019s not dreadful. If you just need a place to crash after a hectic business day or a night on the town, and you can score a decent price, then this may be it. If you\u2019re looking for amenities, pampering, or a romantic getaway, keep looking. PS: I have stayed here before, in one of the larger single king rooms, and it wasn\u2019t all that bad.

We chose the Ameritania Hotel because it was value for money and it was located not far from the main attractions in New york itself. The hotel review on the British Airways Holidays website looked promising with its elegant pictures and descriptions of the hotel. We went ahead and booked it, costing us \u00a3316.00 for the four day duration stay at the hotel. It was only after we had booked it, we came across the Trip Advisor website and began reading the reviews of people who had recently visited and stayed at the Ameritania Hotel. Majority of the reviews we read about this hotel were not very promising and otherwise very negative. We took our chances and arrived at the hotel, the door staff were friendly they helped us take our our luggage from the reception to our room. Reception staff were friendly and we were checked in quickly and effieciently and our room was ready for us to use, even tho some website state the room wont be available til 1500 hours. The lifts in this hotel are very slow, so i suggest you ask for a room on a lower level, then again if the room is on the Broadway side then expect it to be very noisy at night times as the Broadway can be very busy until the early hours of the morning. when we booked the hotel we requested a room with two bed which we got, so no real problems here. The beds are comfortable and clean, the television channels are not very clear and only a few work. The bathroom door had no lock on it, the window in the bathroom window only slided up a few inches and was very stiff which was no help when the bathroom got steamed up. To flush the toilet, we had to stand there holding the button down as the toilet pan cleared away slowly. The decor of the hotel is no where to matching those pictures shown on the British Airways Holidays website. The Hotel is run down, very old looking, stained carpets and very dim lighting. The hotel has 24hour free tea and coffee facility in the reception/bar area. For all you guys who love your tea and coffee i advise you take your own from your country of departure. The hotel uses 'Liptons' tea and filter coffee, which both are niether strong in visual or taste. However there are plenty of Starbucks Coffee shops within walking distances of the hotel if you want a good quality cup of tea or coffee at reasonable prices. (I do recommend Vanilla Latte from Starbucks, absolutely delicious!) The hotel does not have a restaurant, so you will need to go out for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I highly recommend that you do not eat from the store/cafe across the road from the Ameritania Hotel entrance, its not busy and the food is held under hot lights all day long. The hotel is in a good location, close to Times square, Central Park and the theatre District on the Broadway. If you wish to go and see a show, Chicago or the Lion King are the shows to be watched. I recommend this hotel for young couples and people on a low budget who dont mind staying in a hotel with minimum facilities. If you like a hotel with alot of facilities, then i do not recommend this hotel to you, if you just want a bed to sleep on and a wash then this hotel is for you.

We thought this hotel was central so that was our reason for booking. We had booked six rooms and hoped we would have a view of New York! On arrival, It is tired and run down looking. Everything is a dingy shade of brown, the lighting is minimal. We were told that five of the rooms were on the 12th floor and ours was on the 8th floor. When we saw our room, 811, I could have cried. We had been travelling for hours and were now faced with a dark, dismal depressing room that would not have been out of place in a one star hotel. It had the smallest bathroom I have ever seen, the bath was almost the size of the sink. Then I saw my families rooms, which were bright, airy and spacious. I phoned reception and asked for another room, this was organised immediately for room 618. It was still brown but quite spacious and it had a larger bathroom. The bed was large and extremely comfortable. The view from the window was of the other residents rooms, there were some sights!! However, the hotel is in an excellent location, just minutes from Times Square. There is a 24 hour deli across the street, which caters for everyones needs. There is free tea and coffee available in the bar area, but be prepared to pour in the dark, as they have a desk lamp and no other lighting!! As this was a birthday surprise for my Father, we booked the Rainbow room at the Rockerfeller centre for Christmas lunch. It was just fantastic and the view was spectacular! We did all the usual sights and then booked flights from JFK to Buffalo and toured Niagara Falls. It was freezing with plenty of snow, it was a great day. We used Majestic Tours and they were wonderful, we just couldn't recommend them enough! Overall, I feel this hotel is built for location rather than comfort, however a three star hotel should not be providing 1 or 2 star rooms. In the end, we got moved to an acceptable room, but why even assume that guests would even contemplate staying in below standard rooms, why not put us into the better room to start with????!!!! We met a guest in the lift who had moved 4 times! We felt the staff were friendly and helpful. The housekeeping staff leave a very clean and tidy hotel, but it is difficult to make a poorly lit, brown, tired hotel into anything better!

The holiday itself was booked almost a year in advance and couldn't wait to arrive in NYC as it had always been a dream to visit. On arriving at the hotel my first appearance was that the lobby and reception area were a little dark but clean and contempory looking. There is apparantly free tea/coffee available 24hrs a day I believe in the lobby but we didn't make use of this facility so not sure how good that was. In our experience the reception staff and porters could not have been more helpful, and were very accomodating. I am chlaustrophobic and can't use lifts, and when we explained that the room we were given on the eleventh floor was unsuitable we were immediately changed to a room on the third floor. We were a little dissapointed with the room itself at first but appearances can be deceptive, and we found both the room and bed to be clean and very comfortable. It is true that the rooms are very small but we found them to be big enough, after all you'll only be sleeping there. As we were there in December it was very cold but the heater in the room was very effective, a little noisy but nothing ear shattering and there was plenty of hot water for a shower. We were a little unlucky that we had quite literally no view of NYC from our window (just a view of part of the roof in fact), but if your after a view you need to just step outside and look all around you. If like me you aren't a lover of lifts there are stairs but be warned they are hard work to climb and the stairwell looks very old, cold and dark (not very inviting). The location of the hotel is fantastic though, we walked everywhere! The hotel is literally just off broadway, which if you follow all the way down leads to times square. Overall I would say check it out, it's not a bad place to base yourself if your simply in NYC on a budget sighteeing break. It's comfortble, clean and good location with helpful staff. I think it's only downfall is that the rooms need modernising a little and they need to improve the lighting situation throughout.

I found the Ameritania Hotel at Broadway and 54th at a really good price (average nightly rate of $335 in December). The amenities looked decent enough so I pulled the trigger. I would say for the price and location (esp in Dec in NYC), it was between \"Average\" and \"Above Average\", but I went ahead and rated this hotel at \"Above Average\" since this was my first stay with them. Let's start with the pros: They have a user friendly reservation interface and were flexible with making changes to reservations. Once at the hotel the staff was friendly and accommodating. The hotel appeared to have gotten a face lift recently, so that was nice. The bar was nice and cozy. The location was really good - it was not in the heart of Times Square, but a 5-7 minute walk and you were there. The room was big enough for 1-2 people. The bed was more than big enough and comfortable. The heater worked REALLY well! The shower was good (good pressure, hot water). The deli across the street had pretty good food and a nice salad/hot bar. They have access to wireless internet. Now for the cons: Despite the recent face lift, you could still tell that the hotel was old, which is not a HUGE deal (an old building in NYC, go figure!). The floor was pretty un-level and creaky, at least in my room. The carpet in the hallway on my floor (8th) looked like it had some water stains/damage. The TV looked at least 15 years old and was pretty small - it's picture was pretty bad, but you aren't getting a hotel for the TV, right? The bathroom was decent size but still seemed a little small. Although a small thing, the toilet paper was pretty bad - my office building has nicer TP. The closet was not particularly deep - my shirts and jacket had to be angled to fit in so the door closed. One of the electrical outlets didn't work. Overall, the price + location relative to what I got made this hotel slightly above average. If a few of the little things had no been present then I would give this rating a solid \"Above Average\". I would *probably* stay in this hotel again, but would not stay there if the same small things were not fixed my second time around.

The decor and fittings mirrored the corridor outside - predominantly dark brown, dingy and shabby. The air conditioning was so noisy it could only be switched on while the room was unoccupied. The choice at night was to be kept awake by the noise of the air-conditioning or by the sweltering heat. As a result, we left New York exhausted. The bathroom was a miracle akin to fitting a quart into a pint pot. Never before had we seen a WC designed to fit partly under a wash hand basin. Apart from the location, the only positive comment is that the bedroom and bathroom were reasonably clean, although there was a heavy unpleasant underlying smell in the bedroom that lingered in the nostrils and probably emanated from the carpet. There was no point complainiing to hotel staff since, when booking in, we were assured that we were being given one of the best rooms in the building and as similar complaints from previous visitors on this site have clearly been ignored.

When booking the room be sure to specify the number of beds and if you want a safe. There is a kenko's across the street with internet access. A good hotel for students, tourists on a short visit but probably not the best for families/ business/ romance. Stay here if you want easy access to Times Sq, Central Park, 5th Ave shopping etc. and will not be wanting to spend a lot of time in the hotel as the rooms are quite small. The best thing we did was to get the tour bus ticket offer for 3 days which allowed us to go on the main downtown loop tour and then use the buses to get to the Statue of Liberty, UN, WTC, History Museum, Chinatown etc. etc. which worked out much cheaper then using the subway everytime for each of those trips.

I arrived alone and had no trouble checking in. My room (#1109) was quite large, with a large bed and a medium-sized bathroom. There was no view, but I didn't really care. I had no complaints about the room at all. My main complaint is about the elevators. When they worked, they were very slow! And they didn't always work. One time when I was trying to leave to go to dinner, the elevators were out of order. Instead of walking down 11 flights of stairs, three other people (whom I didn't know) and I decided to take the freight elevator down. (Bad idea!) The freight elevator was very small and hot. It didn't work very well. We got stuck for awhile. And then when the doors finally opened, we were in the basement of the hotel! So we ended up having to walk through the bowels of the hotel to find our way out. An employee yelled at us and told us we weren't supposed to be down there. (Believe me, we had NO desire to be down there! It was scary!) That was the only drama I experienced during my visit. But I was very unhappy that there was no food in the hotel! (Luckily, there's a Starbucks right across the street. And \"Rays PIzza,\" also across the street, was delicious!) One of my colleagues had a very bad experience! To make a long story short, when she got to her room at 12pm one night, her key wouldn't work. She went back and forth from her room to the front desk six times trying to get a key that would work. They finally sent a guy with the master key to open her room. So she was able to get into her room, but she still didn't have a key that would work! When she called the manager to explain the situation and get a key, he said, \"Do what you need to do,\" and hung up on her!

I was concerned about this hotel because of the reviews but, as my parents had stayed there a year before, I thought I might give it a try. Let me first tell you, I wasn't this upset while at the hotel, and had a great time in NYC. But I have to be fair with my review, I don't think a had a fair price on this hotel, sometimes cheaper doesn't mean a good deal. As soon as I arrived I was a bit disappointed, nobody offered to help me with my luggage (and I walked by the bellboys struggling with my suitcases). I got to the front desk and the check-in was extremely fast and nobody walked me to my room. In a 12 floors hotel, with more than 20 rooms per floor, without any help with the luggage... that could be quite upsetting for a vacation starter. Anyway I was able to find my room on the 11th floor. I was quite surprised with it, it was actually more spacious than I expected (due to previous reviews). But, after a few minutes in there I realized it had no save box, the TV was too small and the remotes didn't work. I went back to the front desk and asked for another room. They didn't resist and gave me a new one on 6th floor right away. This one was even more spacious, and even though windows faced to another building, it wasn't dark or unpleasant at all. Unfortunately, the heating system was really old, didn't work well and made a lot of noise (after a while I got used to it). They sent an engineer who couldn't do much that late at night (or so he said). They gave me an aditional electric heater and I thought they would take care of the heating the next day, but they didn't, nor during the whole week. The room didn't have mini bar, and the hotel doesn't have a restaurant. Therefore, you are always obligated to go out if you want something to eat, or even to drink. I once sat at the lobby bar to take advantage of the free coffee, but tables were all dirty, no one seemed to care and it just didn't feel nice. So I never went back to the bar. I should have listened to other previews, this hotel is really old, hallways are really dark and dingy, it could really use a makeover and cleanliness isn't its strong suit. Besides the inconvenients I had, this was not my first time in NYC and I would like to stand out the fact that I know I could have got a much better deal.

Last time we stayed we had a room on the 7th floor, overlooking broadway, this room had 2 double beds which proved helpful in packing, unpacking etc. After requesting a room overlooking Broadway on a higher floor, we were given one on the 12th. This room had one bed which we didnt mind at all. However, the room had so many problems It seriously dented what would have otherwise been a brilliant holiday. The room was very dark, which seemed to be a permanent issue throughout the hotel, from the lobby, the lifts, the hallway and the room. I had to literally sit by the window to put make up on! The hallways and lift did not make me feel very safe, and I would have been terrified if I was staying there alone. The doormen were practically non existent, they were never there to open the door or help us with our luggage, even when they saw us struggling as we were leaving! The radiator is absolutely Terrible. Every single night without fail there would be a loud banging noise which would continue for about 10-15 minutes, this happens at around midnight.. beware. There was also one night when I literally woke up in a sweat, it was surely over 40degrees celsius. I had to stumble to the window just to get some fresh air into the room. The plumbing in the bath was also in need of maintenance, with the water not draining through at a normal pace, filling up very quickly. Although someone came to fix it, the problem was solved for literally 2 hours. And finally.. the bed. It dips in the middle. I found myself constantly fighting against gravity to stay on my side of the bed. It was really horrible. The pillows were also poor quality, it must have been filled with foam or something. The location was really good, subway just a block away and Times Square practically at your doorstep.. If you get a good deal, this hotel would be worth it..

This was much larger and had two double beds - not a bad size at all. However, this room had its problems as well, notably the toilet being blocked when we arrived there. The hotel staff very quickly sent an engineer to sort the problem out, but the overall condition of the fixtures and fittings in the bathroom was very poor. Everything was either loose or cracked including the floor tiles. The only positive thing I can say was that the bed linen was clean and the towels were very white and fluffy, and changed every day. Overall, the condition of the hotel didnt affect our enjoyment of a wonderful city, but I would never return here again and I certainly wouldnt recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "October 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for location\u201d", "Author": "Bex_Mo", "ReviewID": "UR5896702", "Content": "We stayed at The Ameritania Hotel for 5 nights for our first visit to New York.

On arrival I realised my room had not been prebooked by my travel agent as the receptionist asked if I wanted smoking or non-smoking, when I replied non-smoking I smiled sweetly and asked if I could please have a 'nice' room as I was staying for 7 nights. She nodded with a little smile and gave me a double on the 10th floor. That was great as I was expecting a single. The room was no. 1004 and had a view over Broadway. The bedroom itself was spacious enough with adequate wardrobe and cupboard space and about 5 fresh towels supplied every day, with the bed made and the bedroom and bathroom cleaned and magazines and city guides provided. The bathroom was small but the shower hot and effective, the toilet was wedged between the sink unit and shower however so having long legs I usually banged my knees on the sink unit when I used it, it didn't bother me at all though as I was so pleased with everything else. There was a view over Broadway and highrise buildings. The room must have been high enough not to suffer the effect of street noise as I am not a heavy sleeper at all but ended up sleeping really well. I did however have the air con on which blocked out any intermittent noises with its constant whirring.

I was never disturbed by any noise at all within the hotel and met some friendly guests in the lift.

We paid approx $180/night and very simply in NYC you get what you pay for. A smart looking lobby, nice bar and designer bedrooms but look beyond that and you'll find a Victorian heating and ventilation system and a lack of basic services. In the Ameritania (and I suspect the others in the group are similar given the comments that I've read) heating is by a very noisy old water radiator system that clangs, gurgles and clatters all night. And the radiators seem to have two settings ; too hot or too cold. Ventilation is an open window or a through-the-wall aircon unit that I'll bet is as noisy as hell in summer. It took a room change from the dingy twin-bedded box they first offered us to end up in a Queen room on the 5th with a view of Broadway. Not bad but not what we'd hoped for. I suspect the lesson is that in NYC there are no bargains. I hunted for one for a long time thinking the Bentley might be it - but it wasn't.

Yes the beds are small, hard as rock and on an angle, needed to be careful not to roll out of bed. The bathroom, we were very lucky that we're not overweight people, because a big person would not make it through the entrance door. The toilet is about 3 inches from the sink that would not drain. The 2 small lights in the bathroom was not enough to see yourself in the mirror - the whole bedroom was dark - not able to see the dirt, I guess. The redecorated hotel needs new furniture, as most sofas and chairs are ripped. The included \"breakfast\" is coffee, orange juice and a cold bagel... would not be difficult for the hotel to purchase a toaster for the clients to toast the bagels....

I asked to be moved to a room with a safety box as this room did not have one (not all rooms do), and was allocated another room straight away.

It certainly isn't the hotel's fault if a private agency like Cheaptickets gets their facts wrong. We would gladly stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to our friends.
