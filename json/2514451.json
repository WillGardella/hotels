This hotel delivers! First, cleanliness--this is my BIGGEST concern when I travel. I cannot stand anything that feels like it might be unclean. At 6 Columbus, my room was absolutely spotless! It was also apparent, by design, that they avoided \"dirt traps\" like carpet, bedspreads, etc. that don't get cleaned regularly, by nature. My room was decorated and designed beautifully with hardwood floors--a REAL treat for cleanliness snobs and germophobes! I wish all hotels had hardwood floors like this one, rather than the dirt-masking darkly patterned carpets most hotels use. This floor gets an A+++ with me at 6 Columbus! The bathroom was also spotless--and tiled floor to ceiling with a gorgeous contemporary feel. I love the black, gray and white contemporary feel of my room with touches of wood to add warmth. The bed was quite comfortable and I loved the freshly washed duvets and nice sheets. I was exceptionally surprised by windows on BOTH opposite sides of my room! Views on two opposite sides? That RARELY happens! What a treat! I could overlook Columbus Circle from my wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling window and peek at Central Park from my office chair... neat! I also had a nice little balcony, complete with chair and coffee table. I've NEVER been to a NY hotel with a balcony like that. Superb! For ladies---you will LOVE the high-end brand, Kiehl's amino acid shampoo and conditioner at this hotel. FINALLY a hotel that gives you ample shampoo and a conditioner that ACTUALLY CONDITIONS your hair! (Instead of that goop that rinses out leaving your hair no less conditioned than before you started.) It was WONDERFUL...to the point I want to go online and see how to purchase more! The service at this hotel was superb. Always friendly, helpful, and they memorized my name within minutes of checking in---and people greeted me by name throughout my 4-night stay. Brandon, one of the doormen, was especially courteous and helpful. They made me feel right at home. A nice, large flat screen TV and a full snack and mini-bar that was stocked well-beyond-mini status was a nice treat when tired feet and long work days extinguished some of my energy for getting to the nearby drugstore for a beverage or snack. The prices at the mini-bar weren't bargains, but weren't total rip-offs, either, given the convenience. For a business traveler, internet connectivity is always important---and I notice at a lot of hotels these days, the bandwidth is severely lacking given the multitude of devices and data-heavy use put upon them in the evening hours. At some points during recent stays, I've literally had to go without internet or tether from my phone as the hotel-provided internet (even for a fee), couldn't support the user demand. At 6 Columbus, the internet, though a bit pricey ($15/day), was rock-solid the entire time. Additionally, they offered ample outlets for charging my multiple devices. I've been a loyal member of the Hilton chain of hotels for years (Diamond level), but I chose 6 Columbus hotel for it's location to business on this particular trip, and it's price (a little less than other nearby hotels), plus other reviews I read about its quality. For me, not staying at a Hilton chain is a deviation from loyalty that I rarely make. That said, whenever I shall return to NYC again, I'm definitely going to consider the 6 Columbus. It's been a true pleasure from start to end to stay here. Thank you, Thompson Hotels, for the excellent service and experience at 6 Columbus. I will definitely consider you again next time I am in NY or another city that has a Thompson hotel.

The property reminded me of a stay in a boutique hotel in South Beach Miami. I booked with an internet travel site for a last minute deal, and was supposed to move to a different hotel for the last two days of my stay. I enjoyed the first night so much, I asked if they had availability to extend, and they did, so I cancelled the other stay. The location is amazing, at the top of W 58th just as you enter Columbus Circle. It was an easy walk to Times Sq/Broadway and Hell's Kitchen resturants, A subway stop is directly across the street. I was in a king room and did not find the room to be loud from street noise as I have in past NYC hotels. Also found the room size to be bigger than what I normally expect from NYC. Room was nicely decorated, not over the top with a good color scheme. The heated floor in the bathroom was a nice surprise. Be sure to check out the roof deck, it wasn't open for the season for service, but was open to sit and work from, it was a nice quiet \"retreat\" from a busy day of work. As others have mentioned the restaurant is supposed to be amazing, but it was full each night I wanted to try it. People waiting to go in did also rave about the food. The staff can truly make or break your experience, and as mentioned in the opening they were just amazing.

Fortunately, I didn't have to find out. I was upgraded without asking as I checked in. Room didn't have a view but was spacious and clean. For one night, it was great.

Two complaints of rooms with no heat have already been lodged at the front desk, and as the wind whips by the window this doesn\u2019t seem to bode well. The lobby, fronted by two very friendly door-men, is a balance of light and dark \u2013 coolly modern in style, like the rest of the hotel, but warmed by the staff. A sushi restaurant (Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill) is set off to the side, affording a tantalizing glimpse of a light wooden bar. While Columbus Circle is not usually an area in which I\u2019d stay while visiting New York, an online special ($140 a night, before taxes) lured me to 6 Columbus, and I\u2019d heard good things about the parent company that runs it (Thompson Hotels). A slightly dim elevator and hallway, the textured navy blue walls and dark floors eating up much of the light, lead to room #77. Like most New York accommodations, the pod rooms here are on the slightly smaller side of things (175 square feet), so it might be worth it to upgrade to a larger one if possible. The bathroom is more ample, backed by glossy navy tiles and brightly polished Waterworks fixtures. Bolstered by Kiehl\u2019s hair products and white fluffy towels, it is a modern, elegant space, even if an over-hyped Frette bathrobe errs on the side of starchy rather than soft. Above the bed is a large Guy Bourdin print, echoing the proclaimed\u201c60\u2019s modernist\u201d inspiration point for the hotel. The bed itself is comfortable, but not laid out with any top sheets \u2013 only a duvet. I\u2019m neither picky nor grossed out about such things, and, as long as the heat was working, didn\u2019t have need for extra bedding. A word about the heat: despite my concerns upon hearing the complaints of other patrons, the heat in my room worked just fine \u2013 but it didn\u2019t make it into the bathroom, which was a great deal cooler (not the ideal situation for January). I had to overcompensate in the bedroom to warm the tiled space, but it was nothing a hot shower didn\u2019t fix. On a Sunday night, the room remains pleasingly quiet, affording an uninterrupted evening of sleep.

When I arrived, I saw that I had been assigned to the small POD room which is only suitable for one person. I was planning to have my sister join me the next day so I asked for a room with at least a Queen bed and was told the hotel was completely sold out and nothing larger was available. When I went up to my room, I checked the hotel website on my computer and that indicated that there were plenty of rooms available with Queen and King beds so apparently the front desk staff have been instructed to only issue POD rooms to Priceline customers and then lie to them if they ask for anything larger. This is in violation of the agreement this hotel has with Priceline in which they indicate they will treat a Priceline customer the same as anyone else. Because this room was so small and dark, I called my sister and told her not to bother coming after all since the room was not large enough to accommodate two people with any degree of comfort. I know this hotel considers itself 4-star but when you get a 2-star room in a 4-star hotel, it's no deal. I've had much nicer rooms in 2.5 star tourist class hotels in NYC than the one I was given at 6 Columbus. I've stayed in many different NYC hotels and this is the first time I've ever been discriminated against because I booked through Priceline so I will no longer choose the Central Park zone to avoid getting this hotel again. That's unfortunate because the other hotels in this zone do not give Priceline customers lesser treatment and I'll miss out on being able to stay in these true 4-star hotels as a result of this experience. In case anyone from the hotel reads these reviews, if you consider Priceline customers to be inferior to your other clientele, why do you bother participating with Priceline? It's not mandatory. On the plus side, your doormen are great, always very pleasant and accommodating.

Not to worry, we saw the hotel through an arch way -- it's located on W58th street, just south of the Columbus Circle. Peter, the doorman/bell, helped us with our bags and was great through out our stay. We arrive early, as we had just disembarked from the Queen Mary 2 in Brookyln, and had to wait a bit as they searched to see if a room was available before noon. We had booked on Priceline, but they had no reservation in the hotels system; this would turn out to be a huge hassle at check out! The clerk who checked us in was nice and said she would solve the problem. She took our paper work to the manager, and he did upgrade us to a King room on the 9th floor, but didn't fix the problem with the booking. While we were waiting for a room, Perry the concierge was super helpful and even checked us in for our flight the next day. Can't say enough positive things about the out front staff of Peter and Perry! In their quest to be chic and different (like fur lined walls), the hotel has poor lighting and everything is dark and a bit strange. Having said that, we did enjoy our stay and our room was clean and in a good location. (no street noise) The location of the 6 Columbus Circle Hotel is perfect! At check out, we had a different clerk and she tried to charge us for the room, and once again I had to produce my paperwork. The whole time this is going on, Peter is holding a taxi for us outside, for our trip to the airport. After 30 minutes of back and forth with the manager in the back, we just told them to fix it and we had to leave. It took two calls to Priceline after we returned home to finally fix the issue.

I arrived in NYC when most of the midtown hotels were filled up, so I stayed here. Big mistake. The room is tiny -- MUCH smaller than my college dorm -- no desk, no chair to put things on, no table, so you literally spread your stuff all over the floor, and there isn't even much of that. For the $220 I paid (before tax), the bathroom comes with a bottle of shampoo and no conditioner and no lotion. They couldn't spend the extra dollar for one of those tiny conditioner and lotion bottles? Also, for the $220, I you get just one bar of soap, not one for the sink and one for shower, although I could live with that I suppose. I'm just showing you the pattern here -- for your hundreds of dollars, you're buying a Motel 6 experience. Copying a style from Germany, the beds have a bottom sheet but no top sheet -- just a comforter. But the comforter isn't a REAL comforter, it just looks like one. It's really no warmer than a VERY light weight blanket. If you arrive in NYC during cold whether, and you like to keep the room at 65 or 68 degrees at night, you will freeze because, above your body is no sheet, just a very light-weight blanket. So you need to turn the thermostat up to 75 degrees or something to stay comfortable. By the way, whether you put it on cool or heat, the sound the air vent makes is a LOUD ROAR. If you guess the wrong temperature, you might, as I did, wake up in the middle of the night sweating heavily. Finally I had enough and called the front desk and asked for a two blankets and a sheet, so I could turn this into a real bed. So the bellman brings me a sheet and two towels. So then I called the manager, who told me they were out of blankets! What would you do in this situation if you were me? I'm a pretty easy-going guy, but at this point I lost it and yelled at him. He offered to bring me a space heater. I asked him what would a space heater do? I told him that if he had no blankets -- and ALL hotels have extra blankets except this one -- hen fine, I'll freeze or boil to death or whatever, just take half off my bill. What do you know, when I brought up $$$$, he mysteriously \"found\" anther of the fake comforters. So now I had an extra sheet and two fake comforters, i.e. two very, very light blankets. I'm actually writing this in the middle of the night, having been up for an hour with this nonsense. I'm going to put the sheet and the the other light-weight blanket on the bed and try and go back to sleep. Summary: You'd need to be insane to stay here. By the way, since he heater/air conditioner is so incredibly loud, I did take the manager up on the space heater offer, thinking that at least that would be quieter. Nope -- the thing was so battered and old that it made even more noise than the room heater, and believe me, that isn't easy. if you're in Ne York on business and need your sleep, or if you really need a good night sleep because you're here on vacation and have an active schedule, then all the more reason to avoid this place like the plague. On my last trip, for the same price, I found a room at the Hilton New York on Avenue of the Americas, just 6 small blocks away, and even though that hotel is huge, it's got a fun vibe, you get a nice-sized room, you get conditioner and lotion, each bed has a blanket and comforter, each room has an extra blanket in it, and you're even more in the heart of things in terms of location.

I booked a pod room on the website for $150 for two nights. Room was very hip, very nicely updated but that was it. It was a smallish double bed, reading lights on headboard were not working. Despite putting the heat up to max, cold air cranked all night in the dead of winter. So I shut it off and froze under the very thin down douvet. (no extra blankets in room or top sheets on the bed) The Douet was so starched that the flakes were all over the bed! In the bathroom the tiled floor was supposed to be heated. Not! I left my contact lens solution next to the window in the bathroom and due to the lack of heat overnight, when I woke up it was getting crunchy (starting to freeze). My shave cream was indeed frozen. Hair dryer was missing, so after a night of no sleep as I shivered in my bed, I looked like crap the next day for work. Upon asking the front desk first thing in the morning for a room change (asked them to move my luggage while I was at work) and an upgrade for the hassle, not only did they not relocate me before I returned, but they put me in another shoddy pod room. In this room I went to roll up the shade on the window to see what my view was and the entire mechanism fell off the window. Clearly this happened to the occupant before me. On another subzero night, I had nothing blocking the cold air from coming in. Although this time the heat did minimally work. These rooms are the size of my walk in closet at home. There is not much space to maneuver around the bed. Infact you feel like you are literally in a POD or a CELL. The shower stall in the next room must have been built on the wall right next to my bed.

No business center, but the staff printed some things for me. No desk, so it was difficult to work. No place to store luggage--I ended up putting my suitcases in the window, which had a view of nothing.

I switched to The Pod half-way through, which cost a third of 6 Columbus, and even though the room was smaller (I guess that's possible!), I felt more comfortable there because it was very light. The Pod also had ample toiletries, a desk, a great shower (I opted for an in-room bathroom) and FREE wi-fi (whereas it cost $10/day at 6 Columbus). And it was every bit as hip and clean, and only 2 blocks from the metro. Bottom line--6 Columbus is not good for a business trip, and I probably wouldn't stay there for a personal trip either, especially if I were with my spouse--we would be on top of each other and there wouldn't be enough room to store our belongings--there was barely enough room for just me.

I travel as a consultant to non-profits, and my clients understandably want to keep hotel expenses reasonable, which 6 Columbus's rates do accomplish. I am content with a hotel that falls far short of luxury, but 6 Columbus did not meet basic needs. The rooms are small, including \"suites,\" which, surprisingly, are not really suites but rather single rooms like all others. My room reminded me of a college dorm room. It had no closet but did have a small armoire, regrettably not deep enough to hold a clothes hanger back to front, and wide enough to hold very few shirts or suits. Inquiring at the front desk, I was alerted that two cupboards were built into one side of the base of the bed, which I had not seen since a duvet hung over them. This helped, but it meant I had to get on my knees to retrieve anything. I was a single traveler; I cannot imagine how more than one person could negotiate this room. Of course the hotel finds plenty of space for its in-room mini-bar, food, and souvenir concessions. That duvet, by the way, was not clean (showing organic remnants of a previous guest), and was finally laundered or replaced on the fourth day, despite my earlier requests. The duvet is the only bed-covering: there's no sheet, so you sleep under the duvet (which, for me, became unbearably hot) or nothing. I soon realized this was not such a bad thing. Because the noise level is high (especially from staff in the hallways--and I was not even near the elevator), the only effective strategy is to turn the AC way down so it runs as much as possible to drown out the noise at night, and then it's so cold in the room that the duvet is perfect. A large roach or water-bug ground into the carpet remained for several days after my arrival (and impossible to miss) until I forced the cleaning person to deal with it as I stood by and watched. The cleaning staff was invariably pleasant; one day, however, I returned to the room at 5 in the afternoon to find them just starting on my room, which was inconvenient. The room telephone received calls, but I could not dial out or retrieve messages that were left (though they announced their presence through the blinking light). A manager came to the room to try to fix it and confessed that the hotel's whole phone system was \"a total mess.\" In two weeks the phone was never fixed. One night I called the front desk, via my cell phone, to arrange an early wake-up call the next morning and the call arrived as requested. The next morning after that someone from the staff banged on my door at the same early hour, shouting that this was my wake-up call but my phone wasn't working. (Unfortunately, that was to have been my sleep-in day.) Room was quite dark, even with all the lights on full, as the window gave on to a deep air-shaft that let in little light. Bathroom was to the usual small-hotel standard. Hallways are very narrow and are made more difficult to navigate by room-service trays, which spend entire days without being collected. Sometimes these sit in stairwells, which must surely be a safety violation. The in-room information book says they deliver the NY Times every morning, but instead they delivered the NY Post, an entirely different species of newspaper. I pointed this out at the front desk, and although the staff-person seemed not to grasp what I was saying, they did deliver the Times (along with the Post) the next day and most days thereafter. Front-desk staff was generally cold and unhelpful. Concierge was pleasant and doormen were eager and cheerful.

Internet is $10 per day; I might expect a hotel that tries to trade in trendiness would offer it for free, as so many now do. They do respond somewhat to nudging.

We lived in Hollywood during most of that time, and we encouraged many, many of our friends to stay there while visiting us in LA. We also spent several NYE's and multiple Memorial/Labor Days with you. Since we moved from LA, we chose you to stay when business brought us back to LA. We LOVE the Roosevelt Hotel!!!! We have always been treated with the utmost respect and, in fact, were recently upgraded when we checked in for a 1-night stay in 11/08. Based on this love, we booked the Six Columbus via a travel agent to celebrate my husband's 39th birthday this past weekend, for a studio suite at the rate of $220/nt. Although there were cheaper rooms available at your hotel, we decided to spend a bit more since it was my husband's birthday. We were so sorely disappointed that I must bring it to your attention in the hope that it will be addressed. We arrived in NYC at approx 4 pm on Wed June 3rd, 2009, and travelled to the Six Columbus, which took approx 1.5 hrs by the time we got our luggage. Our plan was to check in, freshen up and then meet up with friends for a dinner reservation at the Gramercy Park (Rose Room) for dinner at 7:30 pm. When we arrived we were informed that the front staff already knew about Dean's birthday, and that we were being checked into room 111, \"a very nice room.\" When the bellman took us up to the room, we were disappointed to discover that the room was not in any way a \"suite\", but a regular (albeit nice) hotel room. We contacted the front desk, and the person assured us that the room was in fact a \"studio suite\" even though there was no suite area whatsoever, and the room did not match the room photos displayed on the website we had booked through (www. newyorkluxuryhotels.com). Even the bellman who brought our bags confirmed that the room was not considered a \"studio suite\" but a king superior room. We felt hustled - our first and stereotypical experience of NYC. We contacted the travel agent with whom we had booked, and that agent began the process of straightening things out, and ultimately relocating us to another hotel. All the while, time marched on as we attempted to solve our problem ON MY HUSBAND'S BIRTHDAY in the hope of making a timely dinner reservation in NYC. In the interim, the (lovely) bellman came up and informed us that the manager, Costas, had \"upgraded\" us to a king suite. The bellman took us down to room 20, which was the EXACT picture on the website depicted on that site of the studio suite that we had booked (as well as the king suite on that site). Unfortunately, the room was on the second floor directly overlooking the street, and EXTREMELY NOISY. Because we knew that we were being jerked around, and that this room was not an \"upgrade\" but the original room that we were promised, we protested. By now we had lost any chance we had of making our reservation at the Gramercy Park for dinner, and we were still dealing with our room situation. My husband went down to discuss the situation with the manager, \"Costas\", and came up fuming with the comment that he should have known he was going to be hustled by a Greek (my husband is himself Greek - in fact we were married in Santorini, Greece). Extremely disappointing start to our NYC trip, and we did in fact miss our dinner reservation at Gramercy, which could not be rescheduled due to how busy they were that night. Basically, my husband;'s birthday celebration with friends was ruined thanks to \"Costas\" at the Six Columbus. The next day, thankfully, we moved to the Smyth Tribeca.

It was a constant hum and every five mins it would 'kick into gear' and go up to a dull roar! We both said, 'we can't stay in this room' so went down and asked to be swapped, they had a room on the 8th floor available which was nowhere near as noisy so we took that one, even though it had a slightly strange smell about it-i think perhaps a weird air freshener? Room 845 (i think) was a bit bigger as well, and also had a window you could look out not a frosted glass window where i felt a bit claustrophobic like in the 2nd floor room!

We found 6 Columbus through Tripadvisor and were encouraged by its ranking (#128 as of this writing). In short, we were not disappointed with our choice, as it turned out to be anf extraordinary value for a NYC hotel! First off, a caveat about the location for this hotel for people not familiar with NYC. It's located right off Columbus Circle, a good 20 minute walk from Times Square. This wasn't a deal breaker by any means, however, and the Columbus Circle Subway stop is right near the hotel anyway. A Taxi ride right into the heart of Times Square was a measly $3.50, as well. Upon arrival, the doors were opened for us and we were greeted with a smile and a polite welcome by everyone in the modern-decor lobby - a great way to start a stay. Check in was a non-issue and we quickly found ourselves in one of the animal hide (fake)-lined elevators going to our room on the 9th Floor (there are 12 floors of rooms with two floors above that). We opened the door to our Queen Deluxe room and found a warmly lit, intimately sized room with a modern twist. Dark Teak floors are throughout the the main room, and you have amenities such as a Flat-screen LCD TV, mini-fridge, safe, bathrobe, iron/ironing board, iPod Alarm Clock and one of the most comfortable hotel beds we've ever slept on! The brown teak headboard for the bed spanned the entire length of the wall behind us, but stopped short from the ceiling by about 6-8 inches. This space hid a recessed light that lent a nice, indirect glow to the room when on. The bathroom seems light standard fare, but is very clean and boasts an interesting extra feature - heated floors! What a treat to not step onto a cold tile floor after a nice, hot shower. After settling into our room, we made our way downstairs where we found Eric the Concierge. He was perhaps one of the most helpful and knowledgeable concierges we've ever had the pleasure of meeting. He helped us with everything from our dinner plans to making reservations for us at a comedy club he recommended. Definitely a great resource to have when in NYC - even if you consider yourself knowledgeable. We had lunch at the Hotel's Blue Ribbon restaurant (Japanese) and found it about average and maybe a tad overpriced - quite contrary to the hotel. Mind you, there was nothing wrong with the Sushi we ordered, but it wasn't anything to write home about and the service was impersonal but prompt. I would say it's convenient, but you have better choices literally right across the street in the Time-Warner Building.

The beds are also very, very comfortable and we both slept like babies. The hotel location is perfect. Right by the subway, a Subway sandwich shop, Starbucks, and a Whole Foods in the Time Warner Center across the street. Easy walk to Central Park and the theatre district, and when we were in a rush to make a show, the cab down cost $4 and took five minutes.

It is very close to the Trump and Mandarin Hotels. It is next door to a Starbucks & across from large grocery store (Whole Foods?). Now for the hotel itself. Check in took only seconds. The hotel features a very cool decor with a great city vibe. We went for the cheap seats and got a Pod Room - which is a full size bed. The room is tiny but it is flawlessly designed to maximize space. Do be careful not to hit your leg on the bed corners ~ can be quite painful :) The bed was very comfortable and had crisp white bedding. I must admit, we are not a fan of down type pillows. There was a stocked refreshment case, but we did not use it. The flat panel t.v. was quite nice . The view from our window, well we had a lovely view of nothing, but we were not in NYC to look out our window. Now for the bathroom....I have to say I now want rip out my own bath and copy the one from 6 Columbus! The floor is heated ...don't underestimate how incredible this feature is. NYC at Thanksgiving is VERY cold and this floor feels fabulous on your frozen toes. There is a very cool tiled shower (no tub) and great bath products. They even thought to give you Q-tips and Cotton balls....a lovely touch. The bathroom sink is really beautiful too with a cool gooseneck style faucet. The towels smell great too ~ sound weird I know, but the towels aren't perfumey, they just have a nice fresh smell to them ~ very pleasant. The hotel staff was excellent and they had our luggage loaded in to a cab before we ever blinked...they make everything look easy here. I would highly recommend giving this hotel a try.

Upon arrival, it was clear that booking via Quikbook meant that you were given the smallest rooms in the hotel. There was no way that 2 people could stay comfortably in this Queen room. There was only 1 single wardrobe, no natural light, hardly any floor space around the bed and nowhere to store our 2 large suitcases.

She showed me 2 other rooms which were much more suitable for couples and managed to offer us a larger Queen room at an extremely reasonable upgrade price. Throughout our stay, Lula made a point of checking that everything was ok with our room. With regards to the rest of the hotel we really couldn't fault it. All of the staff were extremely friendly particularly the doormen. We didn't try the restaurant but we did drink at the bar a few times and they even served sushi to us at the bar.

The double wardrobe was more than adequate and there were large drawers under the bed also. The ipod docking station was a nice touch as were the Khiels toiletries in the bathroom and the free daily newspapers. The room temperature control took some getting used to but overall it served it's purpose and the underfloor heating in the bathroom was very welcme after a hard day's sightseeing.

The area is a lot less hectic than being further south, but still convenient. The staff was extremely nice and unobtrusive. The Queen room was very spacious for NYC, with a comfy bed, desk, flat panel TV, and a huge bathroom. It was nice to see a hotel think about the people who use their rooms and provide plugs on TOP of theThe interior rooms are a bit cave-like, since you don't have a window, but the lights have slider settings so you can make the room a lot brighter than the way the staff apparently sets it up in preparation for your visit. I'm not sure why people fixate on the dark hallways - I didn't run into anything, and unlike other hotels with dark hallways, the room numbers were lit up. Overall, I loved the hotel's style, comfort and location. I don't know if I would pay full rate, but in the $200+/- range this is a good NYC hotel that would make your visit to the city very pleasant. I would definitely stay again.", "Date": "August 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "carkab@aol.com", "Title": "\u201cgreat stay in New York at the 6\u201d", "Author": "arttea", "ReviewID": "UR18504836", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel on July 25 and 26, 2008. The hotel is located at 8th Ave. and 58th St. across the circle from Columbus Circle and the Time Warner Center. I upgraded my room from a pod to a queen for an extra $35 a night. This made the rate more than I would have liked to pay as I had read posts where the rate was much better than I got but for New York it was a fair price. The front desk staff was very pleasant and helpful and great to deal with. The room was bigger than at the Hudson down the block but not really big. It was very well designed and pleasing to the eye if a bit dark. The bathroom was shiny and very modern with the right amount of room. The linens and towels were of an excellent quality and the bed was very comfortable. Everything was very clean. I would definitely book here again if I can get a good rate as the location is ideal.", "Date": "August 1, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "6 Columbus - A Thompson Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d93383-Reviews-6_Columbus_A_Thompson_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$264 - $580*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">6 Columbus Circle</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10019</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514451", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/19/08/1908edc58812c5a53f1f31b61d4298083large.jpg"}}
