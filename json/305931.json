{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Cramped Stay @ The South Pacific Whenever i visit a country, I like to look at other hotels in the area for my next stay. Have always wanted to stay here as it seems to be in a nice location and looks a nice hotel. The reception staff here were very depressing and not welcoming. Then he said he give me an upgrade to a superior room. I thought wow an upgrade!! How more disappointed could i have been.Knowing Hog Kong rooms can be on the small side, this was small and not enough room to throw the proverbial cat around. I wish somehow now i stayed at the Cosmo Hotel just up the road. I also wondered that if this was a superior room, what would the original standard room be like?Additionally, hotels in Hong Kong usually offer you free bottles of water and here you had to pay for it or make a small trek to the corridor to put your glass through a small opening to the water dispenser. Additionally, when guests were departing/entering their rooms, the automatic closing door made a noisy bang each time. None of this smooth shutting of doors that they supposed to do. The one positive point is that Housekeeping were available 24 hours and very helpful and made the room when you wanted it made. Also they were very prompt when requesting additional pillows and towels. Also i must congratulate the innovative Christmas decorations in the lobby, where the decorations were all made from recyclable items. Sadly this didn't make it to your room where you usually get the help the environment card. Would I go there again. NO. Was i disappointed from my original desire to stay there.

The hotel was nice, the entrance was extravagant and seemed very nice. However, the room was very small, which was disappointing as the pictures seemed a lot larger. The room was clean, but very small.The maids did a good job, however, it was just too small for two people. The rest of the hotel was faultless, the restaurant was nice, good choices of food, and the staff were amazing, could not do enough to help you.Nice hotel, just watch out for the size of the rooms.

We have stayed at this hotel for the past 15 consecutive years now always on on the Executive Floor. The decor is very nice and all the little extras that come with that floor make your stay even more enjoyable. In 2007 we treated ourselves and stayed in an Executive studio room, where there was a main bedroom, large bathroom and spacious lounge. That extra room is great when you are there for 10 days. Loved that so much we stayed in the same room this year and will again next year. We loved the food in the La Pacifica Restaurant for dinner and was lucky enough this year to be treated to their new Stone Grill menu in the La Pacifica. Well worth trying!!!Complimentary drinks and canapes in the Executive Lounge was great to relax to after being out shopping all day. It was even great to have in-room broadband connection. The staff are more than helpful, especially the housekeepers that maintain the rooms. It's good to go back every year and be remembered by the housekeeper, bellboys, front desk staff and Restaurant staff. The Director of Sales and Marketing is a lovely lady and we thank her greatly for looking after us for so many years.", "Date": "Oct 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR274752946", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "BlackCobra96"}, {"Content": "Satisfied I stayed here for 3 nights.

Both stays were in the trade fair peak season and as expected, the rates weren't exactly cheap anywhere in Hong Kong.On our first stay, we took an Executive Studio which is basically two standard rooms with a sliding glass divider in between. Our son slept on the pull-out sofa bed which was comfortable enough for a 120 kg heavy weight. We were on the 22nd floor and had a refreshing view of Happy Valley thru the large picture windows. The decor and amenities of the Executive Studio is on a par with the more expensive Park Lane and Excelsior in Causeway and it's only five minutes longer in walking distance to MTR station and the centre of Causeway Bay.Internet wi-fi access (we didn't find an ethenet socket in the room) was complimentary in the Executive Studio but it's only good for one laptop. Apparently the server records your MAC address on first log-in and the same log-in could not be used for a second lap top and we had to purchase a 7-day pass for about A$50 - not that bad by Asian standards for the second laptop.It was nice to be able to enjoy a free quick light breakfast and coffee in the Executive Lounge with a sweeping view of the surrounding area in the morning and free snacks and coctails in the evening.On our second stay, we decided to take two standard room for the same price as one Executive Studio to give our adult son some privacy. We were given two ajoining rooms in the high teens and still had a pleasant outlook. However the decore (tired) and bathroom amenities (very basic) were so different to the Executive Studio that we thought we had booked into a different hotel! Each individual standard room at about 20 sq metres, is also a bit cramped. Nevertheless, the standard rooms were spotless and housekeeping standards were just as high as the Executive Studio. Internet was not free in the standard rooms but the charge was still reasonable at A$50 for 7 days. We missed the Executive Lounge privilages.This is a property under Chinese ownership and management and attracts more Asian guests than say the Excelsior or Park Lane. Nevertheless the Asian (mainly mainland Chinese) guests were polite and well mannered and did not make too much noise like the groups we have encountered in some cheaper hotels on the Kowloon side.The hotel's staff were without exception very helpful , friendly and efficient. Reception staff had a good command of English and the bell boys and housekeepers spoke and understood enough English to do their jobs. The doorman - an unusually small built Sikh gentleman was excellent.There are two small laundries on the side street (hang a right as you exit the main door) which offers same day bag wash for a very reasonable price. The same side street is also a short cut to Time Square and MTR station. While perfectly safe to take the short cut, be prepared for a very crowded experience with locals going to/from the local wet market and assorted food stores, especially on weekends.We only ate at the Executive Lounge (basic continental breakfast) and the LuLu restaurant in the basement. The LuLu has a reputation as a better Shanghai restaurant among locals. While not cheap, they give you back about 50% of the bill in gift vouchers which can be used for another visit.There is only one bar in the hotel which is the Sky Lounge on the top floor. While offering a sweeping vista of Hong Kong, it is very much a Chingrish hangout - loud live music and smokey. It also has a minimum charge of about 3 beers worth per person - no exceptions even for hotel guests.In summary, this is the cheapest clean and friendly hotel I could find in the Causeway Bay area (well, technically it's on the boundaries of Wan Chai) that offers full service (room service, bell boys, doorman etc). If five more minutes of walking to the MTR and shops doesn't bother you, I would certainly recommend it as good value for money. Off seasons rates are under A$100 for a standard room.BTW Causeway Bay is in my opinion an amazing area. There are shopping opportunities every few steps and the choice of restaurants is endless. If you are attending a trade fair at the Convention Centre, the South Pacific offer a free shuttle. If you have business downtown, the MTR (probably the best in the World) will get you there in 15 minutes.", "Date": "Jul 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR768269969", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Chepol"}, {"Content": "Family friendly too!

Safe to walk around even at night. At first, I am hesitant to book here because we are a family of five (their max. is 4 per room). I book in the executive studio room so its larger, equivalent perhaps to 2 standard rooms. We had 2 single beds in the bedroom then they removed the sofa and laid down another bed. I really appreciated what they did just so we could all have comfortable sleep.

My uncle, a local travel agent, recommended this hotel as a reasonably priced hotel that was conveniently located.  We were satisfied with our choice, though not terribly impressed. The room was small, really barely fitting two twin beds, a desk, and a night table, leaving very little room to walk around, or to store our large suitcase. The cleaning staff was friendly, and attentive.

Our view was of the back of the next building - not very pretty.  Location is close to central, about a 10-12 minute walk to the MTR, and a 5 min walk to the trolleys. Times Square is a huge shopping center, with a large food court, which is only 5-10 minutes away (current street construction makes the way difficult to find though).  The most convenient part of the hotel is the airport shuttle you can book from the lobby. It's about $20 one way and drops you off directly at your terminal.

There was a very small TV with just one english speaking channel (Discovery) working. All lights have to be switched from a board next to the bed.

However, this did not pose any problems at all.It is about 10 minutes walk from the Causeway Bay metro stop and about the same from the the Wan Chai metro stop.However, we often took the tram which is only 2-3 mins walk from the hotel.It is located very close to a number of restaurants and 7/11 stores for daily supplies and Times Square shopping centre is only a 10 minute walk too.", "Date": "Mar 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR165003339", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mrsgeordio"}, {"Content": "Will go back!

The hotel is situated on Hong Kong Island in an area where the Chinese workers live. Although not particularly a tourist area we found it facinating visiting street markets and such. The hotel was being renovated when we stayed there and to be fair it needed updating. The rooms were clean and about average for a three star hotel. We ate once in the hotel and found it to be a little more expensive than comparable nearby restaurants but the quality was good. The top floor of the hotel is the starlight lounge and overlooks Happy Valley Racecourse. We found it an ideal place for a night cap and to look out over the island.Getting to the hotel - use the airport express train - its excellent - and there are a numerous taxis available on your arrival at Hong Kong rail station. Hong Kong is the last stop of four on the track and, on your return, you can check your baggage at the railway station for your next flight - a brilliant idea!Our favourite day out was to the Po Lin Buddha on Lan Tau Island. The organised trips would have cost about \u62e2120 each but the MTR (about \u62e210 for as many trips in a day as you want to take) stops at the skyrail (\u62e220 for 2) that takes you to the buddha.Would I stay there again - probably not because it is a little far out from the attractions on a short stay - but thats the only reason why I wouldn't.

The front desk staff are SNARLY and obviously hate working there. The hallways are SMELLY, dimly-lit dungeons with ceilings so low, I barely cleared them. The rooms smell DAMP and MOULDY. The rooms are so SMALL, you have to get into and out of the bed from the foot of the bed because both sides of the bed clear the walls by only a few inches.

We are repeat visitors to Hong Kong and we often stay at the South Pacific Hotel (since 2000). In that time we have been able to book rooms from online websites for $60-75 USD. This makes it an excellent value hotel. Yes, the rooms are rather small, though the size depends on where you are in the curve of the building. We have experienced rooms that were in great condition and some that were a bit worn, but they have since been renovating the building. Ask for a recently renovated, non-smoking room. The non-smoking floors are also much quieter.What we love about the South Pacific: The CLEAN duvet covered down comforters; the friendly Sikh doorman in full regalia; the cheap laundry next door; the nearby outdoor market with wackie seafood; quick walk to Time's Square with its excellent food court and cheap sushi; nearby Pizza Hut and Starbucks (Time's Square) for when we need a quick western food fix; in-room safe and electric kettle. We haven't eaten at the SP restaurants, except for the breakfast buffet, a convenient and hearty meal for an okay hotel restaurant price (we remember it as $10-15 USD). Location is what makes the hotel worth its price, as from the SP you can easily get to any point in HK. Easy walk to the nearest MTR (10 min), tram/bus stop (2 min), taxi rank (right outside the door - ask the Sikh doorman!), Wan Chai Star Ferry terminal (10 min), Time's Square shopping, entertainment and food (5 min).FYI - Take the Airport Express train to Central. From there catch a taxi to the SP for $25-50 HKD depending on traffic. If your taxi driver doesn't understand where you want to go, point to the free, bilingual map that you wisely picked up at the airport! (We just hand them the hotel's card, but you probably won't have that if you're reading this!)Check out the egg tarts ($2 HKD) at the bakery near the 7-11. 7-11 is good for the South China Morning Post in the morning and a cheap can/bottle of beer in the evening. Also, check out the little evening waffle/fish ball/fried tofu stand on the corner near 7-11. The tall bald man serves a mean sweet waffle with peanut butter! The SP mini-bar strategy is to price things high enough that you won't want to buy anything. This makes it easier for everyone, we guess, especially since they don't mind if you stash your own drinks from 7-11 in the fridge!

The fare for the MTR was only 5 hong kong dollars which works out to about 35p.I can honestly say the MTR system is ten times better than the London Underground and at a fraction of the price.During the time we stayed there were road works which we could hear from our 6th floor room.
