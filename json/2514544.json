First impressions of the reception area and looking through to the dining area are great, it's not ultra modern, but looks good enough to lead you into false hope about your room. This is shattered the moment you enter the lift, which if like me, you are on the 4th floor will take a while and when you arrive the lift is not quite sure what floor you are on. As the door opens you are faced with a corridor, which as you step out into the darkness a sensor will pick up that you are there and the lights will come on - I am all for saving power, but not in a hotel. The corridors are dingy and creaky, in fact the whole hotel is creaky. Once in my room, having been upgraded to a family room, I found a single bed, about a foot off the ground and a double bed a tiny amount higher. The bedding was clean - which is a must in any hotel, however the bed covers were faded and didn't match, the room was very shabby and in desperate need of money being spent to bring them into the modern age, maybe even splash out on a carpet without holes! The bathroom smelt of mold and had many broken tiles and luckily thanks to another review on here I got the shower to a temperature that didn't peel my skin off. Once you get past the state of the room and say to yourself, \"well at least the bedding is clean\", then I am sure you will be fine, and like me then hunt around for another hotel for the next night.

Reception area and dining area were well decorated, modern and clean which left me hopeful that the room may be of the same standard....unfortunately this was not the case...the room was absolutely tiny!! It was in need of a good revamp, the beds were tiny, mirrors tiny, bathroom was tiny, what looked like a 20yr old tv which was yes youve guessed it, tiny.

We booked this hotel on a budget, but wanted to spend as much money as it took to avoid a hostel, shared bathrooms and bad neighbourhoods. London, however, ends up on a list of high-occupancy cities that means rooms are tiny and few and far between on a budget. Hong Kong and New York fit very well on this list. Our room at the enterprise was snug. It wasn't so small we couldn't move, but a few fewer feet and it would have been. Any savvy traveller will tell you this is ok, though, because you really don't plan on spending long in the room. The majority of your stay is spent on the road, at museums, in restaurants, etc. So this is a decent enough place to hang your hat, refresh yourself and get ready for the next day's wanderings. There is a tv, but it isn't huge. It has a several channels, but not too many. Other than that the room didn't have much to it. The bathroom was again, cosy, but there was enough space to it that you certainly can't complain. Overall you'd say the room had everything you needed (including an open window view of the surrounding area) but just wasn't enormous. The hotel is in a great location (or at least it was for us). For first time visitors who want to walk everywhere it was ideally located as close enough to places like the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Natural History Museum, and even Westmister or Notting Hill if you like a challenge. If you don't like a challenge there is a train station a few hundred metres away which will take you wherever you need to go in London (or Heathrow) for only a dollar or so. If there were complaints, there weren't many. The elevator moves at the speed of smell, so expect to wait. The stairs aren't the most symmetrical design and motion-activated lights switch on whenever you're around - hopefully. There's no free breakfast, but that's not a shock, and no free WiFi, but that may come in time. This hotel isn't in the centre of London, but that's a good thing. It's far enough away to be traffic-free and affordable, but close enough to ammenities that it's definitely a worth while stay. The rooms aren't exciting, but they aren't a disgrace either.

However, the bathroom, for some reason, was freezing (and the door wouldn't stay open unless you put something in between the door and wall), and no heat got in there period. When you take a shower, you have to jump out of the bathroom immediately because the floor is so cold. There was mold in the bathroom and the ceiling paint was peeling. The decor in the tiny room was horrid, like your poor grandma decorated the room with whatever scraps she had left. The bed was extremely uncomfortable, not even fit for a prisoner. My friend and I didn't even want to go back to this place after a long day sight seeing because we felt trapped. This hotel is awfully expensive for being a dump that it is.

All the basics were provided (Tea/ Coffe facilities) and the room was clean, but there was a lack of the style that we were expecting. The room was so small that there wasn't enough room for both of us to walk around the bed at the same time. The en-suite shower room was small and had mix and match fittings (mostly mix!).

The bar is good as well, if you don't want to go out, there's a big screen TV that always has a football or rugby match on. Within a short (1-2 minute walk) there are 4 great pubs, and a couple of pretty good restaurants so there's no need to stay in. I HIGHLY recommend the \"Blackbird Pub\" just a half block up Earls Court road from the tube stop. They have a great selection of meat pies. No Sweeney Todd here! The Venison (the specialty of the house) is fantastic! If you are in the mood for Italian Zizzi half a block down the street in the other direction is very nice as well, and if you get in late from Heathrow, they serve till midnight. If you are looking for a pub near the hotel, the \"Kings Head Pub\" is directly behind the hotel, and has a large selection of Beer and Ale. Overall, great value for the money.

The bathroom was clearly built into the room and things stuck out at odd angles, though everything in the bathroom worked. We also appreciated the electric kettle. Another oddity: the room key (we were only allowed one) had to be inserted into a device in the wall in order to turn on the electricity in the room.

What I liked: - Clean room + bathroom - Lots of channels on tv - Great location !! - Cheap (about 45 pounds for a double-occupancy room) - Plenty of hot water - Quaint, homey atmosphere with lots of Van Gogh paintings on the walls - Desk, night tables and armoire in room to store some of your belongings What I didn't like: - Beds are a little uncomfortable and small - Tiny room with hardly any floor space - Paper-thin walls (you can easily hear your neighbors if they are louder than average) - The shower's water pressure is extremely weak, and sometimes non-existant for a couple minutes If you are looking for a cheap but decent hotel, this is the place to book. It is great for travellers who are tight on budget but who'd prefer not to stay in hostels. I was extremely satisfied that I got my money's worth! I would strongly recommend it if you are OK with the slight inconveniences listed above.", "Date": "November 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cA balanced and truthful review\u201d", "Author": "Chavez82", "ReviewID": "UR4107018", "Content": "To sum up this place: Pros: Amazing location (seconds away from Earls Court tube) Friendly staff Clean rooms with regular changing of towels, bedding etc Multiple channel TV in room along with celing fan, radiator etc so you can regulate temperature Cons: Small rooms, even for London, but you get all you need in them! Slow lift! Slightly uncomfortable beds in truth but you get used to it In conclusion, for the price I got (around \u00a335 a night) this hotel was great in terms of location and cleanliness. I did get a double room to myself and I expect if I had shared with someone else I would have really struggled with space. If you want to live in your room, find somewhere else for the extra space. If you want a cheap base from which to get around London you wont find better for the price!", "Date": "November 12, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Enterprise Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d214327-Reviews-Enterprise_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$128 - $475*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">15-25 Hogarth Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">SW5 0QJ</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514544", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e4/a7/e4a71e3f63fbb8cbde208553c99b9e363large.jpg"}}
