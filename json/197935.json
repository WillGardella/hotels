I always choose them wherever I travel because I can count on the quality and excellent service they provide. But I would not choose to stay here again, given the opportunity. The hotel's room was quite small and under proportioned for the price I paid to stay there. The staff was friendly and willing to help but when I called to see about a different room I was told that I had accepted the room at check in and there was no reason to move me. I was disapointed when everything in the hotel was a la carte. You would figure in this day and age you would at least get free wireless internet in the room and there wasn't an executive lounge to be found. The business center was nice but I wasn't in the mood to check email at 12 Euro an hour after spending 400 Euro for the night. The location is incredible. The shopping experience you can have in the immediate vacinity is the greatest in all of Paris and you are extremely close to the Metro to go anywhere in Paris. If you don't mind walking, just turn left out the door and walk down to the Louvre or turn right for the Arch de Triumph. But if you are looking for Parisian charm, this is not the right place. Glitzy and gaudy are better descriptions of the surrounding area. For the money there are better places to stay that provide the service afforded at this price range. I would look to stay with them before coming back here.

Entrance off of the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es, impressive lobby if lacking a bit of personality. Service was good except for mixed experience with concierge one of whose only sin was to not seem to care or be interested. Room was good sized for Paris, fixtures and decorations all new and modern for Paris, bed was very comfortable. Two iPod speakers a nice touch. Gym was very small with 1 treadmill 1 elliptical 1 bike and a rack of dumbells, but was empty both times I went - free Evian and fizzy bottled juice was a nice touch. And the issues: initially I was very pleased to find that my room had one of those typical parisian mini-balconies which looked out onto the street behind the hotel (rue de ponthieu I believe). However it turned into a curse when I discovered that there is a nightclub on the ground floor when I was awoken by the clubbing crowd spilling onto the street below my window at 4am screaming and yelling. This continued onto almost 6am. On a Tuesday night. If you stay at this hotel, be advised to avoid the rooms that overlook this street (rooms ending in approximately 30-35 I think). The other notable issue was the lack of clearing room service dishes and other rubbish left outside the rooms in the hallway - I passed the same dirty finished dinner no less than 4 times yesterday. On a business trip I was pretty happy with the hotel, the comfortability of the bed, and the location. The lack of sleep was a major issue though. I would not recommend for those looking for a romantic Paris holiday - the hotel lacks charm, not to mention the gaggle of tech conference attendees who I imagine would also kill the mood if I were there with my wife rather than my work laptop.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location\u201d", "Author": "anonymous928", "ReviewID": "UR126138985", "Content": "The best part of this hotel is definitely the location! You are in the heart of Paris, situated near a key Metro stop and also hop on hop off pick up spots. The room was nice, with a very large bathroom full of amenities. There is also a fitness room that provides free bottled water, soda, and apples. The equipment was sparse, but we never saw anyone else in there so it was not a problem. The lobby is spacious and there were nice touches throughout, including throwbacks to the former purpose of the building - a Louis Vuitton factory. As the food in Paris is very expensive, we chose not to eat in the hotel, but there are numerous eateries in the surrounding area. We also went to a local supermarket one night, which provided a pleasant meal in the room away from the hustle and bustle of the city. There are doormen stationed outside the hotel, but they never once greeted us or even cracked a smile. Perhaps they are just there for security and not customer service. The only other glitch encountered during our stay was the extremely late turn down service. The first night, we were exhausted from jetlag and sightseeing and we were already asleep when they knocked on the door at nearly 10. They did not identify themselves, and when I said we didn't want anything it took a while for them to go away. We were prepared the rest of the nights, as service continued to be provided around that time. The main draw of this hotel is definitely the location, and I think that is what you pay for.

It's many, many years since either of us have been to Paris and we were initially a little apprehensive given the reputation of the city for being unfriendly (I acknowledge that we live in London, which can be equally unfriendly!). We were thrilled to be proved wrong. The staff at the hotel could not have been more attentive, helpful and polite. Actually, we were treated extremely well by everyone that we encountered during the weekend. Even the Metro staff went out of their way to be helpful; a system which, I would suggest, could be a little daunting if it's something that you're not used to. That said, the numbering of the routes is really simple and easy to use one you've figured out which direction you're heading in. The hotel is in a good location, with handy access to the Metro. If you can get away with not using it, I would do so as you will gain so much from wandering around the city on foot and there really are some hidden gems down the little side streets. The hotel was also extremely accommodating as we arrived particularly early, not expecting to be able to check in, but we were able to do so. We can't commend the staff here highly enough. If your time in Paris is limited, I would recommend the Marais district for mooching around; and eating too. Also, it was suggested to us that we should walk down the Rue du Faubourg St Honore as opposed to the Champs-Elysees, which we would endorse. A fabulous city.

Best Paris Marriott.\u201d", "Author": "surfinginflorida", "ReviewID": "UR124405231", "Content": "When we were choosing which Marriott to stay in Paris, we had a hard time choosing between this one and the Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe, so we stayed at both. In this review I will compare the two because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure many travelers are faced with the same decision. Check-in: We tried to get early check-in to both the Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel (Marriott) and the Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe (Renaissance). In both cases, we had to wait for our room because they were getting special rooms available for us (overlooking the Champs Elysees at the Marriott, and a room with a curved window at the Renaissance). No problem, we left our luggage and explored Paris. When we returned (in both cases around 6:00), we were not in the premium rooms promised at either hotel! The rooms were nice; they just faced the courtyard instead. At the Marriott, our luggage was in the room, along with a welcome gift (1/2 bottle of wine, bottle of water and desserts) and our Marriott Rewards gift (1/2 bottle of wine and a fabulous cheese platter). At the Renaissance, we had a welcome gift (bottle of wine and some fishy-tasting crackers) but had to wait for our luggage and rewards gift. Rooms: Both rooms were nice, a little on the small side and comparable with amenities. The Marriott was elegant, with a nice garden tub and separate shower. The furnishings were elegant, the bed was not as comfortable -- it felt like there was quilt serving as a pillow-top on top of the mattress. The Renaissance was understated luxury -- more trendy furniture but a very comfortable bed. The bathroom did not have a tub, but had a nice rain shower head. The Renaissance was cleaner. Service: I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there was any comparison in service. At the Marriott, you would never touch a door \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bellmen/doormen were extremely attentive and helpful. The front desk and concierge were also great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it was nice to have our luggage taken to our room without request. My husband is a platinum Marriott member, and after reading the reviews of the Renaissance, we were very disappointed with our service. The front desk was great, but that was the extent. We would come home at night, and rather than opening the door, the bellman just stared at us (I thought he was a security guard trying to act hard). It took over two hours to get a bottle of wine that we were promised would be delivered in five minutes. Unless we greeted the reception area personnel first, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t acknowledged. Not typical for a Marriott, being French isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a good excuse. Location: Marriott is in a better location. There were several homeless people sleeping on the grates near the Renaissance. Restaurant: Breakfast was much better at the Marriott, as was the service. The Marriott was relaxing and bright and cheerful. The Renaissance was more suited for the evening, and the morning servers acted like they had a late evening out. If I went back to Paris, I would choose the Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel over the Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe. Even though the Renaissance bed was more comfortable and I enjoyed the trendier atmosphere, service is #1 and the Renaissance just wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "McKinney, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "Dapger", "ReviewID": "UR124362484", "Content": "We stayed four nights at this hotel using my points.

One would expect a first class experience. Good luck. My wife and I stayed in 2 different types of rooms. The first was a larger, more expensive room. Although it was decent size by Paris standards, it was packed with so much furniture that there wasn't room for our luggage. It seemed like we were navigating around furniture with every move. In the end, it had the feel of a very small room, with a very high price. The worst part, however, was the noise. The room was right above a restaurant and lounge area with an outdoor patio that played music well into the early morning hours. It wasn't horribly loud, but it's hard to go to sleep, and stay asleep, with a driving beat in the background. After three attempts to move to a quieter room, we were transferred to a room without the pulsating sounds of the restaurant and lounge. Unfortunately, it was tiny and had its own unique noise problems - thin walls that allowed us to hear every word of the hour long argument going on at 1 a.m. in the adjoining room. Worse yet, there was no price adjustment upon moving to the smaller room since we had requested the change. Then there was the \"service\". The doormen propped the front door open so they wouldn't have to look at the guests coming and going, let alone actually open the door or offer a greeting. They were responsive when you needed a service that involved a tip, but that's it. The front desk staff was professional, but distant and cool. Management was uncooperative regarding the room change. Certainly not a warm, customer oriented place. If you like Marriott brand properties, there is another alternative very close by that offers much better rooms and service at a more reasonable price. If you care to venture beyond the the Marriott brands, there are lots of better options for the money.

We went to dinner and came back a few hours later and finally our rooms were ready. So, rooms are finally ready. Our room is great. The kids room in on the first floor and is one of the two story rooms that other reviewers have talked about. If you are a light sleeper, avoid this room at all costs.

PLEASE DO READ MY SECURITY ISSUE AT THIS HOTEL AT THE END OF MY REVIEW. My wife and I spent 5 nights at the Marriott Champs-Elysees. The hotel itself is nice but not amazing by any 5 star standards. It's a pretty regular high end Marriott but nothing like a Four Seasons. If you picture 4 star then you will like it. The rooms are large for a Paris hotel and the location is great. It's right in the middle of all the action on the the Champs-Elysees. Metros are VERY close (1-2 minute) walk. From these close Metro hubs you can quickly get to Eiffle Tower, Marseilles, Louvre and all other attractions. As others have mentioned breakfast is really quite good and large. You do get what you pay for at 29 euros. Amazing shopping and restaurants are just outside the door of the hotel. One thing I didn't like about the hotel is that at a 5 star level I didn't like the nickel and diming for something as basic as wifi. They charge 8 euros an hour OR 19 euros a day for internet access. I thought that doesn't make sense for an $899 a night hotel. Best Western which is 2 star is offering it free as is 99% of most hotels in the area. The hotel does have parking at 40 euros a day. Steep but what the heck it's central Paris so everything is over the top. MAJOR SECURITY COMPLAINT: On our last night we had a random guy from the hotel walk in to our room unannounced at 11:10 PM with a black bag. HE DID NOT KNOCK. We had to chase him from our room and down the hallway. We are convinced he was stealing from rooms because of the way he entered and the way he left. He was VERY surprised to see us in our room. I notified the front desk immediately of this altercation and they said they would address it and i never heard back. I'm still bothered by this experience. I feel lucky we weren't gone or sleeping when he came in. It was NOT handled professionally and properly for the security risk it poses. IF YOU HAVE PASSPORTS ETC.

When we showed up at 11 am in the morning, we were greeted cheerily by our hotel receptionist who informed us that our room was ready (5 hours before scheduled check-in time!). I got a hearty thank you for being a Marriott Silver member, and was treated no differently for paying for a room with pints, instead of cash. she also reminded me that the concierge could arrange for tours, restaurants, and shuttles (and Indeed I did need a shuttle 2 days later to the other Marriott property out by Disney) ... so, I got the shuttle reservation out for the way. The room was wonderful in the way that the US chain hotels are ... lots of space, down comforters, large bathroom and AC. We even had a tiny terrace from which I could see Sacre Coeur. Everytime we left our room and walked through the atrium lobby, we were greeted with smiles and nods. The service is unparalleled. When my husband lost his glasses, they offered to call the 2 restaurants were last at to check to see if they were there!

It was the perfect decision! I have been to Paris before but I must admit, staying at the Paris Marriott made it even more special! The location was perfect. It was close to everything and you can pretty much walk to most places easily. There are many train stations around nearby as well. So if you wish to train it instead, it is right near the hotel as well. There are heaps of good places to eat nearby and one of my favourite restaurant, L'atelier de Joel Robuchon is only a few blocks away. The famous Laduree, world famous for their macaroons is pretty much just opposite the hotel. So that was another bonus. If you are into shopping, there are many big designer shops around nearby or you can walk about 15 mins or so to the big shopping place, Galeries Lafayette. The hotel itself is gorgeous! My boyfriend booked us a beautiful room, with our bed itself separated from the wardrobe areas and this large sitting area. Where our bed was it was on an elevated floor and has a beautiful balcony that opens up to beautiful Paris streets. It was so lovely. Because it was my birthday, the hotel also had two bottles of champaign chilled and ready for us to enjoy when we got there. There was also a cake and a card personally signed and addressed to me. It was sweet and a nice touch. I am certain though that my boyfriend did a lot to organised with the hotel to make it as perfect as it was! The staff at the hotel was friendly and attentive. The hotel itself is clean and looks great and so was the room. They also have a turned down service every night with one milk and one dark Godiva chocolate placed on our pillow each night. Our rates included breakfast and the breakfast selection was great. You can also order eggs cooked to your preference. We did not have dinner at restaurants in the hotel so I cannot comment on that. If budget allows, I definitely would recommend this place to everyone that wants to have a great memorable time in Paris. This hotel is simply stunning and perfect in so many ways. And if you want to enjoy the Eiffel Tower, make sure you pre booked online before you go. It will guarantee that you get to enjoy the Eiffel Tower without being in a queue for hours and be there at the time you like.

The positives: the room was comfortable, had very thick curtains, was very quiet, and the concierge in the hotel was first class. He gave us several recommendations for restaurants nearby that were excellent. The \"mediocres\": There was nothing really negative about this hotel, but there were a few things that you should be aware of. First, the front desk folks were less than receptive to our requests. They weren't \"rude\" but they certainly weren't as welcoming as other hotel reception desks have been. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived, and we waited in the lobby for about an hour even though we arrived in the mid-afternoon (well after check in time). Our room was clean, but there were stains on the sheets, and on the bathroom floor. For the entirety of our stay (3 nights) there were two mattresses sitting in the hall outside our room. Again, none of this seems like a huge problem, but they were all the type of experience you would hope to avoid with a hotel that is this expensive. The reception did offer to cover our drinks while we were waiting, good thing since the sodas we ordered in the lobby were 7 euros each!!!

The bed looked like a roll-away or fold out however. The location is excellent of course and the Metro is quite close. The hotel rooms are pretty quiet in spite of all the action on the main road below. The prices of everything from the room to extras are quite high but Paris seems to be the most expensive hotel city we know of. Try \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Paul\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd nearby for pastry and coffee if you need a snack. In general: predictable big American hotel feel in Paris. We liked it and would stay again if we got an attractive rate. Getting a taxi in or out especially with bags is tough.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cLuxury\u201d", "Author": "Europe-07-09-11", "ReviewID": "UR115301893", "Content": "Very nice hotel.

It was wonderful! The rooms are large an comfortable. We had a king sized bed, and it was very comfortable. We arrived via the RER/Metro from CDG airport (more on that later). We exited the Metro at Roosevelt, and the hotel was just about a half block away. The entrance is SOOO small, that we walked right past it! We had to go back to look for #70. Nevertheless, as soon as we entered, we were professionally greeted and relieved of our bags. The interior reception area is very nice, and the staff is impeccable. We arrived around 1:30 pm, but unfortunately our room was not ready, even though we had requested early check-in prior to our arrival. So, we had to come back after 3pm. No worries, because we just went to grab some lunch on the Champs Elysees, then walk over a couple blocks to admire the Arc of Triumph. When we finally got to our room we were pleasantly surprised. It is indeed 4 stars. We knew to request a room at the back of the hotel overlooking the atrium area so that we would have more quiet. After a day of Paris action, the last thing you want to hear is traffic and street noises from the Champs Elysees. And let me tell you, it goes on WELL into the night. They gave us a room on the top floor (#7). All the amenities were provided including a bathrobe, which we loved. They have flat panel tv's with various world channels. Not much in the way of English language tv though. Just boring CNN international and BBC. I have an iPhone, and was impressed that they offer a remote speaker set for you to plug your device into to play your music. A very nice, modern touch. They also provided free internet service in the room. We had breakfast every morning at the restaurant, and it was very nicely apportioned. There's a chef there who will cook your eggs to order, and the variety of foods is just as good as a restaurant. Breakfast was included with our room reservation since we are gold members. They provide USA Today for those who need to keep up on events. The royal couple was getting married that weekend, and it was all over the news...snore... They have a nice little workout facility with a spa and sauna and showers. They even provide towels, fruit, and drinks for free. A nice touch. The elevators are small and surprisingly somewhat creaky, but hey, that's typical in Europe. You are centrally located very well from everything in Paris at this Marriott. We were able to walk a nice big circle around the city in one day that took us first to the Arc of Triumph, then down to the Eiffel Tower, over to the Rodin Museum, then to Luxembourg Gardens, then to the Latin Quarter for lunch. Then to Notre Dame, then to the Louvre, the Tuilleries Gardens, then back up the Champs to the hotel. Yes, it can ALL be done in one day walking...we did it. Don't bring kids on this walk though...it'll be more like the Bataan death march for them. We went back to the hotel and enjoyed a bottle of wine on our balcony and relaxed. It was heaven. Later that evening, we walked back down to the Eiffel Tower to see the light show they give there at the top of the hour. It was spectacular to see it in person, very romantic, and it only takes about 15 minutes to walk it. Previous people have posted here that there are a lot of Middle Easterners at this place. It is true, but when I was walking around down a block from the hotel and up a couple more blocks, I noticed that the Embassy for Kuwait is there...so maybe that's why. I didn't notice the staff giving them any preferential treatment, however. A bit off topic, but a comment about arriving from the CDG airport. It was easy to get to the hotel. So you can take that if you want to save a lot of Euros rather than taking the Bus (the 2nd least expensive option at around 50 euro) or the taxi (outrageously priced at 90-100+ euro). Buy a RER ticket at the station, they speak English if you don't speak French. It costs about 19 Euro total for two people. You Take the RER to Chalet Les Halles, then transfer to the Metro, direction La Defense and get off on Roosevelt. It's the best exit because it has an escalator if you've got luggage. HOWEVER, on the RER train ride in from CDG , you do go through some seedy areas of outer Paris where you'll see shanty towns. We encountered lots of \"angry\" African immigrants. There were tons of them, and they all swarmed the train and just packed it up like sardines so you could barely breathe, let alone move. The mob had no intentions of waiting for the next train. Some were particularly hostile because there were a number of passengers with luggage coming directly from the airport, and it took up precious room. Very, very rude encounter, so you've been fairly warned. You should try to get a seat in the cubicles and away from the doors, otherwise you could wind up in a booby trap. I learned this lesson, so I made sure to follow my own advice on the ride back to the airport. HOWEVER, a different encounter ensued on the way back. I placed my backpack over my head on the small luggage rank (which was too small to hold our actual luggage). And when we eventually went through the seedy part of the ride, a number of roving Arab youth got on the train looking to steal from unsuspecting passengers. This teenager apparently was casing us out, and sat right behind us. When the door opened at one of the seedy stops (there's about 3 of them in a row), he tried to grab my backpack and bolt! Luckily another French speaking couple had seen him and alerted me to the situation thereby preventing him from taking my bag. I had time to take charge of the situation, so he left empty handed. The bag was right above my head, too. But you can imagine how that would play out if he did get his hands on my backpack. You run off the train after the thief, the train leaves you behind, you run around a corner only to catch up to him and his gang of friends. Now you probably have to hand over any other valuables you've got and you're at their mercy in their territory. WATCH OUT. Keep your passport and money on your PERSON at all times! It's a shame that you have to constantly have your guard up.

I'm guessing the towel smell comes from the soap they use to clean it since almost 95% of the towels smelled like vinegar. When it did not smell like vinegar, it smelled foul. Location is fine. 15 to 20 min walking to Tuileries Garden or Eiffel. There is a small park next to the hotel that has a carousel, movie theater, and Guignol shows for kids. My kids don't speak French but loved the Guignol shows (4 Euro each) that last 30 min. Special kudos to Customer Relations Manager Fabien and his colleague Maria Ferrari in room reservations.

The service was friendly and outstanding. The hotel was well kept, clean, and efficient. Below are my observations: Stay We checked in on Sunday, 26 December 2010 and checked out on Saturday, 1 January 2011. We arrived at the hotel at about 12:30 PM after very long international flight. Arrival/Check-In The entrance to the hotel is somewhat small and is between the Cafe Montecristo and the Sephora cosmetics store. I never had to open the door of the hotel one time during my stay, as there is a bellman at the door at all hours. From the entrance you go up an escalator and check in is to the right. There should be no confusion between which desk is check in, since a big sign on the counter says \"Reception\". Check in time is 3 PM, but when we arrived the front desk already had a key ready for our room. The front desk staff was very efficient and spoke perfect English. We were staying on Marriott Rewards Points, and the check in staff was still very attentive and helpful. For our Marriott Rewards check in gift we chose a platter of fruit and two drinks. We asked that the gift be delivered to our room at 7 PM so that we would have time for a nap. Later, just like clockwork, the gift was delivered to our room at 7 PM. Room We were assigned to Room 422. As those who are familiar with European buildings know, the lobby is Floor 0, so in the US this would be the fifth floor. It appears that there are a small number of rooms that overlook Avenue Champs Elysee and that a large number of rooms overlook the lobby atrium. Our room had an exterior window that opened (yes the window could be opened) onto an open air courtyard. Thus the room was exceptionally quiet. The room itself was about the size you would expect in a standard Marriott in the United States. Immediately upon entering there was closet to the right that had shelves for luggage and adequate room to hang clothes. The closet also had an iron, ironing board, safe, two bath robes, and two pairs of slippers. Upon entering the room to the left there was a large bathroom. It had a large glassed in shower with both a wall mounted shower head and a hand shower. The bathroom also had a large soaking tub with hand shower. The bathroom was stocked with high end shampoos, body washes, soap, and other necessities. It had a hair dryer, a large vanity, and plenty of shelves for storing your bath supplies. Most surprising the bathroom had a 115V outlet. Though the outlet would only accept non-polarized plugs, I was able to use it charge my Ipod and mobile phone. Unfortunately it was not powerful enough to power a curling iron. The room had a king sized bed, a desk with a chair, an arm chair with an ottoman, a dresser/tv stand, and a large flat screen television. The bed was very comfortable and had plenty of pillows. As I recall the TV had about 10 French , 10 Arabic, 1 Italian (RAI), 2 German, 1 Spanish, and about 10 English language stations. As I recall the English stations included CNBC Europe, BBC One Scotland, BBC World News, Sky News, and France24 English. The room also had an automatic minibar (don't remove items or you will be automatically charged for the item). Location/Transportation We traveled from the airport to the hotel, and around Paris, on the metro or RER. If you arrive at CDG Airport, simply go to the ticket office at the CDG Train Station to buy a ticket upon arrival. The station staff we dealt with spoke English. We traveled with the Passe Navigo Decouverte, which is a smart card that does not require the hassle of paper metro tickets (Google this for more information). From the Airport, you simply take the RER Train to the Chatelet-Les Halles Station, and then transfer to the Metro Line 1, going towards La Defense. Get off Line 1 at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Station. While the hotel is between the George V and Franklin D. Roosevelt Stations, it is nearer Roosevelt. In addition, there is an exit from the Roosevelt Station that has an escalator, which is very helpful if you have any bags. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Station exit is at about 40 Avenue Champs Elysee, so you have to walk about two blocks to the hotel entrance. This hotel is located near a number of mega stores (Disney, Virgin) and is an area that sees a lot of tourist traffic- so be ready for a large amount of people on the street. Because of this the area is very busy and there are many stores nearby that could be of benefit to you. Less than a block from the hotel is a Monoprix, with a full grocery. Monoprix has snacks, fruit, and prepared foods (sandwiches, salads, etc.) for a quick, healthy, and cheap meal. A number of quick service restaurants such as Quick (my favorite), Paul, Brioche Doree, Pomme de Pain, and McDonald's are all nearby for quick meals as well. The hotel is only two metro stops from the Arc de Triomphe, so this would be an ideal start to your visit. Because the Franklin D. Roosevelt stations is served by two metro lines (1 and 9), you can get to most places faster by transit than you could by taxi. The ticket windows seem to always be busy at this station. Services The hotel offers any service that you would expect from a full service hotel. The concierge will make reservations for you at restaurants and will even mail postcards for you. There is a fitness room in the basement of the hotel that has free weights and exercise machines. We were walking a lot and did not use the fitness room, but did notice that the fitness room had free bottled water and showers for those using the area. The hotel had a business center with computers but we did not use it. There was wifi for 20 Euro a day, but we did not use it. The hotel also offers a laundry service. We found a self service laundry (laverie) at 48 Rue Berri, that was a 5 minute walk from the hotel. This laundry came in handy and meant we did not have to pack as many clothes. Food/Dining We only ate at the hotel for breakfast. As Marriott Rewards Platinum we received a full breakfast buffet each day (even on the weekend) for no additional charge. The breakfast had eggs, hot and cold meats, cereals, breads, fruit, juice, and a whole bunch more. If you are paying for the breakfast buffet it would be 29 Euro, so you may want to go next door to Quick if you want to save some money. Breakfast was served from 6:30 AM to 11:30 AM during the week and until Noon on weekends. The restaurant menu had everything from hamburgers to fish and steaks. The prices did not seem unreasonable, but we opted for more budget items nearby. From what we saw the food did look tasty. There is 24 hour room service. Safety As noted above there is a doorman that controls the entrance to the hotel, and security staff is visible in the lobby. You need a key card to use the elevator to get to guest rooms. This hotel was a quiet refuge from the hustle of Avenue Champs Elysee. I saw very few beggars in the area and felt very safe in the subway and going to and from the hotel. Overall We really can't think of any complaints about this hotel. The service was great and was of the highest quality. The room rate is not cheap, but I think it would be a good value given the location and what you get for the money.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for a quick Paris stay\u201d", "Author": "JaeTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR90575686", "Content": "I recently booked a stay at the Marriott Champs-Elysees using points, and like many other reviewers, I was happy to reap the rewards of having Marriott status. The hotel is in a prime location for a tourist in Paris - right on the Champs-Elysees close to the FDR Metro stop. It truly helped make touring the city a breeze. Our room was in the back facing the courtyard, so while it was quiet, it didn't offer the stellar views of the city lights (which would have been lovely, I imagine, since the Champs-Elysees was lit for the holidays while we were there). It was a nice room, with a comfortable bed. The only thing slightly odd was the placement of the showerhead, along the side of the tub rather than at the end of it. Otherwise, no complaints. The service was great, as would be expected from a Marriott. A continental breakfast buffet was included in our stay (otherwise around 30euro). The variety and quality of the spread was fantastic - we often ate enough for breakfast to hold us over for a good portion of the day. Truly the greatest benefit of the hotel is the location.

It truly is a lovely hotel that is lavishly decorated and very well kept, and I'm happy that being a loyal Marriott customer has paid off.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cInexcusable disregard for guest safety - Food Poisoning\u201d", "Author": "SaltyDog79", "ReviewID": "UR90532250", "Content": "I have been a Marriott Gold member for ages as I travel frequently for business and have stayed at Marriotts all over the world. This past weekend my significant other and I decided to go to Paris for the weekend for a \"just us\" weekend before Christmas. I had stayed at this hotel before and found the location to be excellent and thought it a great way to use some of my Marriott points. A few things to note really: The location is excellent. The heating/air con is from 1970 and without a thermostat. It's a strange dial and button combo that's a bit of a guessing game. We never could get our room cool enough to sleep. I cannot speak to all other rooms but the wifi signal in 121 was so low it was unusable. A few other guests mentioned the same issue so it's worth your while to check the signal in the room before unpacking if you need internet access. The Concierge is awful. As noted on here by other reviewers the concierge service was unreliable. For a 5 star hotel this is simply unacceptable. Upon arriving on Friday night we requested the concierge book us a restaurant for Saturday night. He listed a few options from which we chose Le Duc a seafood restaurant and a time of 8:30pm. We also asked that he book us a taxi for 8pm to get to the restaurant. He told us he would call us to confirm the reservation and the taxi was no problem. By Saturday midday we still hadn't heard from him but were not concerned as we figured if he couldn't get us into Le Duc then surely wherever he did book would be just fine. Upon returning to the hotel we discovered that we had no reservation for dinner nor did we have a taxi booked. Shenanigans ensued and we did eventually get in but this was not the relaxing romantic experience we hoped for. Nor once did he apologize. If you go book your own tables and transport or risk it. By Sunday night it was clear that most of Europe was having travel delays so before we departed we checked with the concierge on the status of the Eurostar trains. True to form he gave us erroneous info and told us all trains were running on time. Now if the internet had worked in the room we would have known this was not at all true and plastered all over every travel site known to man. So after one very unnecessary trip to the train station we came back to the hotel and checked in for another night. There are worse things than being stuck in Paris or so we thought. That night we chose to eat in the hotel restaurant. One very big mistake. It certainly wasn't cheap being a 200 pound meal. The things we ate in common were the beef carpaccio and the escargot. We had different mains. By 4am were almost simultaneously and violently ill. It became fairly clear that we had food poisoning of some sort. Now these things do happen in the nicest of places. It only takes one food handling mistake for someone to become ill and to be honest at that point I was pretty willing to consider it bad luck but did feel the need to tell the general manager so they could at least examine any remaining beef carpaccio and escargot and one would imagine not serve it to other guests. I called in the morning and asked to speak to the general manager and was told he would call back. More than 4 hours later and still no one had returned my call. I called again expressing just how ill we had become and that I felt this was a safety issue for other guests that should at least be known about. 2 hours later I got a call a man who was the head of guest relations, not the general manager. His name was Fabian or Fabio. When I told him how ill we had become he told me that there was no way the food we ate could have caused it because they buy there food from quality vendors and the kitchen has been inspected. So clearly Fabian has not the most basic knowledge about food safety or food poisoning or he would know all it takes is someone using an unclean spoon to cause it. But really it was his next statement that outraged me. I was most likely ill he said because I am an American and I'm not used to fine French cuisine. Nothing like adding insult to injury. And this American happens to live in Europe and my significant other spent his entire childhood in France but thanks for the theory! He also told me he had had excellent reviews of the beef carpaccio. So nothing was done. For all I know the chef was never even told. We were too ill to even stand up long enough to take a shower so we were stuck at the hotel for another night. The pain and stomach cramps were getting to a point where we really did consider going to the hospital as it was clear we were going to need medication of some kind. In the meantime we ordered a bottle of water from room service and the room service waitress upon seeing our condition was appalled and asked if we would like for doctor to be called to the hotel. Bless this woman. It would have been fantastic if say Fabien had mentioned this option! 250 pounds later we had a doctor who confirmed yes this was food poisoning and a round of antibiotics among other things. In grand total our delay due to illness cost us nearly 1000 pounds for the extra night plus the doctor plus medication etc. The hotel never once called to check on us never once offered so much as a bottle of water. In fact when we asked for clean robes they were never brought up. The food poisoning has been so severe that now two days before Christmas we are still eating no more than crackers and water. Our relaxing weekend before Christmas is now threatening to ruin not only the weekend before but Christmas itself. The customer service was the worst I have ever experienced. I have never given a 1 star review but blatant disregard for safety is inexcusable. Thankfully we are not old nor traveling with small children or this could have had a very different outcome. I'm sure in truth one big hotel chain to the next doesn't vary greatly but I have always been loyal to Marriott feeling it was a sure bet when away from home. Not any more. Buyer Beware!

Then our problems started....the taxi i had pre ordered hadnt been pre -ordered and i had to take pot luck outside in a \"grid-locked\" Champs Elysee, to get to a surprise birthday party before the birthday boy - Not surprisingly, this didnt happen! And by the way, the extended check out that i had been given wasnt booked either, as i received a call in my room at 12.15 telling me (very politely) that check out time was midday. Our room was at the back of the hotel and was very noisy, but obviously cant blame the hotel for that. Some excellent positives next.

Fabian had little sympathy for any of my remarks, saying things like the responsibility of the hotel to help you ends when you walk out the door I.e.

We used my husband's Marriott points - and were expecting a small room since we weren't paying for it. (I don't even know how much the room would have been had we not used the points.) To our surprise, we were put in a spacious room on the first floor, with windows that opened up onto the Champs Elysees. There was a small foyer, with steps that led down to the \"sunken\" bedroom, which was spacious. King bed, twin nightstands, desk, dresser, chair and ottoman. The bathroom was huge, with a separate tub from the shower. Shower was nice but there was a huge step down into the bath area - make sure to be wide awake or it's a recipe for a nasty fall. When we arrived, it was too early to check in. The woman who checked us in, when hearing that we wanted to freshen up, gave us keys to access the gym which had showers and a dressing area. However, we couldn't find it based on the directions she gave us. (I did find it later, and it was tricky to get to.) Had the concierge hang onto our luggage while we went to the Tour d'Eiffell for lunch - it did seem like the concierge was inundated with people and we had to wait some time before being helped, without so much as a \"be right with you.\" Fortunately, all of the staff spoke English, but I tried to at least start any conversation with \"Bonjour!\" and I think they were appreciative of that. I agree with one of the other reviewers - there were lots of Arab men in the lobby lounge that seemed to be there day and night. One was perhaps a sheik or some other dignitary wearing a huge turban; in the morning we went down for breakfast, and they had set up the area for them with all sorts of pastries, with napkins covering it until they arrived. Hours later when we checked out, the set up was still there - it was like they were instructed to make sure the area was ready for whatever second these people were arriving. Breakfast was included with our stay - it was fantastic - a nice buffet consisting of everything you could ever imagine, all good quality and fresh. From what I hear from others, it would have been pricey had we have paid for it on our own. Since this was right on the Champs Elysees, I expected it to be noisy. It wasn't - initially. It was situated next to the Sephora - and at times in the early evening they had loud music to try to lure people into the store. However, this couldn't be heard from inside the hotel unless we opened the windows. Later that night, there was a lot of activity from the world cup revelers- and it seemed like one big party outside. But again, we couldn't hear much from our room unless we opened the windows. However, at 7:30 AM, we were abruptly awaken by loud dance music that seemed to be coming from either the room next door or above us. When I say loud, I mean LOUD. We called the front desk to complain, and they said they would look into it. The music kept starting and stopping; just when we thought we would get back to sleep, on it came again. My husband went out to try to figure out where it was coming from and called the desk again. They said it was the Sephora next door, and there was nothing they could do about it. That was a bunch of BS - when I opened the window overlooking the Champs Elysses, it was quiet, with no noise anywhere. I also checked and the Sephora didn't even open until 10am. We think it may have bee the Arab sheik or whoever it was, and they figured they couldn't tell them to keep it down. So overall, nice place, nice location, but it was ruined by the loud music in the morning. I wish they would have been honest with us about its origin, rather than lie and blame Sephora. If I could be assured of a quiet room, I would consider staying there again. Glad it wasn't on our dime, or we would have asked for a refund. Yes, it was that loud.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cVery quiet\u201d", "Author": "houstonmomofthree", "ReviewID": "UR71329987", "Content": "This was our first visit to Paris and we picked a great hotel.

We acutally only used a taxi twice, arriving and departing for the Air France bus to the airport. We found the book of ten tickets to be the more practical than purchasing a pass for the Metro. Our fourth floor room had everything we expected, and the view was of the patio area of the hotel restaurant, which was usually not in use due to the cool weather. We used the little refrigerator to store a few snacks, and as the items are automatically billed to the room when lifted off the weight sensitive shelf, we had a few charges result from squeezing a yogurt or cheese in. However, we let the desk know that we had not consumed those items, and they cheerfully removed the charges. ( we did not wait until the end of the week to check on this). Bathroom was fabulous. Great shower, luxurious tub, and towels replaced morning and evening. Godiva chocolates on the pillow always a nice touch. Very comfortable king bed. Morning coffee & tea in the lobby was appreciated. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel, but chose a different patisserie most days. We did have dinner one night at \"The Restaurant\". We used a Marriott \"Dinner for Two\" certificate, though we only had three of the four courses (they only had dinner sized salads, although our waiter offered to have them create a small salad for me). It was a lovely dinner, if not as many exciting choices as some places, and would have been rather expensive without the certificate. (filet of sole, 45 euros) My husband said his foie gras was the best he'd ever had, my eggplant, mozzarella and tomato terrine was terrific, and the filet of sole and steak were good, as was dessert and coffee. As it was a rainy night, it was a perfect night to stay in and enjoy the hotel's restaurant. We walked our last evening to the Eiffel Tower to watch the sunset and the lighting of the tower. It was a spectacular blue sky day, and from the Trocadero, a festive way to say good bye to Paris. When we go back to Paris, we would stay here only if we had extra Marriott points.

It was a huge suite -- bedroom with extremely comfortable kingsize bed, living area, 2 flat screen tvs, bar, and luxurious bathroom. I have found that Marriott will upgrade very easily if anything is available, unlike Starwood hotels (Sheraton, le Meridien, Westin) which want to charge you for the upgrade.

In regard to location, I love anything opposite the Tuilleries Garden, which was the Westin. We would go out in the early evening and just relax in the garden, sometimes with a picnic. It is easy walking to the Louvre, Place de la Concorde, Place Vendome, Opera area, and the Seine. The Marriott is also in a great location right on the Champs Elysees between Round Point and the Arch. It is nice for strolling and easy walking to river cruises, shopping, and convenient to the metro. That said, the Champs Elysees isn't what it used to be. We saw an increased number of beggars and homeless persons and an increased amount of trash on the sidewalks. However, it is still nice for the evening (or daytime) stroll, with lots of cafes to sit and watch the hordes of people passing by.

The room and staff were wonderful. However - one big word of caution. Usually if there is ongoing construction you will see a notation on the hotel page on the Marriott website. Nothing for this hotel was noted before we left on our trip. Upon arrival, we checked in and no one said anything about repairs/construction, we were given a room on the 5th floor.

What an understatement. The next morning, 7:10 am, I felt like I was in the middle of a demolition site - surrounded on three sides by sledgehammers, drills, metal scafolding, etc. Complained at front desk and was assured they \"would take care of it right away\" and make sure it did not happen again. No go. Kept happening. Ultimately, on day 4, we complained again, quite vocally (and we noticed that the person at the counter in the line next to us was also raising a stink about the same thing).

However, this hotel does not disappoint in terms of service, amenities, cleanliness and location. AND the breakfast buffet was great here, too. Actually, to be honest food in Paris is great everywhere you go. They take great pride in preparing food so I don't ever rememeber having a bad meal the whole time I was there. The hotel is situated right in the heart of the Champs Elysees; a couple of blocks from the Arc de Triumph and about a 20 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower. There are restaurants and stores lining the street and the crowds just don't stop--ALL day, ALL night. I lived in Manhattan for five years and let me tell you; it's got nothing on Paris in terms of tourist and local traffic alike. When you walk out of the front door of the hotel, you are bombarded by the traffic. It got on my nerves a little bit but that's just me. If you like the hustle and bustle, there is no better hotel to stay in Paris. Actually, the Mariott is the only hotel located directly on the Champs Elysees. The staff is very friendly and speak perfect English so nothing get's lost in translation. During our time there, it was my Aunt's birthday so the staff sent up wine and cheese and a lovely piece of cake with a birthday note. Very thoughtful! We were impressed. A piece of advice: Don't dine on this street. The restaurants are super expensive and rather Americanized. So are the stores. The only good experience we had was the restaurant called George V which is just a few blocks away from the hotel. The cuisine is authentic French and the service is awesome. However, this was one of our most expensive meals during our entire trip. I think my tea came to $9 Canadian after conversion! LOL Most expensive tea I ever had. One more piece of advice: If you want the absolute BEST pictures of Paris, head to Notre Dame and climb the bell tower. I can't even begin to explain how amazing the views are.

The bathrooms had both a shower and a bathtub (separate) which was also a nice touch but the water pressure left a lot to be desired. All in all, no complaints but we probably wouldn't stay here again. Just too many nice hotels all in the same area and unless you're in Paris for some reason other than touristy, the hotel and the hotel room are both low on your list of things to do and see in Paris.", "Date": "May 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Hotel, in an Amazing location, in an AmazingCity\u201d", "Author": "Abubu10", "ReviewID": "UR14768777", "Content": "We used our marriott points to stay at this hotel for 6 nights and 7 days.

Although the Paris Marriott is quite nice, my expectations were not entirely fulfilled. My wife and I had gotten very spoiled by the other Marriott's along the way because we had access to the Executive Lounges due to my Platinum status in the Marriott Rewards program. The Paris Marriott does NOT have an Executive Level nor lounge, although Gold and Platinum members are treated to the breakfast buffet in the restaurant each day (value is 30 Euros each). Our room (328), while nicely appointed, but small. The floors do not have ice machines and we had to call down each time we needed a bucket. The carpet was somewhat worn in the room but everything else was in perfect working order. The bathroom was large and decorated very nicely, although the showerhead was mounted \"length-wise\", so the curtain had to be drawn in order to take a shower, otherwise the spray would flood the bathroom (go figure). The A/C was long to cool off the room, which I thought was odd given the overall size of the area to be cooled. The bed was comfortable but a bit on the soft side, as opposed to the firm side here in the U.S. The hotel is right between two metro stations, Franklin D. Roosevelt and George V ( pronounced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jorg Sank\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). I preferred using the George V station because it seemed a tad bit closer. We made extensive use of the Metro and purchased a 3 day pass, which was well worth it. We did not have lunch or dinner in the restaurant but noted extremely high prices when viewing the menu. Expect to pay well over $100 for dinner for 2, although I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure it would be a great meal. The prices at the lobby bar were also very high. The hotel location is probably the best in all of Paris, but the Champs-Elysees is just like Times Square. It's extremely crowded and very noisy. Those that get a room overlooking the boulevard may have major problems with noise. Our room was tucked away overlooking the courtyard and was exposed to street noise when the window was open. Once closed, it was completely quiet. There are mini-bars in each room but be careful because just touching an item may trigger a charge. We did not purchase anything from the bar during our stay but used the bar to store drinks we bought on the outside. Just the placement of our items in the fridge triggered a few charges on our bill, which were immediately removed by staff with no questions asked. A physical inventory each day would be nice to prevent erroneous charges such as this. Be prepared to enter a smoke cloud when entering the lobby from the street. We had a non-smoking room. The only way to sit down to a computer is by purchasing time in the Business Center located in the lobby (I think internet access was 10-15 Euro's an hour). Right down the street at 66 Champs Elysees was an Internet center that cost 8 Euro's per hour. The hotel does not have a gift shop, but down the street, one block to the left (when exiting the lobby), is a store called Monoprix. The lower level has a well stocked grocery store. Housekeeping was good as was the front desk staff. The concierge's were very helpful and friendly. At no time did we experience any snobbery at all, each one of the staff were very friendly and spoke English fluently. Taxi fare to/from De Gaulle airport was exactly 40 Euros ($53.60) each way. Getting to the hotel by subway is a bit complicated and not convenient when traveling with heavy luggage due to very few escalators in the system, and some stations are very deep resulting in lots of stairs. Air France does run a bus service, but the stop is at the Arch de Triumph at Charles de Gaulle Etoile and is a hefty walk, and uphill.

My problems with the hotel are the variabilty in rooms, each room is slightly different (we tried several and they were VERY accomodating to move us) and for a hotel that is this expensive, I feel that it is almost pot luck which room you get. You can get a good sized room or a small one, a room on the back alley (pretty noisy), courtyard or facing the lobby (last two are the best option so ask for that). You also have to ask for non smoking as many foreigners stay here and if smoking bothers you, the smoking rooms can be very strong smelling. The rooms are well appointed but I felt for the money, it could have been a little higher end. It is a very nice hotel and all in all, we did enjoy our stay. I don't think you will be dissapointed if you stay here but if your paying the full price because of the hotel location and name recomendation, I would also look at the hotels around Place Vendome and Opera.

The Marriott Champs-Elysees was close but no cigar. They started our stay on the wrong foot by delaying our check in process by four hours. The front desk was trying to be as hospitable as possible but there was no excuse for not allowing us to check into our selected room until 7:00 pm at night at a rate of 570 EUROS per night. Now I don't want to come across as unfair like some other reviewers. The hotel is very beautiful and the room is nice for European standards; however it was just too small for the price. The location was top notch, with an array of restaurants and shopping at a walking distance. Aside from the fantastic shopping on the street, one cannot go to Paris and not visit the historic bakery Laduree. Laduree is practically across the street and it is famous for their excuisite Parisian Macaroon cookies as well as a menu full of sweet delights. I highly recommend the dessert called \"Creme de Isphahan\". The best part of staying at this location was the fact that the street is alive well even after midnight. It was great to do all the sight seeing activities during the day and know that the avenue would be open with shops and restaurants well into the night. The hotel staff was good about telling us about the shows (Lido/Moulin Roge). They also provided us with information about open/closing times and ticket prices. The truth of the matter is that we loved the location but the hotel itself was not worth the price.

This has the Louvre right down at one end and the Arc D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Triomphe at the other. The prices at the Marriot do vary a huge deal over the course of the year based on when the major tourist season and major events, like Paris fashion week, take place. Overall the hotel is a very nice place to stay. However, it can be expensive with a room around 240 euros a night. I have always been staying there as I have been attending meetings being run at the hotel. The bedrooms are a good size, not huge but a decent size, and feature the fantastic Marriot beds, loads of pillows and comfy duvet. The beds are something that everyone who has not stayed at the hotel comment on. They almost all look out over the back of the building so have no real view. But they are very quiet as a result. The bathrooms are also pretty good with decent sized bath and separate shower. The mini bar is, like all mini bars, well stocked and costly. There is a large restaurant that is ok with breakfasts costing about 22 euros for Continental and 26 for American. This seems a lot, and so worth trying to get a bed and Breakfast rate if you are the breakfast type! There is a lobby bar with very friendly staff that is right in the middle of reception so alright for meeting people before heading out, but not suitable as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153destination\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bar.

So, if you are an Arab American you will fit right in. I asked for a quiet room and we were put above the ballroom where on our first night a Wedding party rocked until 3:30am. We were assured that there were no other functions planned during our stay. The second night there was another party and we were up until 3:30am. We then got moved for the rest of our stay to the \"most quiet spot\" in the hotel. It was pretty quiet until our last night where there was a party going on next to us and a party above us and yelling in the courtyard. The rooms are clearly not very soundproofed. Overall, the service was good, the people were pleasant and language wasn't too much of a barrier. However, I was very surprised that they did nothing to make up for the inconvenience of the noise. Also, the concierge could only recommend one nice restaurant (L'Appert??) -which turned out to be just OK. We asked for alternatives and were told that was the only nicer one they knew of. Very odd. We found some very delicious restaurants on our own by walking towards George V. The room was a typical hotel room, nothing impressive - but we did have plenty of room for our clothes and it was nice to have AC after a hot day sight seeing.
