It was a random, piercing noise,sounding like a whistle. It made sleeping quite difficult. Complained to the front desk and at first no one understood what it was but finally someone said, \"Oh, that's the elevator\". What good is a comfy room when you need to buy earplugs and sleeping medicine for rest? They offered to move me the last night in the evening which I resisted as I was checking out in the morning to go to another city. Packing, repacking and unpacking seemed as stressful and we figured out to use earplugs and drugs for sleep. I suggested they give me a break on my bill and they declined. Not very hospitable as why pay for a hotel room that you can't sleep? They just didn't seem accomodating.

But a minor incident occurred during breakfast on our departing day. It was 9.30 am and the breakfast room was not crowded at all. The service however was rather slow with the lady in dark suit (manager on duty?) busying around the room with no smile, no greeting. We had to request for coffee many times before she came to attention. The last time I asked for milk (it should have come as a set with our coffee) she said \"wait\" without a glance at us and never returned (there was no milk nor coffee/tea on the buffet table and everybody had to make the request). She seemed to be paying more attention to some other chores than our simple request. Put it simply, she totally disregarded us and intentionally busying herself with something else. Finally, we were saved by a young, nice and smiling assistant who quickly brought what we needed. The incident at the breakfast room did spoil our initial impression about the hotel.

This was my second visit to Paris and having done many of the tourist stops on the first go round, my focus during this stay was on pure relaxation. I must say Hotel Tremoille was the PERFECT choice for me. The location as commented in prior posts is great. It is close to almost everything of interest to the average tourist. The room (a superior on the fifth floor) was also perfection. Large by Paris standards, a wonderful view of the surrounding neighborhood and when on the balcony, the top of the Eiffel tower was visible. The balcony ran the length of the room and if it had not been freezing I can imagine it would be very special. The bathroom was as described with a nice variety of Molton Brown products to sample. I will differ with the prior post which stated there is no high speed internet-not true. Not only is there high speed interet (both LAN and wifi), but it is FREE!!! Now onto the truly special part of this hotel- the service from the everyone was exceptional. From check-in where the receptionist showed the room, but also inquired whether I had a laptop and upon my replying yes, provided the login sheet (also available at the front desk) for the free wifi connection. Upon returning to my room after exploring the surrounding area, there was a lovely bottle of champagne with a note welcoming me. I have to make special mention of the hotel restaurant/lounge/bar Louis2- it was the highlight of my stay. Returning each evening to the warm, cozy atmosphere of the lounge was truly special. They mix a great raspberry martini and unlike other places in Paris, the portions were generous. Also the waitstaff are helpful without being intrusive. You could literally sit for hours with one drink of five (wouldn't recommend five). I can't really comment on the food, as I often had light snacks with my \"beverage\", but the fries were delicious. So having travelled to many locations and stayed at mostly five-star hotels, I rank Tremoille up with the best as it truly makes you feel at home.

Needless to say this is my favourite hotel in Paris. The Tremoille is located at a stone\u2019s throw of the Champs Elysees and Avenue George V, just by the Four Seasons hotel, in an area Parisians call the \u00ab Golden Triangle \u00bb. This is the home of luxury brands such as LVMH, Prada, Gucci, Valentino, DVF, Cartier, Rolex, Bulgari and the likes that all have shops or headquarters close by. The area also displays some excellent restaurants, like the starred Michelins Le Cinq at the George V or Alain Ducasse at the Plaza Athenee, Asian style Ginger and Indian Ratn further down on rue de la Tremoille, trendy Bound on George V or Maison Blanche on Avenue Montaigne. The hotel itself is on the corner of rue de la Tremoille and rue du Boccador, set in two reconverted Haussmannian residential buildings with all the old school charm and grandeur that goes with it : high ceilings, majestic staircase, fireplaces, large windows, and small balconies on rooms/suites on the 2nd and 5th floors. The bar and restaurant have been revamped last year and are a good place for a pre-dinner cocktail. There\u2019s a good business centre and a small gym. The hotel rooms have been recently decorated in a contemporary style that goes very well with the building style, bathrooms are spacious and well equipped, all rooms have a safe, flat screen TVs and DVD players, radio, mini bar, etc. The best point is the \u00ab hatch \u00bb: you can order your room-service/breakfast and ask for it to be placed on the hatch. The waiter would then open a pane on the outside of the room, knock on your door and go away. You can then open the pane on the inside of your room, retrieve your order and have a peaceful moment savouring your meal and reading the papers without seeing anyone. This is particularly convenient if you travel frequently and miss the intimacy of your mornings or don\u2019t feel like making much presentation effort before the caffeine injection. And this point actually sets the tone for the place: fantastic attention to detail, amazing customer service, discreet yet efficient staff and a well-connected concierge who can get you pretty much anything you want. Price wise, this is five-star luxury for a four star rate. In a word, I wouldn\u2019t stay anywhere else.

First let me say that the property is pretty and very well kept, but the rooms are standard size for Paris. There was enough room, but not an over abundance of space. The bathroom was well-appointed and a good size. First off, the hotel was helpful when we called to ask if we could check in early after our 6:30am flight arrival. My mom's room was lovely, but I didn't like ours. I gently told the front desk that I was disappointed, and we were whisked to a new room that was just right. Each time we came in and out of the hotel, we were greeted like royalty. The concierge made several reservations and provided fantastic guidance. On day two, my mom slipped and hurt herself enough to require a doctor's visit. The concierge was quick to call a doctor who arrived within a couple hours for a house (hotel) call. All I could think of was how complicated it would be, and the hotel took care of it in an instant. The concierge couldn't have been more helpful or more concerned. When we checked out, I asked to speak with the charming hotel director who graciously accepted my thanks for an excellent visit. One more bit--I managed to leave behind a drawer full of clothes.

Adequate but furnished with Ikea type furniture. Not exactly Plaza Athenee quality when you're paying 1400 euros a night. What was inconceivable was the treatment we received. On our first night I got a panicked cell phone call from my son saying he and his friend were stuck in the elevator between floors. He said they had tried the alarm in the elevator but just heard a recording in French. I rushed down to the lobby and told the concierge who said the alarm when to a company outside the hotel and someone would come. He wasn't more specific. I went up to where my son said they were trapped (they had been in there around 30 minutes by now) and heard them calling out. I tried to pull open the doors, and with the help of a hotel employee who was walking by we managed to pry it open enough for the two boys to squeeze out. Over the next three days I expected the management of the hotel to at least apologize for the ordeal we went through and the fact that children had been put at risk. Nothing, no comment at all, until the last day when, immediately after I had paid the large bill (and after they had to take some charges off the bill which they agreed were wrong), I was approached by a man standing nearby who introduced himself as the general manager. Instead of thanking me or apologizing for the malfunctioning elevator, he said that I had caused damage to the elevator by opening the door and was responsible for paying to repair it.

It is not a large hotel, but it is big enough to enable a stay there to be discrete, if that is what you desire. The hotel is family owned and was renovated beautifully to the very highest standards a few years ago. The building is the corner of a beautiful block in the 8th Arondissement, just round the corner from the George V Hotel, the Champs Elysees, etc. One of the delight of the hotel is its characterful rooms which are all slightly different in layout according to their position in the hotel. This makes your trip to your room an unusual and delightful voyage of discovery. The staff are, of course, French which means that their service can sometimes seem slightly offish, but it is really just the French way. The rooms are plush, renovated beautifully throughout whilst retaining lovely features such as the little serving cupboard that allows items to be delivered to your room without anyone having to enter.

The style of the hotel is really nice with it being that cosy mix of traditional deco with modern touches which I think is hard to find in Paris-you normally get one or the other. The location is spot on if you like to designer shops with Gucci, Dior, LV and of course the Champs Elysee all in walking distance. All in all a great time at a great hotel!", "Date": "January 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cStylish.

Coming from NYC we definitely notice when thought is put into interior design. We stayed in one of the two-level rooms which was perfect for one of us working on the computer downstairs (Free Internet a PLUS) while the other could rest in the bedroom upstairs. Cool leopard print here and there, great fabrics and comfy beds. Our friends who stayed on another floor had an incredible corner room with fabulous window overlooking rue de La Tr\u00e9moille. We were pleasantly surprised that their room had a completely different design \u2013 equally as fashionable. We never stay in this part of Paris, but now that we found this fabulous spot we'll be back for sure. Our experience with the service was excellent.", "Date": "December 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lagos, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cloved it! but don't bother with the breakfast\u201d", "Author": "SamG2004", "ReviewID": "UR3941994", "Content": "I stayed here for 2 nights on business. It's a great hotel - I personally loved the deco in the room. I could have happily spent hours there, it was really welcoming. And sounds daft maybe, but it had a really lovely velvet-like carpet that made it so nice to get out of bed in the morning. And the bathroom, complete with Molton Brown products, was awesome! If I stayed again I wouldn't bother with breakfast. It's not a buffet, so \u20ac22 just for coffee, juice and a basket of pastry is way too much.", "Date": "September 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but a bit pricey\u201d", "Author": "fcchelsea", "ReviewID": "UR3837992", "Content": "I combined a work trip with a long weekend in Paris and as my company uses the Tremoille as one of its corporate hotels my partner and I decided to stay there for our whole trip. As has been said before the location of this hotel is great. It is far enough away from the Champs d'Elysee to be quiet but near enough to be able to get to most of the main tourist spots either on foot or by metro. We had a superior room which was plenty big enough for the two of us and much larger than the usual European hotel. The bathroom was great with a full size bath which is essential for any British traveller along with a good shower and great Molson Brown toiletries. The bed was huge and I quite liked the faux bearskin rug that covered it. My one complaint about the room would be the lack of a table which would have been handy when eating a room service breakfast. On the whole the staff were very pleasant, particularly the ladies who made up the room and the lady on reception. The porter was a bit frosty and also corrected our French (and not in a good way) but maybe he was just having a bad day. We didn't eat in the restaurant as we wanted to find somewhere with a bit of choice for vegetarians which is definitely a bit of a mission in Paris where no meal seems to be complete without meat, fish or seafood. Overall I would recommend this hotel for a short trip to Paris if you want to push the boat out.", "Date": "September 2, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel de la Tremoille", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d228801-Reviews-Hotel_de_la_Tremoille-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$420 - $620*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">14, rue de la Tremoille</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75008</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514938", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/59/2d/592d6ccdf12fa10f5a620757fc6a307c4large.jpg"}}
