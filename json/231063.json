The Monna Lisa has a very good location for the right bank, about two blocks off the Champs Elysees and one block from the metro (St Philippe du Roule station, although other stops are just a short further walk). The rooms are on the small side, however they are not uncomfortably small or an unusually small size for Paris. If you are travelling alone for business, the Monna Lisa is a very nice, well-priced option (less than EUR 200), and also I believe a couple would be happy in this hotel for one or two nights, especially if you are out sight-seeing a lot and do not need to spend a tremendous amount of time in your room. I would say that if you have a lot of luggage, want a bathtub or like to spend a lot of time in your hotel room, then this is probably not the hotel for you. If you want an American-style, larger room with two double/queen beds on the right bank then I suggest you look at the Hotel Sofitel Paris Arc de Triomphe, 3 Rue de l'\u00c9toile, 75017. The refurbished rooms are clean and amazingly well designed to maximize the space. Coffee and tea are free in the lobby, and the staff are friendly and helpful. The lobby is furnished tastefully in a modern style (as are the rooms) with lots of chic art and photography books displayed about. My room rate included breakfast, which featured scrambled eggs, sausage and bacon, not just croissants. However, the breakfast does not have an abundant amount of choices, if this is important to you. Rooms are quiet and have free wifi, comfortable beds with nice pillows, speakers for your iPod/iPhone, a flat screen TV with quite a few channel choices (although CNN is the only 24 hour English-speaking one). Temperature controls were good. If you are over 6 ft tall the shower would probably feel cramped. All in all, a good value and I would stay here again.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antwerp, Belgium", "Title": "\u201ctop location\u201d", "Author": "belgonur", "ReviewID": "UR120549826", "Content": "TOP location very small room comfy bed very helpful staff the place dont look like a hotel from outside the bathroom wasNOT very clean 1min walk to metro stop if u get a good deal dont miss it.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot bad....\u201d", "Author": "me201037", "ReviewID": "UR87888843", "Content": "Excellent location!! Hotel is very small, 4 rooms per floor. We had a deluxe room which was a nice size with a nice sized bathroom. Only thing was the bed. Very flat pillows and no duvet.

Very comfortable, well designed and clean. Location is very convenient - just off the Champs Elysees and 10 mins from L'Etoile. The restaurant was closed during our stay there (which we knew about before) but open for breakfast. Its a small, great, simple and stylish hotel - with nice rooms. All of the focus has gone on the rooms and the restaurant - the small reception area and the landings are unimpressive - BUT you're not spending any time there. If you are after a big hotel, with large lobby area and tons of facilities - then look elsewhere. Would definitely recommend.

This is mainly a restaurant with handful of rooms on top. The rooms are small, nicely decorated but very basic. Nothing extra can be found in these rooms. Basically they are great if you want to be right off the Champ Elysees and only sleep in your room. No mini bar. Small TV. This hotel is so small that it actually doesn't have a lobby or corridors. You come out of your room and there is the elevator and other 2 rooms doors! The location is great. In the middle of Champ Elysees buzz and close to bars and restaurants. If you want to hop into metro, its right there on Champ Elysees. We had dinner around the hotel and the pasta restaurant around the corner was really nice. The service is good if you can call it service. There is only one person sitting behind a desk that you can call concierge (remember there is no lobby). She and he were both really nice and as the hotel is so small they remember you and answer your questions with effort. I can't complain about the service as they always responded with a huge smile!

First impressions were disappointing. There isn't a reception desk...for a supposed 4* hotel you would expect one. However there a small table with a welcoming smile. The various receptionists (we saw 4 in 2 days) were all EXTREMELY helpful, courteous and kind. They went beyond their receptionist duties. This is what really counted. After about 10 mins we were given our key cards and went up to our rooms on the 1st floor....TINY is the word I'd use to describe them. We had read someone's review about the 'super jet shower,'....There was a jet shower but the water just dribbled out. It wasn't all that! Once we got over the shock of the size of the rooms we wandered out to explore...The Champs Elysees is a mere 3 minute walk away - An ideal location. Once you get to the Champs Elysees you need to turn right and you can see the Arc de Triomphe (also the nearest metro station there)...about a 10 min walk. If you're there for the weekend, I'd recommend the red open top double decker buses than the metro. It's a 2 day pass and you can hop on, hop off. The buses run very frequently, but note the exact location of the bus stops. Overall summary, the Monna Lisa is more of a 2/3 star hotel with a 5 star service. The staff are extremely helpful, especially the breakfast staff, who go out of their way to cater for your every need. A quick note on the breakfast: fresh orange juice, a choice of hot drinks (capuccino, tea, hot choc), sweet croissants, buns, dried meat, cheese, cereal, fruit salad). If you want a real 4 star hotel don't stay here. If you want a comfortable bed for the night and want to be right in the centre of the city and get great advice/tips on sight seeing stay here. It's cheaper than other hotels in the area. Would I recommend the Monna Lisa? Yes, for the location. There are 4 bedrooms on one floor. The rooms are very small, especially the ones left of the elevator. The 2 rooms in front of the elevator are bigger. The room on the right of the elevator is a twin room and is okish in size. Would I stay again? Maybe if I got the bigger room. Would I pay an extra 30 Euro per night for a bigger hotel in a real 4 star? Yes Hope you found this helpful. At the end of the 2 days we had had a lovely time in Paris and due to the great smiling faces at the hotel forgot about the size of the room!
