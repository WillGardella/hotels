The hotel is located in the Pont de l'Alma/Champs Elys\u00e8es area which is an excellent neighborhood. The Avenue Montaigne is the next street over and is probably more glamorous of a shopping address than Rodeo Drive. The Champs Elys\u00e8es is about 5 minutes away and you can virtually see the Eiffel Tower from the hotel. The service was excellent. I heard them speak English, Spanish, Italian and French while we were there. The room is small but that is to be expected of any major international city. You should only be sleeping and showering in there anyways. The bathroom was nice and clean with a warm shower and the bed was very comfortable after a long day of exploring the city. There are a few cafes in the area but not a ton of restaurants so go towards Champs Elys\u00e8es or across the bridge to the Champs-deMars area which is where we went and found some great local French restaurants. To get to the hotel from CDG airport Terminal 2 via the metro follow the signs for the RER (Paris by Train) in the airport to the main station. In the main station go to the glass room that says 'Billet lle-de-France' (Tickets Paris). They have service people that speak English and ask for your roundtrip tickets on the RER to Pont del'Alma. They should cost about \u20ac14 per person round trip. (You can also purchase a visitor pass to ride any train, any time for about \u20ac50 a person). Take the RER B to the Saint-Michel station and then switch to the RER C and get off at the Pont de I'Alma\u200e station. The hotel is about 300 meters (5 min walk) from the train station. Overall a great place and recommended by a frequent European traveler. If you can get a great price then stay there. We paid \u20ac160 a night which was about \u20ac70 less then everything near it at that time.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "lankk97", "ReviewID": "UR122181204", "Content": "We reached the hotel exhausted because we had to carry our heavy luggage up and down the stairs at the Paris metro (No escalators at most of the metro stations!!!).

The girl at the reception (i think her name was Maria) was very nice and welcoming. She gave us a map and explained how to get around Paris when she found out that it was our first time there. Since our room did not come with breakfast, she suggested I join as a Melia member so we can get the 2nd person breakfast at 50% off. The elevator to the room is tiny but the room is of decent size.

When I arrived at the hotel, the doorman held the swing door open for me, rather than take my luggage from me which was bizarre. The reception staff were efficent enough, but not particularly welcoming. The first room I was allocated was compact, and the bathroom arranged in such a way that one had to do gymnastics to exit the bath/shower without brushing up against the loo. I am not one who normally complains about hotel beds being too hard, but this one was virtually indistinguishable from sleeping on the floor, also it was made up with blankets rather than a duvet which is something I haven\u2019t seen for many years. When I called housekeeping, they advised that they did not have duvets in any rooms so could not assist. Around 11pm when trying to sleep, I could hear a conversation from the neighbouring room, eventually I managed to get to sleep, only to be woken up at 2.30am by the neighbour having a telephone conversation. What I must stress is that this individual was talking at normal volumes, so the problem lies purely with thin, poorly insulated walls between rooms. At 11pm I had called down and the receptionist advised that they will ask the neighbouring individual to stop their conversation, I told them that that was ridiculous as it was not as if they were shouting! The next day I complained and was upgraded to a \u201csuperior\u201d room which only had a neighbour on one side and proved to be quieter. Also, this room was made up with a duvet, despite my having been told previously that they only had blankets! Something to note about both rooms is the extremely loud air-conditioning fan noise, there is no way one would be able to sleep with the air-con on. The bar area always closed early, before 10pm each evening, and the \u201crestaurant\u201d was solely a breakfast room. Room service seemed to be non-existent as no menu was placed in the rooms. Quite how this hotel is rated four star when there is no restaurant baffles me. A nice touch was the provision of two carafes of water made freely available in the lobby, one \u201cscented\u201d with lemon, the other with mint. This is something that reminds me of Ritz-Carlton style service, although, this was the only thing there that did! I booked this hotel using a \u201csecret\u201d type web-site so paid 60% less than the very best available rate at the time of booking. If you can secure this property for less than circa EUR120 per night then it provides a very central base in Paris, otherwise you can do far better for your money. It is a Spanish chain and there were lots of Spanish coach parties staying there, so I am sure no one is paying published rates.", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tehran, Iran", "Title": "\u201cClose to everywhere... what a location\u201d", "Author": "Amirhossein79", "ReviewID": "UR58633151", "Content": "What a location for this 4 star hotel...

The rooms are no frills but comfortable. The lobby is great, with couches for lounging and hanging out. There is a small bar too, and you can get an expresso or a cocktail throughout the day. The breakfast is expensive and pretty unremarkable. However, it was still nice to have a meal and then go out for the day without worrying about finding a bite to eat. There are a number of cafes and fresh produce markets around as well. I'm a weird eater so I usually stick to simple eating when i'm abroad. It's easy to get a cheese and tomato baguette at a cafe here or a margherita pizza. You can walk to the Eiffel Tower early in the morning ( go about an hour before it opens and you'll be in and out before the lines start) and then you can hop on the double decker bus right in front of the tower in order to hit The Louvre etc. GREAT hotel!

PROS: First, this is neither the Four Seasons or the Plaza Athenee--nor does it try to be. (Although both are about 2-3 blocks away, which sort of gives you the idea, along with Prada, Loro Piana, etc., of the neighborhood.) It is a boutique hotel...small and intimate. We were there during the World Cup matches and quite a few people gathered before the large plasma TV in the first floor lounge (with a small but effective bar) to watch some games. It was like watching with a bunch of friends. and when people entering or leaving walked by through the lobby, they would stop, watch a few minutes, talk and then be on their way. There are rooms that face the small, quiet street, and some that look into an interior courtyard. We had a room with a King looking to the interior. It was remarkably quiet for being a block from Aves. George V and Montaigne. The birds chirping were the loudest thing we ever heard. The room was of good size for a small hotel. With the King, there was adequate walking room on both sides, and at the foot of the bed a small couch. Beyond that a writing desk, small table (good for eating room service) and an armoire with safe, tv, small refrig, and luggage stand. Plenty of room for two people. well lit, very good A/C with variable fan and lots of outlets. I like outlets. This was Room 307. The decor was French fancy with gilded mouldings and nice wallpaper. Three of the best items about the room were: (1) has REALLY thick, heavy doors which block all noise -- even between the room and bath. (2) Has an 'airlock' type of entry into the room. Heavy outside door with bolting lock, small hall before room with double closet with mirrors, and another big door into room. Superb sound control. (3) Hard bed. I hate mushy French beds. This one was, happily, firm -- and they had a pillow menu for American wimps like me. Bath had been redone in past couple of years so was largely new. Had Grohe fixtures, a marble inlaid floor and double sinks. Great pressure and lots of HW. They had a good hairdryer, and when asked brought an ironing board and iron which we kept the full time. It fit nicely under the bed. Since my wife was working every day and I was on vacation, I slept in and didn't leave until Noonish on some days. The maids were really great generally and especially about this! No knocking, no dirty looks for sxrewing up their schedules. I'd let them know I was going to be out for a bit, and the room would be ready as soon as I got back. Getting really good, consistent service for 8 days is worth a remark. The food and room service situation is a bit confusing in the written descriptions, so let me clear this up. The Hotel has a cute breakfast-only restaurant with an enclosed courtyard area--just off the main entrance hall as you walk through to the elevators. It serves until 10:30am. There is also room service from 6 am until 10:30 am. On several days we left the choice on the door handle and breakfast appeared within 8 minutes of the time indicated. The menu is not large, but it would serve for in-room meals as needed. The food was all very good. The breakfast is additional to the room charge and is fairly elaborate--25 Euros either in the restaurant or the room. On most days i just wandered up to the Champs and got some pasteries and OJ for 6-7 Euros. Hard to eat a big breakfast after a huge dinner at 10pm. Which brings up the location. It is about 8 blocks up along Ave. Montaigne to Rond Pont. It is right at the Alma Bridge (close to the Eiffel Tower) and a 1 minute walk to the Metro. Alma-Marceau. If you haven't been in Paris before this is a perfect location along the major tourist axis. You can walk to the Tower, Trocadero, and the Louvre. Its a bit touristy in the sense that many Americans are in this area--but it is definately upscale. We have a cousin that lives in Montparnasse, near the Gare, and that is more neighborhoodish.... The staff speak English but one or two not highly complex English. Certainly sufficient for 90% of complex issues, and willing to work with you. They were polite and helpful. But it is a small staff, and the entrance desk area is too small and can get overrun. You have to pass through it to get into the main lobby-lounge area and elevator. That having been said, they were nice to us and everything was efficient and accurate. CONS. First, when I call a hotel and ask if they have Internet Access, I should specify what type. They have a computer in the lobby that is broadband and costs 15 Euros for an hour of time. But no in-room WiFi. I'm told that this is still not unusual in Paris, but the choice of an expensive telephone dialup line and a single 15 Euros per hour computer does not do it for me. I hope they put in WiFi. (Moreover, the SFR WiFi card was almost useless -- not the hotel's fault, this was bought separately--as well. It was back to McDonalds where it was free, fast and there was a shake and some fries.) So it was a 10 miunte walk to use my computer at length--although I did buy 1 hour for quick email checks and that lasted the week, and that worked out well. Second, and this may just be me, they have a small room off the main desk area, for waiting I suppose. But they should move the Reception desk into there and make that initial entry area bigger. That room is beautiful, of good size and unused. I feel sorry for the poor managers--they are quite good, but that is not the best set-up. I believe the physical layout leads to a sense of there being more of a flurry than there really is. The closer setting is nice when entering and leaving when there are not things going on--or luggae coming or going--it is nicely intimate....but the trade-off suggests a revised floorplan. Third, like a lot of older French buildings that have been modernized, the elevator is small. 4 people would be tight. 2 people with bags. No way to change it, and my cousin's building has one about the same size for a much larger population. Fourth, I would have given up the space given to the nice luggage stand in exchange for a few extra drawers, although it was adequate. Also, there were a few minor dings to the wallpaper and such that could be fixed in about 20 minutes--might as well since everything else is so well maintained and nice. CONCLUSION. I would highly recommend this place without hestitation. If you are trying to save money, get your breakfast the night before or stroll out to a bakery. ps. a new exhibition at the just re-opened L'Orangerie (a smallish museum near the Louvre) of Monet's water lillys in the round is spectacular. if you are going to be in Paris for a few days, buy a Pass Musee, go past the lines at most museums...see this.)

Second, I booked and paid for a higher level room with a king bed and was put in a lower level room with twins. They rectified this after the first night, and put us into a small suite to make up for the mistake. Not much to the common areas, and they reeked of smoke. (Though it is Paris, I guess.) We avoided the breakfast and headed out to the cafes as they were a better value. Overall, we had a wonderful time in Paris. The location made up for any minor inconveniences we experienced.

Don't bother staying at this so called \"boutique\" hotel. There was absolutely nothing boutique about it at all. It was dirty, noisy, and cheap looking. Our stay went down hill the minute we walked into the lobby to check-in. First, the receptionist was collating personal documents of other guests (i.e. photocopies of passports, credit cards, etc.) at the front desk for all to see and perhaps steal. Throughout the entire check-in process, and with other random guests hovering around the front desk area she didn't think once to protect any of the personal guest information that she had strewn about the counter - she even walked away from the documents several times. Absolutely no security at all. And second, it took her several minutes to greet us and to even acknowlege us because she was too busy collating documents. The front lobby, common seating area w/bar, and dining area look like something out of a cheap motel rather than a 4-star \"boutique\" hotel. And there is no concierge, and reception was less than willing to dispense any tourist or restaurant information. The rooms are even worse. The first room we stayed in smelled heavy of cigarette smoke (although we specifically asked for a non-smoking room). The bathroom was not only disgustingly dirty but so small that you had to close the entry door in order to open the shower door. And the door stop for the bathroom was on the floor directly in front of the toilet so we kept tripping on it. The beds were 2 twins pushed together so we kept falling in between as we slept. The walls are paper thin so you can hear conversations, TV's, and bathroom noise from other guest rooms as if they were in your room with you. It was just awful. We asked to be moved to see if the problem with the noise was guest specific. It didn't help, the next room was just as bad - I actually had to purchase ears plugs in order to get any sleep. They do have double-paned windows but they were worthless - the windows might as well have been open. The hotel is on a one way street so you think it would be quiet. No, garbage and delivery trucks driveby in the early a.m. so the external noise is pretty bad if your room faces the street. Both rooms were equally bad. There were spider webs on the walls, carpets were stained, toilets were disgusting, shower was bad: water temp fluctuated and pressure was weak, beds were very hard and they gave you only one very long and hard pillow to share, linens are 2nd rate, no alarm clock, some light fixtures and phones did not work, furniture needs updating and steam cleaning, wall paper peeling up. And just to make our stay even worse, we found a playboy magazine in the room. And every morning, you can smell the cigarette smoke and food wafting up the stairwell and permeating throughout the halls and into the guest rooms. Please, do yourself a favor and stay away from this hotel.", "Date": "April 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge UK", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced and nothing special\u201d", "Author": "UK-CB4", "ReviewID": "UR4078877", "Content": "I fail to see what's so \"boutique\" about this hotel. Boutique hotels usually have something special and different about them - this one is simply a (generally) comfortable hotel. We had a reasonable room - but the bathroom was a total disaster. The toilet was so jammed between the shower screen and the wall that I couldn't actually sit on it! Even for Paris that's quite an achievement - and a world first for me! The bath was also downright dangerous - neither my partner nor I were able to step into it without slipping or overbalancing. The room was comfortable - but it was not the non-smoking room the receptionist had assured us it would be - not with ashtrays and matches on the dek, and the small balcony littered with cigarette butts; it clearly hadn't been swept for weeks. Frankly, we dislike being lied to. The minibar prices were quite outrageous, and 25 Euros each for breakfast verges on extortion. On the Sunday morning, practically nothing was left (apart from the bacon swimming in grease). Staff were very unknowledgeable - they could only recommend one nearby restaurant (very ordinary) and could not answer simple \"typical tourist\" questions.
