Relocating to the area, I choose this Best Western to stay for a few nights. After moving into my new apartment and unpacking I found my makeup bag, some costume jewelry and a Los Angeles Book missing. I called and was told that nothing was left behind. After 2 more weeks I started to notice that several of my daughters t-shirts were missing. I guess they were hoping because I had 6 large bags it would take my awhile to miss the items. I know that they stole the first items because the hotel was the last place I saw them. This hotel and personnel horrible.

I had had such a good stay at the Best Western Canoga Park Motor Inn that I stayed again and I had the same great experience. The hotel seems a bit out of the way but it is pretty central to freeways and is easy to find once you have been there. Parking is ample, breakfast is very generous and staff always friendly and helpful.Hotel is clean. It is close to a convention area but you would never know it and I never hear any noise even when I have stayed in room close to desk and main floor.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington state", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel for price and location\u201d", "Author": "sunnyWashingtonstate", "ReviewID": "UR115775978", "Content": "I needed a hotel close to my son and couldn't find any I could afford. I found the site for the BW Canoga Park Motor Inn and almost did not book cause I loved the price but I wasn't sure of the location and thought it would be noisy being next to a convention center, bowling alley and resturant. I was truly amazed how comfortable and quiet this hotel was. It took me a bit longer to get there but it was worth it. The front staff was helpful and friendly and other stafff members were also. There was a good variety of food for breakfast. There was plenty of parking which if you have stayed in LA and areas, parking is a issue. The room was clean and comfortable and I will say again, quiet. Don't pass this hotel up.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salinas, CA", "Title": "\u201cUnique opportunity for 24 hour entertainment\u201d", "Author": "Three-men-and-a-babe", "ReviewID": "UR105722904", "Content": "This hotel is connected to a 24 hour bowling alley. It's not much to look at from the outside, but we had a very pleasant stay. Our room was very clean and quiet. We were there on a Wednesday night. It had a fridge and a microwave. The staff were very friendly. The breakfast area was very small. But they managed to pack in plenty of choices which included hard-boiled eggs, biscuits and gravy, hot and cold cereals, fruit and pastries. It was a little too chilly the morning we were there to eat outsid. But I did see tables next to small koi pond. We didn't have time to use the small pool, jacuzzi, or bowling alley.

Front desk check-in was friendly & efficient, the room clean & quiet. Although this is an older facility it appeared to be recently renovated and in excellent condition. My old eyes particularily liked the crisply new, well lit bathroom! Has all the necessities: In-room coffee, microwave, fridge, wi-fi (get log-in info from the desk), a decent continental breakfast, pool, etc. No on-site restaurant but there are several near-by. There is an adjoining bowling alley which boasts a cocktail lounge, though. Price was competitive in the area and we got a further discount by booking on-line.

Just be sure to lock your car and remove valuables from sight... That said, our room was surprisingly nice. Come to think of it, the whole hotel stood out from its surroundings (in a good way!) We were a little surprised, however, to find out that the elevator wasn't working. Had to haul all of our heavy luggage up the stairs (which we had to be careful not to touch because of the wet paint signs). Hopefully, we just caught the hotel at a bad time.

For breakfast, we were given vouchers for an adjacent restaurant which was very good. We chose from the special voucher menu, but you can choose any breakfast you like and pay the difference. If you forget something, complimentary toiletries are available. Parking is very close to entrance, which is monitored with a security camera. Don't let the bowling alley put you off.

It was beautiful and probably the cleanist one I've seen! I've traveled enough to be impressed. The area seemed middle class, but safe. For the rate, our room was perfect! Right by the pool where the kids spent alot of time. They also enjoyed the bowling alley next store every night, and the restaurant delivers and has wonderful food. The best part though was the staff. They were very friendly and personable. You could tell they all felt like family. We even met the owner of the place, who was equally friendly. The kids cried when we had to leave. They've alreadly been contacted by the friends they made there.
