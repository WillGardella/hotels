I usually associate the \"garden\" brand of Hilton to be the less (or no) frills version that competes with the other budget hotel chains. I was very pleasantly surprised by this lovely hotel. Rooms were spacious, very clean, and equipped with free WIFI. Bedding was luscious and comfortable. The hotel itself was full-service. But the best parts of the hotel were amenities you only associate with larger places....and with attached fees! There was a fully equipped office center with two PCs, printer/scanner and all sorts of desk supplies. The center was free to guests....including unlimited printing on hotel supplied paper! As the bride made several changes at the Friday evening rehearsal, it was such a gift to be able to incorporate those changes and print up new documents Saturday morning. As well, the hotel has a restaurant, which we were not expecting. The menu for breakfast and lunch is limited, but the hot food selections were delicious and very filling. When we returned Saturday afternoon after the wedding ceremony, the little restaurant was transformed into a lounge with bartender. Lovely little spot to sit and grab a drink or glass of wine. The seating was comfortable and welcomed groups, just like you would expect in a larger hotel's lounge/lobby. The wedding reception was held at the Garden Inn as well, and the banquet facilities were well thought out. Parking for guests was separate from hotel guest parking, and there was a direct entrance to the banquet wing. Food was well prepared, and well served. I would definitely stay here again, and was thrilled to find out this matched my expectations for a Hilton Hotel, as opposed to their Garden brand line.

We had to leave to go to dinner and they told us they would send somebody up to replace the towels and leave some toilet paper. When we returned at 11pm they had not done so. Two strikes. Second, we found bugs nesting in the window of our room. They were friendly lady bugs, and they were harmless, but it didn't make us feel like we had a clean room.

The king sized bed was verrrrry comfy, lots of pillows and was covered in luxorious linens. They also had a free business center and complimentary high speed internet access. The lobby & dining area are lovely and the food was delicious. There is also lots of close, free parking, a nice work-out room, pool and hot tub. The convention center is well laid out and I am looking forward to attending the Illinois PTA Convention here in April 2007.", "Date": "January 15, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hilton Garden Inn Champaign/ Urbana", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g35790-d90825-Reviews-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Champaign_Urbana-Champaign_Illinois.html", "Price": "$114 - $176*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1501 South Neil Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Champaign</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">IL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">61820</span></span> (Formerly Clarion)</span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514992", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/34/0b/340b9e1dd8b92f872ad81d89d36996184large.jpg"}}
