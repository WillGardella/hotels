The bed linens were luxurious; the view from the floor to ceiling windows in the bedroom and living room was terrific. The staff was outstanding. My daughter ended up sick... in the lobby and in our room for three days. The staff sent up a basket of fruit, a free movie, and asked about her when I went out. Room service from the Kids Menu was great. Negatives were daily charges for WiFi, having to ask at the front desk for a newspaper each day.

We were in a corner suite room, with the view of the water and downtown. We had an open sitting area, huge bathroom with a Jacuzzi and stand alone shower. Two flat screen TV\u2019s, king sized bed, curtains that black out any light.....need I go on?! We had room service for breakfast on both days; we received a special when booking, so it was included. On the first morning, our breakfast was a bit delayed (didn't bother us though as we were getting ready for the day); however when we got back to our room at the end of the day, the manager had sent over a bottle of wine and fresh fruit as an apology for the delay in the morning! Such a thoughtful display of how much they value their guests. The rooms were very clean, modern touchess of furniture and accents throught the hotel and rooms. The location is amazing, we were central to shopping, the Pikes Market....everything was in walking distance. This city is just amazing, clean, and safe (some areas to avoid of course, but that is in any city)...a cab ride at night takes less than 5 minutes to get anywhere....if you have plans on coming to Seattle, I would highly recommend this hotel!

The vallet parking is nice - our car was whisked away upon checkin and brought back to us when we checked out the next morning - no need to worry about parking downtown or theft or vandalism. The bellhop service was great - he unpacked our car, brought our cart up to our room, unloaded our luggage from the cart, hung up our coats, put our shoes in the closet, and showed us the tricks and treats of the room! There's a programmable safe in the closet, automatic window darkening shades at the press of a button, a door bell, and a snack bar & mini fridge (but everything is overpriced and the fridge is on sensors so if you even lift a $4 can of soda from the track, you pay for it!). The bathroom is huge with separate tub and shower, but the tub doesn't have jets. The lighting in the bathroom sucks though! I had to take a hand mirror to the window in the morning to get some daylight to put on my make-up. The dim, yellow light in the bathroom was disappointing. The bath amenitites are nice - good quality shampoo, soap, toothpaste, etc. There is even a real hairdryer for your convenience - not one of those mini ones hooked to the wall - but a real one! There is also an iron and ironing board in the closet if you should need it. Oh - and the coffee and tea is nice in the room - in the maker you can either run hot water through it for the tea or use the pre-packaged coffee trays to brew a cup. The bed was not very comfortable. Neither my husband or I slept well. The pillows are those horrible overstuffed down filled ones that are either too high or you sink down to the mattress. Save your neck - bring your favorite pillow from home! We didn't have time to use the hot tub...and note, there is not a pool at this hotel. Ruth's Chris Steakhouse in the hotel was nice for visiting with friends in the lounge area. We didn't eat there, just had drinks. There is a Starbuck's in the hotel too, so that's nice for breakfast! The hotel was very clean and we would stay here again. I only gave a \"very good\" rating because of the lack of pool, the horrible pillows and not very comfortable bed, the bad bathroom lighting, and the lack of jets in the bathtub.

The check-in staff was really great and helpful, when we checked out, but we ran into a little bit of a problem with some drinks that were listed in our bill (we didn't drink anything from the fridge). Apparently the fridge has a sensor, so when we move things around in the fridge (to make way for the delicious smoked salmon we bought from Pike's place - we were really careful about packaging the smoked salmon so it's practically odorless), it records the movement and thinks that we took some drinks out of the fridge. The matter was resolved by a very helpful lady at the check out (although the gentleman at the check-out desk was not very nice/helpful and gave me a bit of a sour face when we faced this issue at check-out).

The check-in staff was very friendly and efficient and had me on my way up to my room in short order. Off-street parking is convenient, though a bit pricey, with a parking garage located right behind the hotel. The rooms, while not large, are very comfortable. Much of the space was taken up by the bathroom which had an enormous shower plus a separate tub and expansive counter and sink. It seemed luxurious until I tried out the towels, which appeared to be made for a middle tier fitness club rather than a top notch hotel. The room was very quiet; I didn't notice any noise from adjoining rooms or the hallway, although I didn't see many people on my floor so I'm sure that helped. There were some other very nice touches such as electrically controlled window shade to block out the downtown lights and a lighted closet for hanging clothes. The king bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows to choose from. Besides the disappointing towels, the thing which made this less than a perfect night's stay was the WiFi connection. I'm always amazed that Holiday Inn Express can provide me with rock-solid WiFi for free, but a place like the Hyatt will charge at least $10 per night for flaky internet access. I even splurged for the \"Premium\" WiFi at $15 per night, and found it to be painfully slow. I gave up trying to get work done from my room and switched over to using my phone for basic web access.

We'd definitely stay again.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Camas, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat customer service\u201d", "Author": "ZaiZaiLv", "ReviewID": "UR122538081", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 nights for Christmas. Used the Hyatt points, but looking at the price listed, it is very reasonable, especially for such a great location and amenities. Customer Service: I have been a member of Hyatt for years, and I must say, I have never been as impressed by the customer service as at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. Normally, at more corporate hotel like this, you receive the more courteous type of customer service, more like \"I'm doing this because I have to, not because I want to\". But here, everyone is very friendly and seems generally happy to help. We were also greeted by our names, which hardly ever happens anymore in this type of hotel. In fact, after our stay, the Mr actually called the hotel to find out where they got their salmon served at the Grand Club was from and they actually contacted him back w/ the information. It was a simple gesture, but I have contacted other hotel to find information on something they served during our previous stay, and was ignored even though they're known for their excellent customer service. Room: We had a gorgeous view of the water from our room. The room itself is not too big, but not too small; very comfortable size for a hotel room. The bathroom however is not the typical Hyatt bathroom. It reminds me more of the Vegas hotels bathroom (think Bellagio, Wynn, etc). Loved the soak tub, and my request for bath salt was accommodated without any problems, although I am still confused as to why hotels w/ tubs don't provide bath salt/soap for this purpose without having to request it. You can't exactly use regular shower gel to take a bath. The bed is typical Hyatt bed, comfortable enough. However, the pillows are so flat we had to fluff them up by sleeping on two (three for me). I don't understand why hotels spend so much money on every other aspect of their hotels, except for the pillows. You spend most of your time on top of them, comfort is necessity! Location: you know what that say, location location location. Walking distance to pretty much everything. Granted Seattle is not that big and easily accessible, but this location is located in a perfect spot for tourists. You are literarily smacked in the middle of the shopping area when you walk out of the hotel, and just a short few blocks walk to Pike Place. It's only 1 or 2 block walk to the bus stop so hopping in and out of busses is not a problem at all. Fitness Center: I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the fitness center. Plenty of machines and selections. Minor incident which really wasn't the hotel's fault. Perhaps they should put up a big giant sign before the door to the hot tub area instead of the corner so everyone could see that proper attires are required to enter the area. Sure, it should be common knowledge that this area is coed, but apparently it is not common knowledge at all. We had the unpleasant incident w/ three women who let's just say not dressed for a coed area. It was uncomfortable for all, but especially for the Mr whose hot tubbing time was cut short w/ this incident. Grand Club: Okay, I've heard a lot of complaints about their Grand Club from another travel forum, so I wasn't expecting a lot. Sockeye salmon they served in the morning is the Mr's favorite (thus the calling the hotel for info on it). They don't serve hot food for breakfast, but honestly, I quite enjoy grabbing something quick here and having breakfast/lunch/brunch elsewhere later on. A lot of time, the breakfast served at the hotel isn't exactly the best quality anyway. The afternoon snack consists of hot appetizers, veggies and dips, and drinks. Not a lot of selections, but good enough for snacking purposes. Alcohol is extra, which we weren't aware of *not that it'd stop us from ordering, but it'd be nice if there's a sign to indicate that* (the last day, the magic sign was there; perhaps someone complained?). I must disclose that we had free access to the Grand Club because of my status. Not sure if I'd pay extra for it honestly. The view from the club was beautiful and the room was comfortable to hang out in, however, the food selection isn't worth how much you'd have to pay for. But since it's free for us, I can't complain much. In conclusion, we had a great stay, and we will definitely consider the Grand Hyatt next time we're in Seattle.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peterborough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgreat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "tila97", "ReviewID": "UR122483216", "Content": "stayed here xmas and nye 2011. loved it. we had suite on 28th floor overlooking awesome views. brill staff. food service was great. clean sheets and very tidy rooms. would stay here again. love it in winter times. so pretty.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cGreat rooms with a View\u201d", "Author": "Ghostrider5408", "ReviewID": "UR122405943", "Content": "One of my favorite hotels to stay at.

Hotel offered a \"shopping package\" for 199. The rate included 75 in gift cards to local retailers, free valet parking and an in room movie....A great deal, considering it drops the rate for the hotel room to under 100 easily. We booked a King Room, but did the Hyatt upgrade option that is available when you book a room. Ended up getting the upgrade to the Grand club floors and to an Executive suite The upgrade was well worth it. Executive suite had a separate sitting room with TV and wet bar, and single bath, and through french doors that lead to the bedroom. Standard work station (that lacked AC plug in on desk), and a gigantic closet and bathroom. Bathroom had separate toilet area, huge shower and gigantic soaking tub. Great amenities to spoil yourself with. Loved the room and and push button darkening blinds. Was glad we upgraded to the grand club floors as it provided complimentary evening snacks and reasonably priced adult beverages (5 bucks), plus a great morning breakfast spread. The club is open all day with coffee, soda and water and the folks working in it are awesome. Did not use the health club but took a look. Great set up plus a nice whirl pool. Images on web site are accurate, keep in mind that there is not a pool at this property. Check in, check out and Valet were flawless. Great public area staff that were spot on and did a great job. The only downer on the trip is related to the work station in the bedroom. It did not have plug ins on top of the desk, so was forced to plug two I-phone chargers into the wall outlet under the desk. We left the chargers by mistake and didn't realize to later in the evening after we checked out. I called the hotel and asked if they had found them. Was told that house keeping did not report any found items from the room, but that security would take a look in the room as it was vacant that evening. NO luck as they said the room was clean. That leaves only a few options. House keeping threw them in the trash, House Keeping put them in their pocket, or the hotel does not have a good lost and found tracking system. What makes it even more of a bummer is that we tip well and did so for the house keeping staff as we always do. This is totally our fault for leaving the chargers in the room, but I was hopeful based off our great experience during our stay that they would be located. Don't let this sour your thoughts of staying here, as we will certainly consider coming back to this property.

Hyatt calls this a luxury hotel and I agree. The hotel has a huge beautiful lobby that sets the tone of the place. I paid a little extra for a view room and Grand Club Lounge access and boy was it worth it. My room was very nice with a beautiful view of downtown, Pine Street and the water. I loved watching the ferries come and go. The Grand Club Lounge is easily one of the best I have ever seen. Very high end spread in the morning and evening with coffee, sodas and water all day long. The Hotel is right next to the convention center and short walking distance to tons of shopping, restaurants and the Pike Place Market. Everything in downtown is close and easy to get to. If you are going to stay in downtown don\u2019t bother to rent a car. Just get a taxi to and from the airport and save the hassle and cost of parking. Restaurant service is from the attached Ruth Chris. Good food but not cheap. There are tons of restaurants in every price range close by and all over downtown if you don\u2019t want to eat there. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was modern and immaculate with a huge bathroom. My only small gripe is the single power outlet at the desk. In order to plug my laptop and phone charger in I had to unplug the desk lamp. You pay a little more for this place but I feel you get what you paid for. I will definitely come back to this hotel. Tips: Ask for a high floor with a view. The Roosevelt hotel is right next to the Hyatt and could block a water view if you are on a lower floor. Make sure you are above it. The Grand Club Lounge is well worth the extra money. Terrific high end spread in the morning and evening with very reasonably priced wine & liquor during happy hour. It has great views and is a very comfortable place to hang out. I have seen many lounges and this was easily one of the best. Bring a power strip if you plan to work at the desk.

The club lounge is small and offers pretty basic stuff. A simple continental breakfast in the morning and canapes/snacks in the evening (incidentally..Pepsi?? Come on..please switch to Coca Cola). The room is a good size and the bathroom was satisfactory. It is a 10 minute walk to the market and 5 minutes to the subway/rail station. To be honest, between this and the Hyatt Olive 8 which is a couple hundred feet away, I would stay at the cheaper of the two at any given time. They are pretty similar. If you get breakfast included as a Diamond member, Olive 8 offers a better breakfast in the restaurant, as they do not have a lounge. O8 does not have a lounge though.

It started off well enough. The check-in process was easy enough and our room was very nicely appointed. As others have noted, the parking charges are pretty outrageous (though standard for a downtown location), as are the various charges for \"extras\" such as wi-fi. The first night we had dinner nearby (tons of options within walking distance) and came back to settle in for the evening. At about 10 p.m., we noticed quite a bit of noise in the adjacent room. It sounded like a group of young women. But the noise diminished by 10:30, so we figured they had gone to bed. Wishful thinking. At 1:30 a.m., we were awoken by the sound of several men and women in the adjacent room. Turns out the women hadn't gone to bed, but had gone out to find some friends. Not only was the now larger group very loud, but their room's smoke detector was beeping intermittently. We called the front desk and reached a clerk who sounded like he was expecting the call. He sent security up, who warned the group to quiet down. About 20 minutes later, we heard slamming doors, a barrage of profanity (many f-bombs) and realized security was back to escort the men from the room. Unfortunately, the ladies continued talking and laughing till 4 a.m. (My wife had managed to fall asleep, and I didn't want to get back on the phone and wake her up. So I just hoped the women would eventually fall asleep.) First thing in the morning, my wife visited the front desk to ask if the party group would be staying another night. The clerk said yes and that the partiers were hotel employees! To her credit, the clerk appeared very embarrassed by what she'd heard and promised to contact security to get the whole story. So they eventually moved us to a new room far away from the partying employees. And we enjoyed two restful nights after that.

Excellent and very modern property. 2118 is a King located on the 21st floor with a water view and direct view over the Roosevelt Hotel Sign across the street. This room is very spacious and comfortable. Ice however is not located on this floor. The bathroom is extremely large with a separate marble shower and large soaking tub. Includes all needed toiletries including toothpaste. A concern though was the lack of adequate lighting for applying makeup and the make up mirror with only a very small percentage of zoom. Internet and bottled water are available for an additional charge. Electronic minibar, Robe, large closet, iron, iron board, safe, large flat screen, radio with iPod player, electronic curtains with remote near bed. Concierge extremely helpful. This particular Hyatt did disappoint us with their lower end bedding. The mattress was creaky and very very uncomfortable. We asked members of our traveling party about their opinion on the mattreses, and they also felt the same way. Strange as other Hyatts we have frequented have never had this problem. Our 2nd room 1624 is a corner unit with a separate area for the living room and bedroom. The view was very nice as the bedroom has a corner window. This bathroom is smaller but gorgeous as well. Noticed some \"stains\" on the bedroom wall above the bed that should have been easily noticed by housekeeping. This room has two flatscreens and can be a used as a connecting room with an adjacent one. Bed was a little better but the same quality. This property is located in a very good location which allows easy access to all downtown areas including the monorail to the Space Needle. Taxis around the downtown/pier area run from $4 to $8. Very inexpensive. There is a Bus that runs near all the attractions that is free (Orange Line on your maps). Regency Club sort of surprised as we were charged $5 for drinks $4 for beer during their cocktail hours. I don't know if this is a new policy, but never had we paid for drinks before at any other Regency Club. Room is quite small. Breakfast was ok, typical continental, bagel, toast, lox, cereal, oatmeal, coffees, juice and a small selection of fruits. Staff was extremely friendly!

I loved being able to open the little window and get some fresh air into the room. The room was large, had a chair and ottoman as well as desk and chair and the large bathroom was spectacular! Loved the bath and giant glass shower (no clingly wet shower curtain here!). Water pressure in the shower was great, the bath was relaxing and a decent size. I did find that the tv while a newer flatscreen, for some reason some of the channels were very poor quality in terms of pixilating and being fuzzy (CW and the channels below), while others were in HD, and I found the number of channels very limited, considering the wide vairety offered at other hotels. Also having to pay the $9.95 daily internet fee (14.95 for faster internet, but to be honest I didn't notice a difference surfing the internet/uploading photos etc) was per device which was frustrating! Other hotels charge per room, not per device. Its annoying having to pay for internet in this day and age, especially such an amount per day, but the per device is just over the top.

You can take the light rail from SeaTac to the Westlake Station and then walk for only about three blocks to get to the hotel. The Westlake Station is also where you can catch the monorail to the Seattle Center where the Space Needle is located along with several other interesting sites. You are about seven blocks from the Pike Place Market also and from there easy access to the waterfront. If you want to visit the Pioneer Square area, you can hop on the light rail and be there in minutes. In a three block radius you can find two shopping centers, the bookstores Borders and Barnes and Noble, and, of course, a Starbuck's on about every corner. There's a lot to see and do in Seattle. We had a CityPass (online) that made it easier to have tickets for several places. We would definitely suggest you do the Underground tour in Pioneer Square. We walked to most of the places.

If you walk down Pine street you pass the retail stores, the monorail - which takes you to the Space Needle and Science Center, restaurants, pubs and lots of people watching. Everything felt easy and smooth, allowing us to experience the city the way we like - at our own pace. The valet car service was pricey at $34 a day. You had unlimited in/out access and we needed a car to visit friends in another part of the city. There is a sushi restaurant, a Ruth Chris Steak house and a Starbucks on the lobby floor...which was perfect to grab a quick latte before heading out in the morning. Check out was smooth, the front desk and staff always greeted you professionally and always available for questions. We would stay here again and I highly recommend the hotel for those who like high end hotel experience and quality sleep on the pillow top beds.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Little Rock, AR", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel of our Trip!\u201d", "Author": "TravelingRN1117", "ReviewID": "UR114681845", "Content": "Stayed three nights in an Executive Suite with my husband and 21 month old son.

I thought the rate was reasonable for the size and quality of the room. I heard no noise from the hall or from adjacent rooms. Things less than perfect included the lighting which was relatively dim. There was no good reading lamp by a chair or sofa. The HVAC was drafty and cool. I finally got it to an acceptable warmth by setting the two thermostats to 75 degrees. Wi-Fi internet access cost $10 per night. It should have been free. The hotel is two blocks from the Westlake station on the light rail line. I was able to use light rail to get to the airport at a cost of $2.50. Trains run at least every 15 minutes and the travel time from Westlake to SeaTac was 38 minutes. The Westlake station is part of the bus tunnel system and I used buses to get around downtown for free. The hotel has three eating options: 1) Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, 2) Starbucks and 3) a so-called deli with an assortment of cafeteria-style foods. I found the deli unappealing. I had a decent sandwich at Starbucks. I had two excellent and reasonably price breakfasts at Ruth's plus a light early dinner there. I was pleased with Ruth's on all counts. Downtown Seattle has a lot of interesting things to see and do, including an abundance of restaurants. I visited the impressive Central Library and the Art Museum.

It was a choice between the Grand Hyatt and the Hyatt Olive 8 across the street.

Check in went smoothly and we were pleased with our room overlooking Pine Street. Our double bed room was comfortable and clean, I still get a kick out of the movable window shades there. The bath was large and roomy with a tub and separate shower stall. Overall we received very efficient service from the staff there. My interactions with the front desk, concierge and bellman were professional and courteous. The only glitch was with housekeeping. Usually Grand Hyatt service is extremely prompt, but this time there were a couple of minor issues that really surprised us on this visit. Upon arrival in the late afternoon we noticed only two sets of towels for our family. We called down and requested extra towels and drinking glasses. After a couple of hours we called again, but never received them that evening so had to share towels and glasses. The next morning we asked the cleaning staff to put them out for us which they did. The other issue was our ice bucket was not emptied and our used drinking glasses were still there on the desk after our room was serviced. Nothing to ruin our stay, but very noticeable and hopefully not something that happens regularly. This is a great property in a very convenient location which is the reason we stayed here. Pike Place Market is an easy walk and there are many stores, several malls and lots of restaurants in the immediate area.

Upon arrival i found quite bunch of hair in the bathtube. They send someone to cleen that up but would never apolgize. The other day they missed to clean the toillet and once they didn`t change the linen even tough they had some nasty stains. -To get the complymentary turndown service (wich is quite good, the put even choclates on the pillow) you have to call every single night the front desk -Deskchair is uncofortable (design vs. comfort) -Nobody asks you I you`d like to get the complimentary newspaper. I assume this is systematic. -Booking a city or water view room dosen`t garantee you a good view. It`s possible to get a view of the giant exhaust duct of the kitchen. -Room service (food) About the food: there was absoluty nothing special about it exept for the price. I had a sheperd`s pie (24$) with lamb as tough as leather and a clam chowder (9$) wich was absoluty uneatable. It was more like the sewage of a clam chowder. To this already high prices the add a tray charge of 3$, well, tax AND a 20% service charge wich includes the tip but they only give 16% to the employees and keep 4% --- They even have to earn on the freakin` tip. Unbelevable. -Internet: Should be free these days especially in such an expensive Hotel. It costs 9.95 for 24 hours. They give you also the option to choose between 3 or 5 day passes witch wil save you 0 cents. Thank you, Hyatt!

The bellman knew that the resteraunt had a car service for free and went out of his way to call them so we can go in style. That to me is above and beyond. He could have just whistled for a cab, but no, he went and called the restaurant for us and got us a limo. Fantastic.

The switch was behind the lamp on the bedside table with the radio.........after leaving my bags I walked downstairs to find something to eat.

It was very good but I do not recall name--il Fornio? The room was clean, nice TV, free internet to Passport members, nice amenities in the bathroom with deep soaking tub and separate shower, No complaints. There were magazines in the room to read which I appreciated. Breakfast in the Club Lounge the next morning was disappointing. I had eaten breakfast in Marriott concierge lounges most every morning the week before and had been pleased. Breakfast here was very skimpy--three or four choices of cold cereal, some pastries, smoked salmon, cheese and capers. Nothing hot except coffee. There were two choices of Greek yogurt--honey or pomegranate. Check-out was easy. I used award points for the stay so can't say much about value.

Room was pretty nice but not that much better than rooms at say the Novotel or Courtyard Marriot in Toronto. King sized bed was nice but I found the sheets kind of annoying, as they came loose very easily during the night. The bathroom was probably the highlight - it was huge. Shower probably had room for 3-4 people, separate tub. Very nice. Powered black out shades were neat, and the comfy chair with foot stool was appreciated. Hot tub was a welcome relaxation at the end of our week. Fitness room seemed very nice. Cons - We kind of felt like the Clampett's arriving in Beverly Hills a few times walking around in our grubby jeans etc. (More with some of the the main desk staff and a general impression. ) Perhaps that was just me being self conscious, I don't know. Concierge was super knowledgeable and gave us great info when asked specific questions, but did not really volunteer enough info when asked a broader question. Biggest con for me was the lack of free wireless. Seriously? The Starbucks downstairs, Barnes and Noble, and the mall across the street can all give it away for free but apparently not the Hyatt. Welcome to the 2000s... This seems to be the case at many upper range hotels, along with things like $1 local phone calls (which we wouldn't have had to make if we'd had wi-fi...), over the top ppv movie charges, and offering to rent you a fridge since the paid mini bar can't be emptied. The business center computer required a credit card to activate it. One of these things would be fine, but the combination of all of them just feels... Miserly. I loved the hotel and the high end touches, but these little things make me inclined to forfeit the luxury in favour of of usefulness at a cheaper hotel.

It has everything that you could want in a hotel. We stayed last year for our anniversary and the staff was amazing and we had more than a wonderful stay. This year though...darn it...we traveled with our small children and I was stressed the entire time. Ugh! We arrived around 3:00 pm and got to our room quickly. Perfect. Next, we put our little ones down for a nap. Here's the problem. If you are a parent with small children and you value nap time, this hotel is not the place. You could hear so much noise outside our doors. The banging of doors, the people walking by, and housekeeping. We struggled to get them to go down because each time they would almost get there, there would be a big bang or the person doing the housekeeping would make some noises in the hall. I was sitting in the bathroom reading my book (where else could I go while they were napping? LOL) and I could seriously hear the person next door going to the restroom. Yikes! Because I could hear all these noises, I knew that our neighbors would be able to hear our kids...that's the part that stressed me out the most...trying to keep them quiet so they didn't bother anyone else. We stuffed some towels in the crack under the door to keep some of the noise out, but it didn't work too well. We thought ahead to bring our own fan for some white noise, but even this didn't help much. I guess another issue would be that we didn't have a fridge or a microwave that we could use for our little guy's milk. I had to go down to Starbucks each time and buy some heated milk. $2 each time. Spendy! If you aren't traveling with small kids, these issues will mean nothing to you because most adults don't need naps at 3 pm nor have to worry about keeping beverages warm or cold. Would we stay there again.? If it's just hubby and I...in a heart beat. If we need a place to stay when we are traveling with our kids....ohhhhh....I don't know.

I know I can phone and get my questions answered, but I prefer e-mail/Facebook/Twitter for things that aren't of great urgency. Very easy to get to from the freeway, and the valet was very prompt and helpful. Parking was a little pricey ($33) but that seems to be the norm for that area. Had a wonderful lady (Jocelyn) help us get checked in and set up with a late checkout for the next day. One of the reasons I love Hyatt hotels is the amazing job they do training their staff. This was no exception. Stayed in a club room on the 26th floor with a great view down Pine St. to the water and of the Space Needle off to the right. Room was very clean and the furnishings seemed to be in reasonable shape. Bathroom was a very good size with both a stand-alone shower and a spacious tub. We found the bed comfy, but to be honest we were so tired by the end of the night that the floor would have sufficed just fine. Most importantly, thank you for having the NFL network available in the room. As it was NFL draft weekend, this was of vital importance to me (My wife...not so much.) Ate dinner and breakfast in the Regency Club. Dinner was do-it-yourself BLT sandwiches (which were fabulous) and breakfast was your standard continental fare although there was some very good smoked salmon available. Staff in the club were very helpful. I asked for directions to the Moore theater, and while giving me the directions the girl made sure to warn me of an area that I would be headed through that was less than desirable late at night. It wasn't a particular concern of mine, but it was nice to have the warning. Hotel was nicely located to spend the morning at Pike Place market...maybe a 5 minute walk.

First, it must be attached to the convention center somehow because the signage and entrance in relation to an overpass/overhead parking structure made the hotel difficult to find. We had to drive around the block a few times and call the front desk to find the unobtrusive check-in location. Lobby is large and expansive.....and in our case, empty and cold.

Front desk staff was robotic. The bathroom was huge and clean but the room was very cramped. Bedding and upholstery were warn and in need of updating.

Nice location, usually excellent service, and very clean. We recommend it to everyone, but this time we were highly disappointed and are considering staying somewhere else for next time.

The couch had crusty food on the arm that was very obvious and needed to be steam cleaned (gross), the couches also are getting to the point where I think it's time to replace them. Also, there were some stains on the carpet and a splatter on the wall where someone spilled some type of drink.

The reason I'm taking the time to write this review is that for $250 a night, this shouldn't happen. Also, whenever we've had a problem at the Hyatt their customer service is top-notch, but no so this time. Unfortunately I didn't mention any of this until check-out (we were busy!) and the response I received was lackluster at best. The person at the front desk scribbled one of the things I told her on a note pad and looked at me like I was crazy. Maybe she thought I was telling her that I had done these things? I'm not sure. But she said she would pass it on to the housekeeping staff and that was it. No apology or acting like it was a problem. Maybe a meal coupon or something for next time to make up for it? But nothing.

The desk clerk, a beautiful Scandanavian woman named Hana, greeted me with a warm smile, explained some of the features of the hotel--including two or three restaurants just steps away, and a 24-hour gym that I was too busy to use--and she told me to call her if I needed anything at all. At breakfast, Maheer, the waiter, recommended a half stack of blueberry \"flapjacks\" along with eggs--and they were probably the most delicious pancakes I have eaten in my life. The hotel's location cannot be beat--a short walk from Pike Market, right next door to a couple movie theatres and a book store. The room itself was perfectly quiet up on the 10th floor, with a cozy King bed and a luxurious bathroom. The only downside has nothing to do with the hotel at all but everything to do with the current economy in recession-struck Seattle. Just one block away and continuing at all hours throughout downtown, you will encounter literally hundreds of homeless as well as dozens of aggressive and verbally abusive panhandlers.

A spacious livingroom that has a flat screen TV and bar refrig. If you want to store cool items, you can rent an extra one for $5/day. The bathroom is perfect that sits between both rooms along the hallway. We had problems with the young adult-teens next door and asked for hotel security to quiet them down at 2:30 in the morning. Next morning, we asked to be moved and the hotel manager gave us a beautiful suite, twice the size. It definitely made our vacation worthwhile. We also had access to the Club which is where we got our fresh grind coffee from 6am-9pm daily. The one cup coffee maker is not the real deal when it comes to drinking coffee. Otherwise, you can go down to the lobby and have Starbucks. When you check-in as a AAA member, make sure you tell them you want the breakfast coupons for Ruth Chris. They are worth up to $25 each so you can get up to a $50 breakfast for two. It's worth every penny. We tried to make reservations for dinner there but couldn't get in early before 8 pm because of the show \"Wicked\" booked that week. So we got a sit in the bar area during happy hour from 4-6pm and decided to have appetizers for $5 each along with our delicous red Cab wine called 14 Hands. OMG ! We ordered all five appetizers on the menu and doubled on the prime rib sliders. We ended up finding a wine store in town and bought six bottles of the 14 Hands wine @ $12 and packed it in our suitcases for our plane ride back. As for outside the hotel, be aware of your surroundings when you walk downtown. There are a lot of bums and peddlers everywhere. If you walk down to Pikes Place Market, stay on Pine street. On the backside of the hotel is Pikes street which has the convention center behind there. I wouldn't recommend going down that street to the Market because there seems to be more bums out there and don;t eat at Fox's on Pike street. Horrible food! Caddy corner to the hotel is a mall called Pacific Place where there is a movie on the top floor along with many restaurants. We recommend the Mexican restaurant. We didn't rent a car this time because our friend chauffeured us around, but if you eat at Ruth Chris, you can park there for six hours with validation but still have to pay $8.

Upon arrival, we were met immediately by a bell captain and valet for parking. There didn't appear to be better choices for parking in the immediate vicinity, so we had to pay the parking fees. We arrived at check-in time so there was no problem getting our room right away. We were on the 24th floor with a beautiful view of the city down to the sound. The room was good size with a king bed, flat screen TV, desk, chair and ottoman. Floor to ceiling windows made the room seem larger. They had automatic window treatments for either letting in or blocking out light as needed. To me what really made the room was the enormous bathroom with separate soaking tub and shower plus a large vanity for putting out our belongings. They also provided robes and nice toiletries (including toothpaste which was a nice touch). There is a mini-fridge, but it's filled with items for purchase, so it's hard to use. They offer to bring up a small refrigerator for a $5 fee. I don't know where we would have put it. It would've been nice to have another chair in the room for lounging and reading. Otheriwse, one of us was always relegated to the bed for reading, which I found uncomfortable after awhile. We used the concierge and found his information to be a bit wanting. He directed us to a local laundry, which proved to be a long walk for nothing. We used the map they gave us after that to find out where things were, as well as the Internet. I did get free Internet as I'm a Platinum member, but I agree with others that it should probably be provided given the cost of the rooms. On a bit of a sour note, we were held up for quite some time when we went to check out. We had prepaid for the room, but were charged again. It took them some time to figure out how to back the charges off our credit card. The Pike St Market is a must-see, but try to go during the week. The weekends are crazy with masses of people moving through the market. The Music museum and Musem of Flight were really worthwhile; I recommend both.

The staff tried to find another corner that would accomodate us but they were all taken (but the staff went out of their way to try to find a way to get a corner for us). They found a regular king room on the 22nd floor that faced the Bay and asked us if we wanted to look at first. They took us to see it (room 2217) and it was great! We even liked the room and bathroom layout better (since we didn't have our kids with us, we didn't really need the suite). The view was spetacular! You could even see the Needle (off to the right by leaning close to the glass). For your information, the bay side rooms are rooms 2215-2222 or 2224. I don't think you can see the bay on floors less than about 20 due to the \"Roosevelt\" hotel blocking the view. The room is spacious for two with a great king bed, desk, armoire, ~32\" LCD TV, iPod docking station, and a chair/ottoman. The bathroom is great with marble and glass. We also got the \"business\" plan with our room since it was comparable to the corner suite price. It is about $30 more per day but you more than make up for it with: breakfast at Ruth's Chris in the hotel ($25 voucher), free internet ($10 value), free shirt/pant press each day (?$), free bottle of water each day. They gave us two breakfast voucher's for each day for four days and even allowed us to use them at lunch for the cash equivalent (another sign of their excellent service).

Since it was \u201chighly\u201d rated by TripAdvisor Contributors I decided to give it a go. I have to say I was a \u201clittle disappointed\u201d from what I was expecting for a Grand Hyatt (their flagship property). By no means is this a \u201cbad choice\u201d so don\u2019t get me wrong, it really just depends on your likes and dislikes. Here is a summary of my experience and my opinion on this property: Location \u2013 I give it a 50/50. Yes, you are semi-in the heart of downtown Seattle (but on the edge, close to the freeway). You are near shopping, businesses and the convention center BUT you are also close to the freeway so many of the rooms have \u201cfreeway view\u201d. My room/suite actually had a combo-freeway/water view (peek-a-boo on the water side)\u2026I honestly expected more water and less freeway for what I was paying. Now, you don\u2019t really hear the freeway too much but you do get to look at it depending on where your room is. For a comparable price, there are several hotels in the area with much better views that are much closer to the water and sites. Charm \u2013 There is not much \u201ccharm\u201d to this hotel but I don\u2019t know that is the objective either. It\u2019s fairly corporate with clean lines but so many properties in downtown Seattle have special touches like wine tasting in the lobby, fireplaces in room, etc. where they really make it feel special (think the Monaco, or Mayflower or Vintage Park, etc.). Food - Well yes there is a Ruth Chris on property but while that is a nice high end place, it\u2019s a chain. Give me something with true \u201cSeattle\u201d personality. Seattle is such a \u201cfoodie\u201d town, I can go to Ruth Chris in any major city in the U.S. Rooms \u2013 The best part is the bathroom in my opinion hand\u2019s down. Spacious, modern, clean, etc. Sure that\u2019s great, but how much are you really in there? The bedrooms while fairly standard for Hyatt and most the chains these days (comfortable beds, flatscreens, etc.) the furniture was a little worn. Some of my furniture had lots of nicks and scrapes. Additionally the \"attractive leather\" chair at the desk was not adjustable nor that comfortbale so I could not really utilize the desk in comfort as I could with an ergonomic chair many hotels provide these days. The bedroom portion of the room itself reminded me a bit of the size you find in NYC at a \u201cW\u201d or something similar. There is not much area between the bed and wall/dressers so if two of you are trying to pass to get to the door or bath at the same time, it will be tight. Realistically that is not untypical for an urban hotel but in many of the Seattle downtown properties, they appear to be a bit more generous in the size of the bedroom itself (in this case, a decent amount of square footage goes to the bathroom). Perhaps it was just the layout or usage of the square footage but I was not that excited about it. Gym \u2013 Well I am always fairly happy with the Hyatt facilities for their gym and one of the reasons I come back. Maintaining a workout on the road is important to me and they are always well equipped, clean and spacious and are more like a real \u201cgym\u201d than just a small \u201cfitness room\u201d that many properties offer. All that being said, I probably won\u2019t come back to this particular Hyatt. I think Seattle has a lot more \u201cinteresting\u201d properties in this price range and location with special touches you just don\u2019t get at the larger corporate chains.

However we experienced a number of problems this time which detracted from their previous service. We made a booking for a room with 2 beds, one for us and one for our teenager. They turned out to be very small double beds, (almost incapable of holding two grown adults), not queens which are the usual size in most upscale hotels of this category. Unfortunately they were also very uncomfortable which is strange as we have found Hyatt beds so comfortable previously we even considered buying one! Secondly our room had a connecting door to the next room. There was a lock for safety, unfortunately it didn't stop any noise which meant that we could hear every conversation, cough and pin drop next door. Thirdly when we tried to fill the bath the plug would not work and the bath drained quicker than it was filling. Unfortunately we only found this out at 11pm on our first night. After reporting it next morning it was mended before 6pm. It meant that we only had a chance to use the bath on one of our two nights stay, which was a bit of a let down. Fourthly, when we tried to arrange a later checkout they could not accommodate us. Odd as we didn't have a problem the previous time we stayed, even though we booked the room on points on both occasions. Lastly, when we went down to catch a taxi to the airport there was no porter to be seen anywhere. We were jumped on by two taxi drivers parked in the loop who ended up heatedly arguing over us in the middle of the Grand Hyatt driveway/lobby door area. Not exactly the behavior expected in a hotel of this class. A porter should be there at all times to organise transport, baggage, etc and to assist guests of the hotel We ended up walking onto the street to hail another taxi to avoid the argument.

You catch the downtown bus at door 00. The large bus drops you right off in front of the Grand Hyatt on 7th and picks you up there as well. Since my business was near downtown, I did not need a auto rental. My check in was warm and welcoming by one of the most cheerful Hyatt folks in a long time - Jen. More properties need employees such as Jen. My room was not available so I dropped off my luggage and walked over to the Westlake Center and took the Monorail to the Seattle Center. Purchased some souvenirs at the Space Needle. Returned to the Westlake Center and ate lunch at their food court which was not bad (Thai food vendor). My room was a corner room and I had a special group rate, that was better than the Renaissance and the rates at the Marriott Waterfront properties. The corner room has plenty of natural light via the floor to ceiling windows. The T.V. room offers a desk, minibar, T.V., loveseat and chair. I have to admit as some previous reviewers stated, these chairs are uncomfortable. Strictly for the look. Whoever purchased they chairs were not thinking of their guests comfortability. Amazing, a hospitality business and they do not test out the chairs but probably went for price. Thankfully that was only bad thing about the room and my stay at this property. As mentioned in other reviews there a very nice marble bathroom with both shower and tub. Plenty of closet space in the hall seperating the front room from the bedroom. A lucky bamboo in the front foyer is a nice touch! The water temperature and pressure were fine. The cleaning was excellent each day I was there. The bed was comfortable and room was quiet from outside street noise and across the way construction. Could not hear other room noise as well. I used the well equipped gym which was busy most mornings and including some rude guests as well, ready to jump on your exercise machine when you're getting some water. I ate several breakfasts at the Ruth Chris Steakhouse, attached to this property. Service was always excellent! One breakfast was excellent and the other good. I also ate one dinner there and the steak was excellent and side dishes tasty and service excellent. Expensive though. There are no cheap diners nearby...but there is Cheese Cake Factory; Daily Grille and Starbucks within a block of the property. This property is easy walk to Westlake Mall and Center. And is not too far and walkable to the Pike Place Marketplace. This being August, the weather was a bit warm and sunny. I took two tours during my time in Seattle. The Seattle Mini Bus tour with a every a good looks and stops around the city and it's districts. The driver tour guide was highly knowledgble and warm. Most folks on the tour were returning from Alaska cruise ship tours which is Big business in Seattle now since 9/11 and less business in Vancouver, Canada. I highly recommend the Pike Public Market food tour. Excellent and attentive guide. With some much insight and context, it makes your walking around the interesting Pike Market much more enjoyable. You wear ear sets & and receivers so you can hear the guide. Plus the food samples were very good! I highly recommend the Pike vendors: MarketSpice; Pike Place Fish (yummy salmon); Frank's Quality Produce; Pike Place \"New England\" Chowder; Chukar Cherries (tasty); Beecher'shandmade Cheese; Piroshky Piroshky; and Etta's Seafood. Right before my Pike Market food tour. I checked the local weather forecast on t.v. The news person said expect more than you typical Seattle summer rain and bring an umbrella if you're going to be out and about in the afternoon. I was only one of a few that morning walking around the market with a umbrella but by the afternoon. It began raining hard and many were caught unguarded and very wet! I also recommend Ivar's Seafood along the waterfront. Seattle also offers free public transportation, and i took the bus to and from the International District and visited a well stocked Asian market called Uwajimaya.

You could do the valet parking for a few dollars more than what it would cost to park your car in the parkade. I should have done this because you get in and out as many times as you want, whereas the other option is to pay each time you leave the parkade.... by the end of the weekend, that ended up costing me more.

We pre-paid for the hotel before we left, so we weren't expecting much of a bill.

The corner suite has a work area, a long hallway, then a bedroom with wall to floor windows on 2 walls. Bathrooms have great soaking tubs with waterfall faucets, separate dressing areas, and aveda amenities. We were on the concierge floor, with access to a lounge with concierge (very nice and helpful lady), internet service, good breakfast, sodas, fruit, water, and hot snacks, a good cheese selection and drinks at night. There's always espresso, coffee and mochas available as well, which is a favorite in our family. Room service is quick and efficient. The location, again, is good for the convention center or shopping. There are many good restaurants within walking distance, and if you don't want to eat breakfast in the concierge lounge try to get the b and b package; it includes a hearty breakfast in the adjacent Ruth's Chris steakhouse. Parking is expensive, valet or self, but that's unfortunately par for Seattle. The furniture is a bit worn, with the occasional stained pillow or scraped desk. The bed was very bad, the worst I've slept on in a long time - had we been there longer I would have requested some kind of stabilizing board under the mattress.", "Date": "November 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel in Seattle\u201d", "Author": "kpieper876", "ReviewID": "UR10591559", "Content": "I stay in Seattle a few times every month.

Just to let you know, we had a choice this year for vacation spots between Chicago and Seattle. This year we chose Chicago since we were coming here for the wedding. While Chicago was fun, our stay at the Grand Hyatt in Seattle made Seattle a much more pleasant stay and us envying that we didn't vacation here. Getting to the Hyatt is easy, just by a ticket on the Grey line bus. Bus ticket and terminal is at the end of the airport dear door 00. It was a long walk for use but the trip bus ride was easy and convienent. The Grand Hyatt's location is great. Its 4-5 blocks to Pike's Market, 3 blocks to the Monorail. Our room did not have a direct view of the water but you could still see the water if you looked out the window and to the left a bit. We were only there for a couple of nights, but shopping was close at hand and the SciFi museum was fun. The Experience Music Project was a bit of a let down but came free with the SciFi museum ticket. We didn't go in the space needle. $16 per person to ride an elevator? No thanks. The monorail was cheap at $2 each way ($4 round trip). Pike's market was lively and colorful with the food and flower venders. Wished we stayed another night or two to visit Pioneer square and some other attractions. If you forget anything, the hotel's lobby store is well equiped but then again great shopping venues are only a block or two away. For food, I'd suggest going to Ruth's for breakfast. It was fairly hearty and tasted good. You should also try Cafe Campagne down the road near Pike's market. the food is country french and excellent. The road is also good for picture taking (big public market sign easily viewable) and is a straight shot from the hotel (exit left from the hotel's main entrance). The rooms were fairly spacious. My only sore point is the drawer space for clothes. There were four small drawers available. While usable they were still a bit small. This however was not as bad a situation as could be given that the closet was fairly large with plenty of hangers and a cubical style shelf for storing clothing. Basically, you have enough space for two people to store clothing for about a week. The bathroom was large and well accomodated. Marble flooring and nice counter top space allowed for me and my fiance to spread our toilettries out. The room came with both shower and bath and the bath filled quickly and easily. A standard coffee maker was avaiable but why would anyone bother with hotel in room coffee is beside me since Starbucks is downstairs and thier restaurant is fairly upscale. The television is a stand 29\" and kind of low end for a hotel but then again, no one really comes to a hotel just to watch TV. Standard minifridge and bar avaiable but not used. I kind of wonder why hotels keep providing these things since I haven't known anyone who would use them. Net connection runs from $7-$10 a day depending on connectivity and options. Wireless is through T-Mobile but they do have wired connections. Decor was kind of Modern Italian and the picts of the room should give you a good idea.

Should have kept my reservations at the Westin or probably should have booked at the Marriott. We took the shuttle which we learned about via of the Hyatt website. We were put out at the 6th Street entrance. There was no one there at that entrance to help with baggage. We had 4 suitcases & first had to lug up stairs to the lobby. Once in the lobby, which was not impressive, we were not greeted by anyone. We lugged our bags to a cart that was at the check in deck. No problem with the check in. When the lady asked if we needed help with our luggage, we said that we had lugged it this far & had put it on the cart & thus we could get it to the room. She replied by saying that we could not use the cart & that the bell boy would have to push it. We were up high & had a good view of the Sound & the Lake but the AT&T building was in the way. When I looked in our bathroom, I noticed that it did not have a separte shower. I called the front desk to ask what happened. I told her that my main reason for changing was due to the bath area reviews. At first she did not know what I was talking about & then she said that they did have a couple of rooms that did not have a separate shower. I asked for another room & she said that they were booked up unless I wanted to upgrade. I told her no & that we would just keep the room. We proceeded to unpack. Shortly later, some lady knocked at the door & inquired as to our check in. I told her what had happened & she said that she would see what she could do. Just before we left our room, she called back to see if we wanted to move & we said no because we had already unpacked. Probably should have based on future problems. Went downstairs to the concierge, Eric. He was on the phone, not business purpose. He apparently did not appreciate us bothering him & thus he was very short with us & was no help. In fact, one of the waiters in the bar was more helpful. The bath area was very, very disappointing. The first night, we could not get but luke warm water. Only one time during our stay, did we even have to turn the cold water on. The tub was nice & big but it had some space at the back & front. This was a problem for the shower. The shower curtain did not cover the whole tub & thus water would run out on the floor. The only way for the shower not to make a mess was to take it off the holder & hold it close to the tub. Have you ever had to take a shower that the water went from would go back & forth from kind of hot to luke warm & the pressure would go back & forth? If not, stay at the Hyatt. If this is the #1 rated hotel in Seattle, then I hate to see the others. Maybe, trip advisor needs to revisit as to how they rate the hotels. We left Seattle & went to Vancouver for a couple of nights & then drove back to Seattle to fly back home. The night before we left, we stayed at the Marriotti at the airport & it was great.

For a good happy hour (even on weekends) go to the Dragonfish restaurant across the street at the Paramount Hotel (good Asian food & drink specials).

Great views and polite service. Slightly worn around the edges and in need of a few upgrades (flat screen TVs in room). Amazing work out facilities. The place to go on business but too big for special occasions requiring a \"personal touch.\" Just spent my 30th birthday in my hometown, Seattle, but decided to make it special with a stay in the Grand Hyatt. I checked in around 4 pm and was immediately greeted by a bellhop asking if he could check my bag. Not sure why he was asking the question, I replied, \"no thanks, I'm checking in.\" Not a good start. After checking in, I went up to my room. We had booked an Emerald Suite (832 square feet, floors 26 - 30) and requested a quiet suite on a high floor and on a corner. I walked into the room on the 28th floor, closed the door and was about to settle into a chair and enjoy the views when I heard the thud of an ice maker, foot traffic, and a lot of thoat clearing. Stepping outside I found the ice machine across from the room and a \"hospitality suite\" hosting a Veterans Association. I went downstairs and Lara was able to move me up a floor...wonderfully quiet! The room itself (2922) is on a corner and offers spectacular views of Seattle: Queen Anne, EMP, Space Needle, core downtown, Pike Place, and the water! The furnishing were tasteful and the bed fairly comfortable (not as nice as a Westin \"Heavenly Bed\" but still wonderful). The bathroom was spectacular with a soaking tub, \"waterfall\" faucet, and seperate shower. The only distraction to the room was the visible wear and tear such as the dinged up and scratched furniture and the scuffs and dents in the walls. Additionally, the small old fashioned TVs seemed out of place though I have heard they will soon upgrade to flatscreens.

Plenty of great restaurants (try ICONS - outstanding comfort food). - Excellent view (NW corner of the hotel) - directly down Pike Street past the shopping district to the Public Market, and Elliot Bay beyond. Also great view to the N. of the Space Needle. - Large room - size was perfect and comfortable. - Blackout shades - if you want to sleep in and not be awakened by the light, you'll have no problem here. - Helpful, courteous staff - we found everyone to be helpful and attentive, especially in the Regency Club. - Tastefully decorated - very warm, sumptuous appointments throughout. Great sheets and pillows. Great lighting. Great bathtub and shower. NW theme with understated asian influence. - Regency Club - tasty breakfast (if you enjoy granola and fresh fruit, and pastries), yummy snacks, plenty of papers and interesting books, great place to relax. There's complimentary internet access here also. Here's the \"could have been better\" (I'm reaching here, as we loved it and will definitely come back again!): - Hot water was lukewarm the first evening - no problem throughout the rest of our stay. - Drop off area is tight.

There are just little things - like the person you call to request your car be brought up - she was very gruff. But really, this is hardly that important. Also, there are no automatic doors - this is a pain for people with a stroller, but would also be a headache for people requiring wheeled assistance. Highly recommended.

Front desk pleasantly confirmed we had booked a king, non-smoking room and proceded to send us up to a smoking room on the 23rd floor. The odor was overwhelming. Return to the front desk revealed there were only 4 unoccupied rooms in the hotel (it was a Saturday night). They offered to put us in a non-smoking double room and change us Sunday morning.

First, the good: The hotel is in a great location, near all the shopping action of downtown and within walking distance of all major attractions. We stayed at the hotel a full week and never once needed or wished for a car. Most importantly, our room was spectacular. I can be a tough hotel critic but there's simply no way one could complain about this room: high-end finishes, a beautiful foyer area, large sitting area, two tvs, automatic shades, plush king bed, etc. etc. The views were glorious: We had a sweeping view of downtown and the bay to the south, and an unobstructed view of the Space Needle to the west. I should mention that we booked a so-called Emerald Suite and stayed on the 27th floor. For those who can splurge a little, I would highly recommend this; the room size and views on the higher floors are worth the price. We paid $470 a night, which is a lot, but I kept thinking a comparable room with comparable views in NYC would probably cost nearly a thousand. I suspect the lower floors don't have quite the views but enjoy the same impressive finishes, furnishings, and bedding. Now the bad: Our check-in process was so inefficient it was actually comical. We arrived after a cruise at 9:30am, which was understandably way too early. The desk staff said to come back for our room around noon, so we headed out , took our time to be respectful, and returned around 2:30pm. Still no room, but we were told the cleaning service was in the room and it would be ready shortly; the staff asked for our cell phone number and said they would call soon. We went out for lunch, and over an hour later still no room, and no phone call. We stopped back again, and were told \"ten more minutes\". So, we waited within view of the front desk, and 25 minutes later no one had approached us and the staff member who had been dealing with us was now gone. Anyway, in the grand scheme of things it was not the end of the world, and based on other postings on TripAdvisor this was clearly an abberation. So, we're staying with the \"Excellent\" rating, but will be curious to see if future reviewers have similar experiences.

They serve a nice continental breakfast complete with fresh fruit, juices and cereals. In the evening, there's always a cheese selection, veggies and a hot appetizer. For a small charge ($4 I think), you can enjoy good Washington state wines and beers. Plus, free Internet access. We saved so much money by paying a little extra per night. Holly, the Regency Club conceige, heard that we were celebrating our daughter's third birthday during our visit. Holly wrote a special Birthday note along with a special cookie with a candle and presents (rubber duck and a beach ball). It was a true act of kindness on her part. Everyone from the valets and the front desk folks to the Regency Club staff is very friendly and helpful. Housekeeping was top notch. Each day the room was spotless.

The rooms are fabulous. I want this bathroom in my house! The housekeeper was terrific and the beds are super comfy with down comforters. Also, the hotel is close to everything! We ran into a couple snags - otherwise I would have rated this hotel a 5. First, the concierge's at this hotel were not helpful at all. Maybe we would have been treated differently if we walked up to the desk in business suits. Scott, the night time concierge told us that all of their pamphlets were moved around but he would provide us with information on Victoria, we gave him our room number and nothing. Not even a telephone call. There was one woman that was helpful and we wish that she was there during the other times we needed help. We actually received better assistance at the Westin and we weren't even staying there! Second, upon leaving I tried to use the elevators only to find out that there was some kind of fire alarms going off. I thought this was odd since the fire alarm lights near the elevators were not flashing. I called down to the front desk and was told that the fire department needed to turn off the alarms and should take place by 6:00 a.m.. When I tried to go down again around 6:05, the elevators still would not work. I told her that I needed to leave in order to catch my flight and asked her to send up someone to bring down my luggage. She said OK but after 5 minutes, I had a strange feeling that I wasn't going to get any help. So, I lugged my suitcase down 10 flights. I guess I was kind of lucky, some guests had to come down as far as 26 flights of stairs. When I got to the last set of stairs, someone from Hyatt asked if I needed help. Yeah, OK. It's a little late for that! Later, I was told that the bellboys didn't even start their shift until 8:00 a.m.. I would have waited an aweful long time by the elevators if I hadn't decided to walk down the stairs! Bottom line.

They are both very comfortable and convenient. Our room at the Sheraton was big and bright but the bathroom was pretty small and a little dated. The Grand Hyatt room was much smaller and very dark but the bath was gorgeous. It was huge and new but the light was so dim it was really difficult to apply makeup. The amenities at the Sheraton are worthless - the Grand Hyatt was much better (but not as nice as Sofitel). Bed at the Sheraton was very comfortable but the Hyatt was incredible. Plus, they had a neat electronic room-darkening shade that really helped in the morning. They also had an electronic privacy button rather than the little tag you put outside the door. It was very quiet at both locations. They both charge $10 for in-room Internet, which I think is nickel & dime stuff considering the price of the room. The Hyatt (I think - and maybe the Sheraton, too) also tacks on a charge for the morning newspaper. You can choose not to get it, but you have to do so at registration, I believe. The only bar at the Hyatt is the Ruth Chris' bar - when we tried to take a glass of wine upstairs to our room, we were told that was not usually allowed, but if we were discreet, it was okay. We were successful, but I didn't appreciate feeling like a crook to take my drink upstairs! Did not attempt this at the Sheraton bar, so can't say about that.

Upon check-in our one night there, the front desk was so apologetic about the inconvenience that they gave us a corner suite. It was gorgeous. The hotel is contemporary, but has almost a mission-shaker influence to it (see pics). All the guest rooms had door bells and \"do not disturb\" buttons instead of door knob hangers. Our room also had electronic retractable drapery shades. Very cool! The hotel management left a letter of apology in our room, as well as a large bowl of fruit with a small bottle of wine.

I paid $300 for a Regency Club room, actually a Corner Suite. I'm not sure if all Regency Club guests get these rooms or what. The hotel is conveniently located, although all of downtown Seattle seems to be under construction, and the street in front of the hotel is totally dug up. This means noise. The interior of the hotel is teaky wood, modern and uncluttered. I found the staff to be young and a little inexperienced, but generally fine. There were two things I wish could be better about the property. First, my corner suite was cramped, dark and stuffy. There is only one little tiny window that opens, and with the construction noise, I didn't open it. There is a funky cooling system in place, such that you can only turn the temp down so far, then you can not set it to run and cool constantly. Often it was on auto and thus the stuffiness. The lighting in the room was poor, except for the bathroom, which had great lighting. The carpet was worn and stained in places. A couple of other points - you will pay for internet access; you will be charged if you move anything in the minibar (you can get a fridge for $5 a day), and you will be disappointed with the old fashioned TVs, if you like to watch the tube. On the plus side, the bed, the linens, and the bath with separate tub and shower were fantastic. The other issue I had was with dining options - or the lack thereof. There is a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse in the hotel, but their menu is pretty limited (especially for breakfast) and very pricey. I wish they had a restaurant that was less clubby with more choices. if you don't eat meat, you will not have much to choose from. I guess I would stay at this hotel again, but not for the price I paid. I researched my options very carefully, and I beieve that I got the best of what was available. Others at the conference stayed at the Sheraton, which is under a major renovation, and the Westin. Neither excited my colleagues.

Also, they have robes (one in bathroom, one in closet) in the room. The beds in the room are very soft. They give you SIX !!!! pillows on the bed. The \"Grand Bed\" also uses down comforters, etc).

Orange juice is included with the continental breakfast ( they will ask you which kind of juice you want). The free continental breakfast, included with the business plan rooms, are not continental breakfast.

What I mean is that the hotel itself is first class; beautifully appointed in an excellent location. But unlike most properties of this level, the Grand Hyatt has a truly down to earth, friendly staff that puts guests of all stripes at ease. The hotel is located in a major commerical district, on the same block as a Cheesecake Factory and within a few blocks of major department stores and restaurants. Pike's Place is about a 10 minute walk and visible at the end of the street. You could not pick a more perfect location for Seattle. The hotel lobby is fairly intimate, but done in a very chic style. Its a hushed sort of atmosphere, with a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse on the left and a full-service Starbucks (not just a kiosk) to the right. Per my request, my room was a corner suite overlooking the harbor and the Space Needle. The view was absolutely stunning on both ends. The room itself was roomy enough, split into two parts--a sitting area and a bedroom area. The bathroom was very large, with a separate glass shower. The set up was good because it allowed you to keep the bedroom area uncluttered. The shades do indeed close electronically. The bed itself was comfortable, on the plush side. The hotel was quiet, save for some street noise even on a high floor. It was not disruptive. Interior insulation appeared to be good--we never heard our neighbors. If I have a complaint about the room decor, its only that a few pieces of furniture looked a little worn--out of place in that setting. Also, I was a bit surprised that the televisions were the old fashioned kind rather than flat screen. That's hardly a complaint, just an observation that similiar properities have upgraded. Overall, the room was stylish and inviting. I am not a fan of valet parking, and I typically feel a bit out of place dealing with hotel staff at better hotels. The Grand Hyatt was an atypical experience for me. Everyone right down to the valet staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. This is the kind of place that within a day or staying there, every staff member you encounter greets you by name. The valet car service was prompt and efficient, and nobody was trolling for tips (though in this case I didn't mind giving them, they were earned). The advice was good and unpretentious. Be advised that this hotel sometimes is the home for major sports teams. During my stay, the Boston Red Sox were there, which was a major attraction for me and my wife. That meant there were some autograph seekers and the like outside the hotel, but the hotel had security to make sure that only registered guests were inside the lobby and interacting with the players. Overall, the Grand Hyatt Seattle is an excellent hotel that I highly recommend. I would have a hard time returning to Seattle and NOT staying there, simply because the standard has been set so high that I'm certain there's nowhere else that can match it.

The rollaway bed for our son arrived very quickly. The spacious marble bathroom had double basins, a huge shower & great water pressure and was stocked with products we actually enjoyed using. We found our room to be uncomfortably warm at night, but we later discovered this to be the case in more or less every hotel we stayed. We are from Queensland, so maybe we keep our air conditioning too cold at home!

The lounge served breakfast each morning, complimentary all-day drinks and evening canap\u00e9s. The food was well presented and the selection offered was good. All the staff were professional and courteous and any queries or requests were acted upon immediately. The Hyatt is very well located close to the main shopping precinct. It also has the usual suspects located within the premises, including of course, a Starbucks (which was handy, because we can\u2019t stand the \u2018creamer\u2019 they supply in US hotels, so we never use the coffee machines in the rooms) The only jarring note was the rather Orwellian set-up with the mini-bar. The fridges are equipped with pressure sensors, and you are changed for a product as soon as you pick it up, regardless of whether you put it back down again or not. It might make restocking easier for the staff, but it is totally user-unfriendly for guests who simply want to chill their own bottle of water. Taxi-fare from the airport was around $40 including the tip, but the hotel also has a shuttle that stops right out front to take you to the (clean, bright, and well serviced) airport. We tried the shuttle on the way out and it worked out fine, and way cheaper than a cab. We loved Seattle. The Pike markets and the waterfront lend it its own unique personality. We felt perfectly safe, and it was very easy to find our way around.

The gentleman who took us to our room was pleasant and very informative of the area. He showed us all the features of our room. Thirty minutes after being in the room we received a letter under the door explaining that the water to the hotel would be cut off at midnight and back on at 4 am. We did not consider this a problem as they stated they were flushing the system. At 10 pm we received another letter under the door that was a duplicate of the second letter. We woke up at 6:30 am as we were heading to LA on Amtrak that left at 10 am. We found that we did not have any water. We called downstairs and was informed that we would have water in 30 minutes. At 7:15 we still had no water but they offered to send bottled water to our room, which we declined. Ten minutes later the doorbell rang and we found 2 bottles of water sitting at the door. We were not sure what they expected us to do with 2 - 16 oz. bottles of water. At 7:30 we called the desk again about the water and was told they had water in the gym and we could take showers there. We asked if they had hot water and was told yes. Imagine our surprise when we got there and found they only had cold (ice cold) water. I then went down to the desk and was told that we would have water to our room by 8:30 that it was a long process to get the water throughout the hotel. I explained that we had to leave by then to which they did not reply. By the time I got back to my room, there was 2 more bottles of water sitting at the door. We immediately packed out belongings, we down to checkout and asked that they call a taxi for us. They told us they would get us a taxi outside to just go on out. They also offered us bottled water to take with us. Once outside we were informed they should have called for a taxi inside, so the gentleman outside was standing in the road trying to flag down a taxi instead of someone going inside to call. There was a gentleman who drives his a personal Town Car that was there waiting to pickup passengers for airport flights (no reservations required with this gentleman and he charges the same as a taxi) he volunteered to take us to the Amtrak station. We wanted to get away before they offered us more bottled water so we took him up on it. As we drove away the gentleman was still in the road trying to flag down a taxi while his co-workers watched. The wonderful gentleman with the Town Car charged us $5.00. We gave him $20.00 because we would have paid that or more for taxi.

We had a very nice one bedroom suite on the club level with incredible panaromic views of the sound, the peninsula and but for an unfortunately located building next door, Mt. Ranier. The clunky tv in the armoire was a bit of a surprise in this context; the room cries out for a plasma on the wall--not that we would have turned it on with the views! However, the restaurant and lounge situation keeps this hotel from the 5 star level. First, if you think Ritz Carlton when you hear club level, forget it. You pay for what you might order from the extremely limited and basic drink menu, even for a diet coke, and the hor d'oeurve service is,well, unimpressive. There is only one restaurant and lounge in the hotel, the Ruth's Chris Steakhouse located next door (with an entrance from the hotel lobby). If you want a quiet drink, it is noisy and crowded and filled with people who perhaps have been there too long. If you want breakfast, you get a limp one page xerox of your egg choices.

My company was doing a show at the convention center, half a block away. I chose the Grand Hyatt out of all the convention hotels because I had stayed there once in 2004 and loved it. This visit was even better, because I was there for a full week. Customer service in all areas of the hotel is excellent. When I'm on a business trip, I want to know the hotel staff will help me fix anything that goes wrong. I wanted a place with meeting space, in case I needed it at the last minute. I had a corner suite on the 23rd floor, with a view of the water from one of the smaller windows. I am now certain I don't want to live in Seattle, because it rained or was darkly overcast almost the whole time, in May! Luckily we were up high enough to have lots of (gray) light. The housing prices in California are depressing, but not as depressing as Seattle weather. I love the interior design, which uses natural materials in a modern, somewhat masculine way. The bathroom has a deep tub and separate shower. The light over the tub is on a dimmer. It would be better if all the lights were dimmable. I love the lavender and citrus-scented toiletries, but I know some people can't stand the fragrance. I was disappointed that the towels are kind of rough. I didn't remember that from my previous visit. I can't seem to find soft hotel towels anywhere but at Four Seasons. I had dinner with a friend at Ruth's Chris Steak House in the hotel. Yummy! Gigantic onion rings, flavorful sirloin steak, grilled asparagus...I had no room for dessert. I also had drinks with a client in the bar at Ruth's. They close at midnight on weekdays, which surprised me. They didn't rush us out, though. There are two movie theaters within a block of the hotel. There are three shopping malls within four blocks, but they're nothing too exciting if you live in the Bay Area. The corner suite comprised a sitting area, a narrow hallway, and the bedroom. The sitting area and bedroom are not separated by a door. On one side of the hallway are two sets of double doors, for the closet. The other side has the door to the bathroom. Like the bathroom door in a standard room, it's wood with glass inserts that are translucent but not transparent. There's none of that nonsense you see in W hotels, with their see-through windows between the bedroom and bathroom. I decided against a Regency Club room, because there are lots of fabulous places to eat in Seattle (Flying Fish, Etta's, Salumi). I did use the gym a couple times. For a windowless room, it is very attractive, in the same style as the rest of the hotel. I used the elliptical, treadmill, and free weights. They also have stairsteppers and weight machines. The cardio machines have tv screens. I especially liked the small fridge with chilled, moist towels. There's a watercooler and a tiny gym lounge with magazines. Some of my colleagues couldn't understand why I'd want to stay four extra nights in Seattle after my three-day business trip, but the Hyatt's customer service and luxurious beauty made it worth the money and time. There are many things to like about this place, but the staff is their strength.

We hardly saw any other guests. My only complaints: The bedroom area was a little small, and while the bed was comfortable, I think they used down or some other fiber in a feather bed that had sharp edges poking through the linens. That sometimes made for a few pricks when laying in bed. (It wasn't enough of a problem that I couldn't sleep though.)

The shower is huge, enclosed in glass and the shower head has multiple spray settings and is high enough for someone over six feet to enjoy. Bathrobes, lots of soft towels and lovely bath soaps, gel, shampoo and conditioner. Good complimentary coffee and teas. The beds are comfortable with down toppers, pillows and comforters. Don't let the mini bar scare you. If you touch anything, but don't use it, you can let the front desk know that you did not use the item. Just avoid it if you don't plan on using anything and ask for a complimentary mini frige to be hooked up in the bathroom for you for your own beverages you can get at any drugstore or mini mart in town. I recommend you get the Regency Club upgrade. With this option, you get a key to enter the club on the 27th floor 24 hours a day to get coffee, tea, cocoa and soft drinks.

Worst experience ever!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3727686", "Content": "We made reservations for an Emerald Suite at the Grand Hyatt for the night prior to and the night of our July 1 wedding. Several times prior to the date of check-in, my husband called to confirm various details (we wanted a bottle of champagne on ice for our July 1 wedding night, etc.). I checked in to the hotel on the day prior to our wedding. I requested the specific suite we looked at, which had a view of the Space Needle and the water. We were told we could not request a specific room until check-in, and when I did request it at check-in, I was told that was the room we had. It was not. We had a water and a city view. Still a nice view, but not at all what we had expected or were promised (the Space Needle and water view was requested). When we asked the bellboys (there were 2 standing around and no other guests in the lobby at the time) to help us with our bags, which were in our car in the garage, they argued as to who had to help us. Finally, one lost the argument and escorted us with a cart to our car. Upon arriving at our car, without saying a word the whole way, the bellboy threw our luggage onto the cart and haphazardly threw my wedding dress on top of it all. He then proceeded to bang the cart into the wall twice on the way back down to the lobby with no apology. When we got to the lobby, my mother asked him to step away from the cart and not touch our stuff. He started to argue with her. We got a different bellboy to take our items up to my room. When I got to the room I discovered that not only were we not given the room we had asked for (and been told we received), but the champagne for the wedding night was waiting on ice on the coffee table. I took it off the ice, called the appropriate number and asked them to please re-place it on ice on Friday, the night of our wedding. The night prior to the wedding, I ordered room service. A very simple order. After waiting for almost an hour for the food to arrive, it was incorrect. On our wedding night, my husband and I returned to the room to find the champagne where I had left it the day prior, on the end table next to the couch...no ice. At 8:53AM on the morning after our wedding, housekeeping rang the doorbell to the suite. Check out was not until noon. This was the part that upset me the most. 8:53 am the morning after our wedding! Not only did housekeeping ring the doorbell (the door to the suite is on the opposite end and in another room than the bedroom), they proceeded to enter. Repeat, this is the morning after our wedding. Ah! Needless to say, at this point we were ready to vacate this room that we paid way, way too much money for. The bellboy arrived to help with our baggage and it was the one from the day before that I had had such a bad experience with. He took our luggage and rolled it outside to the valet area. He left it and did not tell the valet which car it was to be loaded into (meanwhile, we were inside checking out). Upon check-out, I shared these experiences with the employee at the desk, he apologized and credited the room service back. After all of the various mess-ups that occurred, I will never stay at that hotel again. Not only that, but whenever I drive by it (I am from the Seattle area), I will be reminded of what a horrible experience I had there in the days surrounding my wedding. Thankfully, my husband and I were too happy with each other to let it ruin our wedding night. I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy.

The entertainment book provides many buy one get one free coupons to local attractions including the art museum, Victoria Clipper, aquarium, and others.

The rooms are also fully automated, yet the wood and stone furniture and accents in an almost Frank Lloyd Wright style sustain a discreet warmth. Service was personal and excellent, as well. Our only complaint was that the Hyatt in its literature and web page had advertised free high speed internet; they were charging 9.95/day when we checked in. This seemed slightly like bait and switch, especially when the binder listing the amenities stated that internet access was free. The least they could have done was waive the charge for those who booked before the fee was instituted. However, being able to print documents from one's laptop in the room directly to a printer, and being able to pick up the documents at the front desk easily (at 50 cents a page), was quite convenient for those who do not have a mobile printer.

The Hyatt national reservation desk, where I was routed, was helpful and checked with the hotel directly for availability.

I was surprised to get a call back as promised with a confirmation of the room and room number. Check in was smooth as we had confirmed via telephone. Our room was exactly as promised - great view of both downtown Seattle (Needle and all) and a view towards Pike Place Market and the waterfront. Comfortable king bed with down pillow top bedding on the mattress. Remote controlled shades on the windows. Very luxurious bathroom with large shower and tub. All amenities including professional hair dryer, iron and board, in room safe, 2 TVs, complimentary umbrella, coffee maker, and plush robes (for use in room - or to purchase for taking home - $50 per robe).

Examples - $13 omelettes, $12 for salmon appetizers, $12 for waffles. We didn't check the dinner menu as we assumed the prices were much more for that meal and we had already planned to eat at the waterfront (which was actually reasonable and great views) and on Bainbridge Island.
