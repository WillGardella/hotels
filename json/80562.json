It is a jaunt to downtown (about 2.5 miles), but it's a pretty walk. The Old Town Trolley does make a stop here in the morning and is a great way to explore the city.

The Bay Tower used to be a Ramada...and still looks like it. We were unable to check in early, were told they put a pending on our room to clean first, so we could check in after flying for 8 hours, and would call us. They never called, so we checked in at 2:50 pm, only to be given a room we did not choose or pay for. After arguing, they moved us. Then, cleaning service did not come the next day while we were out of our room between 9:45am and 3:15pm. I called guest services to alert of this - did nothing except bring up fresh towels. Then, cleaning service called us because we had a do not disturb sign on the door after 3:15pm when they wanted to clean. Housekeeping also banged on our door three times the morning of check-out. The hotel charges an arm and leg for each LOCAL phone call, do notice the little sheet of paper near the phone explaining this...something I did not notice. They charge for the Internet - two prices, daily, and charge for the self parking. The bar charged $70 for 5 beers and two, small bottles of water. The in-room convenient prices were equally as expensive. The room was their deluxe king, on the 8th floor facing the bay. Nice view, nice little balcony, which was the only thing we enjoyed - although the weather was unseasonably cold, extremely windy and rainy. The bed was uncomfortable and the furniture looked old and dingy. I did ask for an adjustment on the bill, but guest services would not budge and did not seem to care at all. I also used the spa at the main building. They gave me a key to a locker that didn't work. After fiddling with it for 5 minutes or so, I asked for a new locker and explained the lock was malfunctioning. The staff person said, \"yes, a work order has been called in...\" I explained she should not have given me that locker then. She didn't seem to care. I was the only person in the spa. So, I have stayed at the Loew's Coronado for the same price and had much better service and rooms. I chose to stay here for a more convenient location. Not worth saving the 10-12 minute drive.

Our children looked forward to their talks with Doug at breakfast. The first day he asked us how smart are kids were and of course like every parent we say they are brilliant. Doug then presented them with a riddle and they answered correctly. He was happy about that. Our kids wrote him a note when we left with a picture of his favorite animal in the zoo an okapi.

I was therefore displaced from the hotel where my conference was and had to find my own transportation to the conference. This inconvenience is only magnified due to my overall dissatisfaction with the service (actually lack of) that the hotel staff here provided. To top it off, there is no WiFi in the rooms and to get internet is through an ethernet cable which is $12 per 24 hours and I got overcharged for using the in-room food bar.

The property sits on the marina and across the street from the airport, BUT this is not a typical airport hotel !! It is somewhere between hotel and resort property probably partly because of the expansive grounds and being on the marina. The rooms in the Marina tower are a tad on the smaller side, but have balconies and in excellent condition. Rooms in the Bay tower are a bit larger. The higher floors have wonderful views no matter which building you are in or which direction you are facing. Even the lower floors I imagine would have nice views as there is nothing around the immediate property but marina or bay. Full Starbucks in the lobby is very convenient for morning nibbles or whatever coffee concoction you like best. There is also a full service restaurant with a very nice breakfast buffet.

Shuttle runs to and from airport every 15 minutes. Check in was flawless, quick and painless. Our club level connecting rooms in the Marina tower were great for our family. Typical Sheraton rooms and exactly what we expected. One bonus are that the rooms come with a balcony. Our rooms overlooked the Marina and we really enjoyed looking at the boats and people watching from the balcony. We used the main pool just below the restaurant. It wasn't too warm that day outside (60 ish) so actually my kids used the pool while we sat and watched. We ordered room service delivered to the pool deck and it arrived quickly and was quite tasty. As mentioned in other rooms, food and beverage are pretty expensive, and there are not any other options within walking distance, so plan ahead. The upgrade to the club floor was worth it for the appetizers in the evening and the nice breakfast spread in the morning. Only downer is that this Club level does not offer complementary adult beverages, but rather a cash bar. I was hoping the cash bar prices would be a bit less than the regular bar, but they were still on the expensive side. With that being said the staff working in the Club Lounge were great. We enjoyed our time in the lounge. Took a cab into San Diego proper for a few hours....15 bucks each way, so reasonable if you are not wanting to rent a car.

Lights above the mirror were about 5'8\" high, which wasn't conducive to a slightly taller person who has to shave. Fixtures were rusty, shower curtain was too long (about 4\" on the bath floor, inside the bath), and the sink was once-overed with crud collecting against the wall below the mirror. It was pretty much unacceptable and if I had arrived at a decent time or normal state of mind I would have definitely requested a room change. The on-site dining charged resort rates for food, which I feel based on the overall condition of things is overpriced. I did not order any of the food.

We were there for the graduation of my son from USMC boot camp, and the lights went out all over the entire city that afternoon. Literally, no one had power. We were there with our younger children, and I had so many concerns over where we would feed them, if we would even be able to check into the hotel, etc. The temperature that day was around 100 degrees. Well, we got to the Sheraton, and the line to check in was long because they only had 2 computers working off generators and all these people were trying to check in whose flights had been cancelled (it's right by the airport). The staff were walking around handing out water bottles to all of us and light sticks because there was no power in the rooms. The cold water was such a blessing and I just thought the light sticks were such a nice thing to do. Then, if you can believe it, they had a cold buffet set up in the dining area that evening that had cold cuts, cheeses, pasta salad, green salad, etc. I was so relieved to know my kids would get to eat! They had very few lights on, but the servers were friendly despite the circumstances they were working in, and the presentation offered was amazing considering they only had a short time to put this together and make sure their guests could have something to eat. I felt taken care of. Really. Of course the rooms had no lights, but it was clean and comfortable. The sun had gone down and we had a nice breeze from the bay through our balcony's sliding glass door, so it actually was cool in our room by the time we went to bed. The power came back on around midnight thankfully. In summary, as a mom being away from home in a city I didn't know with no power, with my young children, I can't say enough about how well taken care of I felt by the Sheraton.

The evening snacks are great and tasty. Examples include fried chicken. The breakfast spread is adequate. Bagels, eggs, oatmeal, fruits, small selection of ham and cheese, juices, tea/coffee.

Its literally two minutes to the airport. - Rooms are not luxurious but very comfortable. Decor is reasonable, in blue. Negatives - the hotel does not have good restaurants. The restaurants share one kitchen, and depending on your luck, the wait and service for food can range from 5 to 25 minutes. Its a big drawback. Having said that, the service, when you do get it, is reasonable. The waitstaff try very hard to please. The fitness center is reasonable with a wide range of equipment.

We had a nice little patio with a couple of chairs, but the view was of a wall below the parking lot.

Going down town to eat got old quickly due to traffic and crowds and we found ourselves spending more and more time in the Point Loma, an area just north of the hotel. The whirlpool was very nice and big, 10 people can comfortably fit. The room was nicely decorated and the beds were comfortable. It's not a Westin heavenly bed but it is far from the low end. There is airport noise but it's mostly during the day when we were away so it's not an issue. Our room was overlooking the marina (away from the airport) so the other side might be different. $22/day parking is very high and you have no viable alternative. It was interesting that long term airport parking in the area was $10/day. My one complaint is the price of parking. Seems very excessive and should be included in room rates.

The first night during my stay I couldn't sleep at all, The A/C in the room kept turning off when the room temperature reached 65. It's hard for me to sleep in complete silence! I need the A/C to stay on! I never experienced a hotel's A/C system that doesn't let the customer keep the thing ON! The next day I had to call a mechanic, and he eventually performed some \"super duper\" A/C thermostat tricks and found a way to put the system to 60. and it stayed ON and cold, finally! Why this hotel doesn't let guests have this simple ability is beyond me. The fun doesn't stop here, the next night in my stay I couldn't get the internet to work on my computer. I called tech support. The mechanic had to come to my room and replace not just the cable cord, but the modem to! Who knows why, but after they replaced all of the defective equipment I finally got online. However this hotel is special! You get to choose 2 speeds! One is the regular speed at like $11, and other is an absurd price of $20 (high speed). I opted for the regular speed and took a chance. BIG MISTAKE! The speed has been the slowest speed of ANY hotel I have every stayed at! It was slow, almost like dialup internet access slow. It was probably like DSL or slower. It was sad. It was so sloooow I got so frustrated I turned my Android phone into a mobile hotspot, and guess what my Tmobile data speed was much faster than the hotel's internet speed, This hotel needs just to offer one speed, and get rid of their slow speed. However with all of the negative experiences I had at this place there were some positives to note: PLUSES: Room services, it was pretty tasty and I enjoyed the shrimp cocktail, and spicy buffalo wings. However, the chicken tenders tasted like cardboard, it was horrible. View: it's gorgeous. I felt so relaxed and peaceful here. And I enjoyed watching the christmas boat light parade as well. Room itself and bed: the bed was pretty comfy, and the room was appointed nice. I used the mini bar a lot, and thought it was convinient even though it is pricey. Anyways I am rating my stay only 2 stars because the negatives of my experience far outweighted the positives. I hope this hotel fixed their hot water issues, and also please fix your ridicolous internet speeds and only offer 1 speed. And let guests FULLY control their A/C.

The premises are nice, the rooms are clean, it's close to the airport. BUT, when you start adding it all up and looking at it as a total package, that's when the criticism comes in... I married my wife here in August 2011. Overall, I was very happy with their wedding packages. For only 105$ per person we got a great buffet dinner, 4 HOURS OF OPEN BAR (yay!) and someone who somewhat was a wedding coordinator. I really have no complaints about the wedding stuff. Everything went great, the staff were very helpfule with the setup. The only thing is that some stuff went missing, but that could have been our guests for all I know. Or an honest mistake, and could have gotten thrown away. The room they threw in was really two adjoining rooms and they just opened the door. Hardly a suite by any definition. They were nice rooms, but not a suite. If you get married here, make sure to dicuss that. The nice thing is that we ended up with a view of the bay. Either side of the hotel is not bad, pretty much all the views are good. Also, they charge for parking. If you are the bride and groom, you can get comped, but they will charge all of your guests, and parking is not cheap. If you get married here, they have some pretty good opportunities for photos. We took ours with the San Diego skyline in the background. If you are NOT getting married here then this hotel is ok if you are on business and have a car. Like I said, rooms are clean, etc, but there is not a coffee shop nearby, or a breakfast place, and room service is expensive. If you are in SD to have a good time, I'd suggest staying in Little Italy or the Gaslamp. The Gaslamp will be noisier, but is closer to fun bars/clubs. Little Italy is also fun, but a bit quieter, better for a family. This hotel is 3-5 miles from the Gaslamp and harbor tours, not great if you are here trying to see stuff. But if your goal is to be close to the airport, and you have no desire to leave the room, this hotel might be right for you. Even though room service is expensive, they have alternate options for dining close by. There are some restaurants on harbor island that are withing half mile to a mile away.

The biggest problem i had/AM HAVING, is PARKING. Okay, so in san diego, you can expect to pay for parking almost everywhere, including hotels with high rates like this place; im not going to hold that against them. What i WILL hold against them, is that on the third night i was here (today actually) we left to go to Sea World and to sight see, and came back exhausted, only to find out the side of the parking lot that we had been parking, at (WHICH WE HAD TO PAY FOR MIND YOU)was closed for some highly irritating event. we ended up having to park on the other side furthest from our room, and while the walk was not too horrible, it was not short either, and add to that being exhausted, and having to park in a crappy place after paying a fairly high amount for parking ($22 PER night), i was NOT happy. But what ensures that i will NOT stay here again, is that NOBODY SAID OR POSTED ANYTHING...ANYTHING about this event, and about that portion of the parking lot being closed. And if they did it must have been like a few minutes before the event. Certainly not the night before, not on their website, and no one at the front dest brought it to our attention, at any point. Had we been informed we would have at LEAST been ready to walk a bit and plan accordingly on our sightseeing trip. Add to that the parking staff outside taking an attitude of hostility to us when we inquired as to why we could not park where we had been, and why nothing had been posted about it. Very rude. We did not as a result bother going out to eat, out of worrying about dealing with parking...great way to end a trip. Im not a person who generally holds hotels to unreasonable standards, but for the price paid, and the parking that i paid for (even if just self parking), i think i should have been informed somehow that parking would be a mess on my last night, so i could have planned accordingly and i dont think i should have had to have delt with snotty rude parking attendants. When the manager was approached about the parking situation, he told me quite clearly that parking PARKING SPACES ARE NOT GUARANTEED...but said he THOUGHT there should'nt be a problem. I honestly think it is unprofessional for a hotel to not know its own capacity, or amount of people coming to an event. The manager did offer to valet the car free of charge, bit it still put a cramp on our trip All in all the place is NOT worth the price paid...they charge for virtually everything, and paying for self parking does in no way (unless you pay more for valet) guarantee a spot...something that was not made clear at booking. If you are here for leisure they will not care about your experience. Their special events clearly are more important than the experience for an individual average joe guest; i dont hold it against them; they are a business and big events make them money, but just be aware of this. For the price, unless you are here on Business i would not recomend staying here. The location IS good (if you have a car) but again parking isn't guaranteed even though they do charge you. Check-in staff are very friendly and helpful but the parking staff is hit and miss. The main reason i cant recommend this hotel, is because its lack of consideration of guests who pay for parking, by failing to inform them clearly of events that may cause issues leaving or arriving", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona", "Title": "\u201cWish our 2 Nights were 20 !\u201d", "Author": "OBGAL", "ReviewID": "UR120632355", "Content": "We were attending a family wedding, and our room had been established for us for One night, we added a night to just relax after the wedding and take in the beauty of the area.

Both times I was there for conventions and as others note the hotel is across the road from the airport and a ways from downtown. Since my partner and I walk this wasn't a huge issue. We simply walked the couple of miles downtown, a lovely walk, and took taxis to Balboa Park and Old Town. Within walking distance of the hotel are two restaurants, C-Level and Island Prime, that are consistent winners for us. On to the hotel. Check-in was a breeze. We arrived almost two hours early and just walked into a room, very nice. The property includes a few different buildings and I think may include some longer term and time share units in places. The Marina Tower is in the main part of the hotel. The Bay Tower is a bit of a stroll across the marina. We've only stayed in the Marina Tower and have been glad we did given its proximity to the restaurant, etc. We've eaten at the restaurant, service was good and food just ok. Quinn's, the on site tavern and eatery seems to have better food and has a decent selection of draft beers and nice ambiance (overlooks the marina and pool, or you can watch sports on any of a number of tvs). There are 3 tennis courts that we used every day and in two visits I don't think I've ever seen anyone else use them. Good condition, decent courts. There are two swimming pools and two hot tubs. We tended to like the smaller hot tub near the tennis courts. Unfortunately both the pools and hot tubs close at 10pm. The first time we stayed here, just over a year ago, that closing time was strictly enforced so even though we were a quiet couple in our 50's just relaxing we got chased. This time when 10pm and the guards rolled around we were sharing the hot tub with a pretty rowdy group of Canadians who successfully lobbied for one more 15 minute round in the tub. I thought it was an improvement for the guards to give folks a break. Re the rooms, they're very comfortable, not new but not run down either. The bathroom was nice though we had an issue with the bathroom sink draining slowly. We reported it and it was fixed immediately - then we were given a $50 \"experience adjustment\" credit for our trouble. We used it at the gift shop. Frankly I attribute that to the power of media like TripAdvisor - to avoid a bad review, and sure enough here I am recommending the hotel rather than whining about a slow sink. A couple other gems here - there are two fire pits by the marina that are just plain cool, and rocking chairs suitable for just relaxing by the fire. This property has lots of spaces for couples to just drift hand in hand. The grounds are well maintained and it's an expansive property. We took cabs to Balboa Park and Old Town, about $15 each way each time, and walked downtown. Other friends at the same convention also walked downtown - though all of us are walkers, we're also all in our 50's and 60's so don't be too afraid to take it on. Leaving - nothing is easier. Free airport shuttle. Oh re the meeting rooms, etc., standard hotel issue. With the exception of the main banquet the food was unremarkable, however, at our main lunch banquet everything was a notch above usual conference food (a wonderful tomato cream soup served hot for example).

The room was spotless as was the rest of the property, and the landscaping surrounding the hotel was very nice. If I remember correctly, there was also a sidewalk between the hotel and water that you could walk around the marina on. Depending on when you stay, and if you have AAA or some other discount plan, you can get a reasonable price for this hotel. At other times, the price can be double. We are going on a cruise in December and I was anxious to book this hotel again for our pre-cruise stay. However, there is a convention going on that week and when I first checked it out, the price had skyrocketed. The second time I checked, there were no rooms available. The only reason I am giving this hotel 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is not within walking distance to restaurants, and the hotel restaurant is pricey, as expected. We did go ahead and eat breakfast at the restaurant which was excellent, but again, it was not a \"breakfast included\" type of hotel and the cost for breakfast was about $15 per person, I think.

We were given two vouchers for complimentary breakfast for our stay, for which we were very grateful, though once we were seated in the restaurant and given menus we weren't quite sure what we were allowed to choose from.

The room also has a fridge, but only for the rip off minibar, you weren't allowed to use it. Not only did it quote exorbitant prices on the mini bar it also had a RESTOCKING fee in the fine print.

During the previous four nights of our trip we stayed in a WONDERFUL hotel right in downtown San Diego. The price of this Sheraton vs. the downtown hotel were virtually the same, so I expected the same quality hotel & experience. Boy, was I wrong. First of all, the Sheraton is out on Harbor Island, a strip of land that is apparently still being deveoped for tourists and doesn't contain much of anything except for a few hotels. We were dropped off at the hotel by a cab driver around 5PM and literally felt STRANDED for the rest of the evening. There are two restaurants inside the Sheraton, both of which are offensively overpriced. We left the hotel in search of food, and after walking over a mile, found a gas station-like store that sold prepackaged sandwiches. We trudged back to the hotel and reluctantly went to the cheaper of the two restaurants inside. We both ordered $16 hamburgers. That would be $16 each. The food was average at best and the service was neglectful at best. Definitely a frustrating venture. Secondly, I'm still confused about this hotel and what part of it we stayed in. The main entrance of the hotel is beuatiful and plush looking. When we checked in, we were instructed to follow a long hallway to the right. At the end of this hallway we stepped into an elevator foyer that looked completely different from the main part of the hotel. The carpet and wallpaper were old and discolored. It was like we all of a sudden were transported to an old motel. Once we reached our floor, it still felt like a motel, not a \"nice\" hotel - the hallway smelled stale, and there were several room service food trays laying throughout the hallway. Without even entering our room yet, I felt ripped off. I was immediately wishing we had just booked another night at our downtown hotel that was GORGEOUS and equally priced. Along the same lines of this confusing split-personality of the hotel - there are two pools outside. One is luxurious and updated. The other, right next to it, is older and smaller. Our hotel key would not allow access to the nicer pool. We were apparently relegated as \"second-class\" and were only allowed key access to the smaller pool. This was all VERY confusing and practically embarassing. There were no signs of explanation as to the difference between the two pools that were RIGHT next to each other. I will say that the room itself at the Sheraton was very lovely. It actually felt updated, clean, and new. I loved the color-scheme. Because there was NOTHING to do on Harbor Island, we just got in bed early and watched t.v. for the rest of the night. Overall, I would NOT recommend this hotel if you are in San Diego for more than just a layover. If you do not have a car, cab rides to and from downtown are about $14 each way. Although that is cheaper than a hamburger on Harbor Island, it is not worth the price just to get far enough away from the hotel to find something to do. There are PLENTY of hotels in downtown San Diego that are the exact same price and are INCREDIBLY nicer.

Nothing fantastic but all new and stylish. On opening the blackout curtains I had an interesting view of the airport, the carpark and alot of the marina. I love boats so I was happy. You could see a couple of battleships and an aircraft carrier from my room. There was also a little private balcony which was fab for smoking cigars on and for sunbathing - great suntrap! It is MUCH less noosy than one might expect. We had booked club rooms which meant that we had breakfast in the club lounge included. This is great since you get a good continental breakfast in the lounge, which is nice and relaxed with an AMZING view across the marina and out towards the sea. It is quite difficult to actually find and access but worth it when you arrive. One very good thing about the club lounge is that you get free wifi (you only get wired internet in the rooms) so I chatted to Mrs M-B and the kids via Skype and could show off the great views too. The club lounge is quiet and relaxing and if I was not at a conference I would have chilled out there most of the time. We din't eat in the hotel other than on the first night at the sports bar, but we did order many drinks from there. Annoyingly they do not deliver drinks to the outside flame pits where you could chill out in the sun - we had to constantly try and carry trays of drinks through doors and down stairs. They also don't allow glass outside, but we didn't find that out until the last day! The hotel is not exactly in the centere of town but it is very easy to get a cab to where ever you wanted to go, although they did add up eventually. It is nice and quick to get back to the airport (5 mins). If you have things to do, such as conferencing, or sitghtseeing, then this hotel is great. If you booked it just to chill out in the pool, I suspect that you would be a bit bored after the first day. Hopefully I will come back to San Diego, but if I was given the choice and I was a single traveller I would stay at the W Hotel which is more central and funkier.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "alberta", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel near the airport\u201d", "Author": "calalb", "ReviewID": "UR119461857", "Content": "6$ cab ride or free shuttle to airport.

We ate breakfasts and lunches on a lawn outside the conference center, which was really nice. Watch out for heels sinking into the grass and slightly damp chairs in the morning, but I enjoyed it. The bar food was standard hotel fare. Only thing that raised my eyebrows is during a snack break, they served sports energy bars--as snacks! I scooped up a couple because I would only eat these on a 7-mile or longer run--they were packed with glucose/fructose/sucrose. Believe me, most people at the conference did not need to be eating athletic fuel bars as a snack between sedentary meeting sessions.

Lured by the mention of \"billions of dollars in renovations, I expected -- for the money I spent per night, a luxury hotel experience. Let's start with the bathroom - very cramped and the \"soaking tub\" was a small plastic molded tub that only a child could bathe it. The light switches were put in very crooked. There was, I think, a hole in the wall that had a weird, hand cut plastic sheet over it. It was not enitrely clean and neither was the rest of the room. Weird bed layout had your bed FACING a huge mirror which mean you had not chocie but to see yourself everytime you glanced up from a book if reading in bed or when watching TV. I always test the honesty of hotel staff but leaving a dollar bill on the floor. In the hunderd times before that I had done this, the bill was always neatly placed on a piece of furniure. Not this time. Trash was not removed from my room, and it was very clear from debris on the rug that it wasn't vacuumed. The direct line to room service often did not work; they did not answer, and the front desk would say they would call me back, which they only did 50% of the time. The food was barely passable, and I stayed at a 4 Season in April that charged LESS for really amazing food with such gracious service. I approve of adding a percentage onto the bill automatically so wait staff can be properly tipped, but why was there also an additional $3 food delivery charge added on to the obligatory 16% tip? They advertise their link in service as being this great benefit, but what it means is you need to spend $18 a day for online service in your room or you lug your computer down to the lobby with the worn furniture to work. The ballyhooed TV wake up service did not work at all; thank God I set up a back up with my iPad of I would've missed meetings.

The hotel property is quite nice and even though it is right across the street from the airport, the airport noise is not a factor. There is no free parking at this hotel, only valet or self parking and it is fairly steep per day ($22 for self parking when I stayed) which add up quickly. There are in and out privileges however. The hotel lobby is beautiful and check-in was smooth as they have several front desk clerks assisting visitors. The rooms are fairly nice, not upscale (not sure it is quite a 4 star hotel), but were clean and bright and had no funky smell like a lot of hotel rooms. The beds and pillows were wonderful and my friend and I kept wondering how we could buy some of those pillows! I did not appreciate the lack of follow through with the check-in staff. I originally booked 4 days through Priceline about a month before my trip. A few days later, I decided to add another day (which Priceline lets you do at the same bid price through checkin.) When I checked in at the hotel, they could not find my fifth night. The clerk said she would take care of it. Later that evening, I checked with the front desk and she still had not resolved the problem. The next day, still not resolved. By the 4th day, I had been told by numerous front desk clerks that the matter would be taken care of but it never was resolved by the hotel. I had to call Priceline several times and waste a lot of vacation time to resolve it myself. I can say that after check out, the desk clerk did credit some on my parking bill for the hassle, which was appreciated, but I would have preferred that when their desk staff says they will resolve a problem that they actually resolve it. Another minor irritation was housekeeping. Although housekeeping came every day and replaced the towels and made the beds, they did not actually clean the bathroom which I found odd. My friend who was traveling with me for a few days got her feet really dirty one day and when she took a shower, there were dirty footprints all over the tub. The next morning, they did not clean it. I had to clean it myself with a washcloth and shampoo before I could take a shower. The sink got pretty crusty after a few days and the mirror was also spotted and never cleaned. Also, there was one of 3 bathroom lights burned out when I checked in. I just presumed housekeeping hadn't been in that room for a few days and hadn't notice the light burned out and would change it during my stay. Never changed.

This is what you'd expect. A large \"resort\" hotel not really within walking distance of anything. If you want to go anywhere, expect a cab ride or other means. So it's not too bad, but just not great. The good. It is in a very nice location, near the water (Mission Bay, which is NOT the ocean), and has great views of things like the naval base, the bay, Coronado Bridge, etc. (more on this in a bit). Great walking trails nearby, nice and quiet, decent hotel accomodations, etc. From that standpoint, it's great. And, it is REALLY close to the airport. Decent pools for the kids, and the usual amenities such as gym, Starbucks, etc. The bad. There's little nearby. You are going to travel anywhere, such as Gaslamp, downtown, La Jolla, Qualcomm, Padres, the beach, Corondado, you name it. Also, WHY MAKE ME PAY FOR INTERNET? When are hotels going to learn this is like making us pay for TV in the old days? It's not a sign of being progressive and hip, it's a sign of being out of touch! What's next, making me pay for local calls (cringe)? And, you are stuck most of the time in this hotel, at their mercy with restaurants. If that's okay with you, that's okay. Our room. Without doing anything (I think) to annoy the check-in staff, we got ABSOLUTELY the worst room in this place - room 5135 (don't agree to take this room!!). We didn't complain - were there on business and spent little time there (so management don't reply that we shouldn't have requested - we shouldn't have been put in such a dumpy room to begin with!!), but this was a crappy room. I happened to visit the room of other meeting attendees, including those without Sheraton Club membership, paid same amount, came in later, etc., and they mostly all had significantly better rooms in terms of views. And trust me, it matters at this hotel. Our room (again, 5135 - avoid it!) looked out on a parking lot and a green wall adjacent to tennis courts, while others looked out on the bay, airport landing jets, city skyline (imagine how all this looks at night?). It sucked. And, it smelled of mold - inspection of the air unit outside showed it all mildewed, etc. Not nice at all. The room interior was decent, not much to comment on from there (except the damn paying for internet). It seems to me that lousy rooms should be given out last, not early on during the day - a pet peeve of mine - why doesn't their computer system have some sort of ranking system and give out rooms in terms of some ranking system? Long story short, thanks Sheraton, and I'll certainly remember this room! I do commend them for deducting $5 / night for not having maid service. Great practice, and I hope it shows on the final bill. I like that. The sports bar on premise is pretty good, and food is okay although pricey and service is spotty (what did you expect given this was a self-contained resort hotel). The restaurant is same, except we found service there to be really poor (we complained, and to her credit, waitress took the blame for shoddy service, although she blamed it on a \"large party of 40\" which was there that night - at a hotel that seems to host large parties all the time, thank god there wasn't a party of 400 or we still might be there - and on a Sunday night with few other patrons. You figure for yourself on that one.). Restaurant food was pretty good, but prices were high for poor service. But what do you expect given a hotel with no competition within walking distance?

The next morning on the way to the conference, I mentioned the problem to the Front Desk and they advised they would send Maintenance to fix the problem. I returned to my room at lunch and found the thermostat was displaying in Celsius and the unit was blowing heated air (as in furnace). I called Guest Services who reported that Maintenance reported the problem as fixed. Guest Services scheduled a second visit from Maintenance and I went back to the conference. I returned to the room at dinner and found no evidence of a visit from Maintenance. I contacted Guest Services who advised they had not heard back from Maintenance and would send someone right away. I advised I would be back in the room around 8 PM and if the problem was not fixed the problem would be escalated to the manager. I returned at 8 PM and the problem was not fixed and the room was super hot. I contacted Guest Services who advised Maintenance was on their way. Fernando from Maintenance quickly arrived and within five minutes determined the unit was broken and would only blow heated air until it was repaired. Fernando contacted the Front Desk and advised them to move us to another room and send a bellhop up to assist in the move. I waited 30 minutes (sitting outside on the balcony to stay cool) and no bellhop. I walked down to the Front Desk and spoke with the manager Dana over the phone. Dana guaranteed the bellhop would be up quickly to assist us and she was researching ways to properly compensate me for my unnecessary troubles. We received a call from Sue at Guest Services asking how our new room was (by calling us in our old room?). We advised we are still waiting on a bellhop and keys to the new room. Sue advised she was working on a compensation package for us to make up for the full day off troubles. Thirty minutes later, I went back down to the front desk and received the keys to room 1172 and I moved myself into the new room. I did meet a maid as I was transferring to the new room that was sent to clean my old room (???). We never saw a bellhop, Sue from Guest Services never called back to offer compensation and Dana the manager never called back to offer compensation.

The balcony was great to watch the sunset in the evening and to watch the harbour. The room was immaculate, sparkling clean bathroom. This hotel had a Starbucks on site, there was a outdoor restaurant Shorelines this was amazing the portions were huge. There was the Harbour Edge restaurant which was open from breakfast til late,Martini Tapas bar, then there was the sports bar Quinn's where you could order food til late and a gift shop.Fitness centre, Spa room fee applied to that, the pool areas were excellent two pools/hot tubs. tennis courts, bike rentals, boat rentals.They had kids activities and on Friday and Saturday they had a Dive in Movie which was a good idea you could swim whilst you watched the movie or just relax on a lounger with a drink and a snack. We opted for the Help the Environment this was a good idea you got $5 voucher for everyday you stayed, if you didn't want all your bath towels and sheets changing every day they came in and just made your bed and refilled the mini bar and your complimentary coffee and teas. We used the vouchers towards eating in Shoreline. The location wasn't a problem I had heard and read from others it was out of the way. Yes it's a little out of the way but it is a nice walk along the front towards Downtown (Little Italy, Gaslamp Quarter, Seaport Village) we took the walk at a leisurely pace and it took just over 1/2hr. We didn't hire a car for our 5day visit and to be honest it's not necessary unless you want to visit the beaches near La Jolla and Oceanside. I would recommend the 2day old town trolley tour this helps with finding out about the area and where you want to spend your time exploring in more depth. We did get a taxi back to the hotel this cost $12 with tip and we also took the MTS public transport this was brilliant we took the hotel shuttle bus back to the airport and boarded the 992 bus to Broadway and we took the no 7 bus to the zoo it took just over 40mins and it was $5 for all day per person you can't get better than that. I think rather than pay $22 per day parking at the hotel and whatever the cost to hire your car using the local transport is good. Ralphs grocery store was good to get a few provisions for the day out at the zoo. This was near Market St in Gaslamp area. The history of the Gaslamp area was fascinating,especially if your into Wyatt Earp etc and around the 1800's, the Old Town was also full of History and really enjoyable to wander round and taste some of the local foods and crafts. The zoo is a must..... start early though, this will enable you to see the animals before it gets too hot and there sleep time.There is so much to do and see in Balboa Park it's worth spending the day there.

The service at this hotel was horrible. The night before I arrived, I called to ask if the workstations had MS Office. They could not provide an affirmative answer. Only after I tweeted SPG did I get a firm answer (which is \"yes\" by the way). Every time my friends would call the lobby, the phone would ring endlessly -- literally. Sometimes, they wouldn't answer. I also signed up for green service, meaning they don't clean your room unless you specifically ask. Well, on Friday night, after I got through to the lobby after at least 8 rings, they said they'd remove me from green service and get my room cleaned on Saturday. Well -- that certainly didn't happen. That was just me. My friend, who was getting married, had a cocktail hour at BTL, the lounge in the Bay Tower, on Friday night. They tried to close early on her because they were shorthanded and the bartender had to get home to attend to a personal matter. I feel sorry for the bartender, but this is my friend's wedding!

Two things to be aware of: 1) Not only are the items in the stocked fridge overpriced like usual, you will be charged a 20% stocking fee and taxes on top of the listed price. So a can of Coke listed at $4.50 is really $5.50. 2) It's pretty archaic to use anything other than your cell phone these days, but use the phone in your room at your own risk!!! My wife was feeling under the weather so she stayed in the room while I took my daughter to check out a college she is interested in attending this fall. My wife wanted to check on us but couldn't find her cell so she used the room phone instead...her 2 calls that went straight to voicemail cost us $30!!! I can definitely afford to pay the $35.50 here, but it's the way we were charged that doesn't sit well with me. Charging 12 pack prices for a single can of soda and feeling obligated to add a re-stocking fee and tax on top seems ridiculous. And although the card next to the phone says in small print that direct dialed calls will be charged AT&T operator assisted prices, they forgot to mention \"bend over and look out!\" But if you don't use the room phone and make sure to read all of the fine print, it was a decent place.

We booked on priceline and got the Sheraton SD Hotel and Marine for $81, plux tax, approximately $95 - NOT BAD! If I had paid the $169 rate plus tax, this would have been 2 stars for my liking. Valet - very nice and quick, but $30. Seriously? Are we in NY or SF? You can self park for $22. Check-inand Room- Again very nice, but slow. Although, the girl was new. Because I am a Starwood preferred guest, we were upgraded to the 10th floor overlooking the Marina and the pool which was excellent. The room was adequate the balcony was wonderful. I loved waking up in the morning, reading the paper and sipping on coffee while the sun broke thru the morning cloud layer, truly a fabulous way to start the day! I will say it was a long walk to the ice machine and there were no robes (which is unusual for preferred rooms in most hotels) neither were a big deal. Pool - It was right on the bay and in my opinion beautiful. Not because the pool is that great, but because how can you not love being on a pool, with great weather and on the water? From a nine year old perspective, \"it sucked\". Although, he seemed to enjoy it from the first two hours. But, soon became bored because there was no deep water, slide or other attractions to keep him busy. There were mostly younger kids here, but for a one or two night vacation, perfectly adequate for any age. Pool side service - Was sporatic. It took about twenty minutes to get a menu (2pm) and another twenty to come back for our order. But, once we ordered, the food was very quick and the service was friendly and very accomodating. The food is a mixed bag, my sons pizza was $12 (I think) and was a medium cheese pizza which was way above the standard I am use to for hotel pizzas. He ate half for lunch and the other half for dinner. GREAT VALUE!!!! I ordered a a lemon drink which was awful, but I ordered it that way, so my bad. I was hungry and ordered the fish burrito which was terrible, I couldn't eat it. In all fairness, I was raised in SD and we are home of the Fish Taco, so I should have known better. Oh well. Game Room - Game room, hmmmm. Not exactly what we expected, but turned out ok. The \"game room\" was a room inside the gym that had a wii in it with not really anything games other than the standard package. Also, the parents need to be in the room supervisng the kids at all times (I get that), but wasn't really how I wanted to spend the day, so we moved on to upstairs. This was FABULOUS! My friend joined me at the bar for a glass of vino while my son played the complimentary Xbox with kids that were coming into the lobby (he was 10 feet from me). This entertained him for two hours and he made new friends. Tapatini Tapas & Martini Bar - I have mixed reviews on this. Scott was attentive and was good with all the clients. There seems to be a mix of regulars here which is nice. They come in for dinner and drinks from their boats. My one complaint which is HUGE is the food. Scott recommended the beef skewers, which I was not in the mood for. His second recommendation was the scallops. I should have known better not to order a scallop tapa from a hotel bar - dumb on me. The scallops were good size, 3 on the plate with I believe walnuts and currants on the bottom, a ton of them. It was super sweet, totally gross and the scallops were rubber. I took one bite, disgusting. But, I took a sip of wine and tried another small bite - even more disgusting. The scallops sat in front of me for an hour until I paid the check. Really? I put my napking over them and my fork and knife, isn't this a subtle enough hint to take them from me and maybe ask me if I want something else? Guess not. My son was having such a good time with one of his new friends I asked them if they would like dessert. They both ordered the apple tart and Hagan Daaz icecream. They were like $11 or $12 each. I'm find with that, but neither of them had more than a bite of the tart and said it was too much crust. I tasted it, yep, not awful, but definitely not worth the money. I didn't complain about that either. As long as my son is happy, I am happy! Here is the funny thing though - when I said it was time to go, neither the new friend or the friends dad thanked either Alec or I for the dessert or said goodbye.....really? Here is why I probably wouldn't stay at the hotel again, but only because I am addicted to my computer and the internet. No wi-fi in the rooms and you have to pay $11.95 to be tethered to the desk to get internet there. The positive is it is absolutely free downstairs and it is very good and a wonderful seating area that even provides computers. If you are on vacation here, this should not be a drawback.

We booked this hotel way in advance because we were in San Diego for a conference. The only reason why we booked at this hotel was because the conference was being held in it. When we went to check in, they told us that we were staying at their sister hotel which was \u00c2\u00bc of a mile away and require shuttle transportation. I figured we had just gone to the wrong place, and that the conference was being held at the sister hotel that they were sending us to, but I soon found out I was wrong. We spent one night at the sister hotel, and we were horrified at the physical condition of the room. The next day we were moved to the bigger hotel where the conference was being held, and had the displeasure of experiencing their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153customer service\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We called asking for hangers because we were staying there for 6 nights. They gave us an attitude and then took over an hour to get the hangers to us. The food was overpriced, which is to be expected at a hotel, but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to charge me double, at least make sure the food is worth it. It was not. My chicken was cold, hard, and dry, and my friend was given a cheeseburger with no bun (and no she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not on the Atkin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s diet). The Restaurant Serves were rude and one even rolled his eyes when we asked him for napkins. Guests would leave their trays in the hallway after they were done with their food and drinks, and they would be left out there for days; room service did not walk the halls. The two glasses that we took a picture of were there for 4 days!!!! In fact, my husband repeatedly put them in the middle of the hallway so that someone would pick them up, and instead they were moved back up against the wall instead of being taken in to be cleaned. When we dialed 0 for the operator, the phone would ring and ring, but no one bothered to answer it. The charge for parking was ridiculous ($22), as was the internet ($17). As soon as we walked in, we were greeted with a commercial boasting that Sheraton spent $6 billion to renovate their hotels across the country, and I guess we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying for it. I think if they could charge us for the air we breathed, they would have. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m really wondering where this money went to. Our experience was unacceptable. We were so shocked that we took a photo log. This is not a cheap motel, but a resort. I was disappointed and disgusted. We paid a lot of money to go to this conference, and spent a few extra days there as a mini vacation. This is definitely not what I had in mind. You can take a look at the pictures, but here are some of the highlights: 1) The wallpaper was stained and falling apart. In one spot, there was blood on the wall. 2) The showerhead was coming off the wall, falling apart, and water was dripping. 3) The bathroom was not clean. 4) The lampshade was stained and had a hair from a previous guest still on it. 5) The electrical outlets were loose, old, broken, and corroded. 6) The AC would turn off all by itself, minutes after we turned it on. There was no way for us to tweak it and let the room cool down to what we were comfortable with. 7) The patio outside was disgusting and had not been cleaned. 8) The telephone did not work. 9) There were cups of coffee, but no coffee maker in the room - cofemaker was very dirty. 10) The baseboards were completely banged up. 11) The sprinklers on the ceiling were rusted, as were the AC vents. 12) The pool area was not cleaned at night, so we could see trash and the towels all over the pool area. 13) There was dust everywhere, especially built up in the vents. 14) The layout of the room was difficult. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not dumb people and we work in real estate. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure out where to turn on the lights. The towels were under the sink and completely unreachable.

The hotel is acutally two Sheraton hotels - the Marina Tower and the Bay Tower, which are about a 5 minute walk apart from each other. I was in the Bay Tower...which is a 3 star hotel that's trying really hard to be a 4 star. And it looks like it's trying. The hotel overall is decent - the rooms were lacking in my opinion. Nothing was by any means impressive. I think the Marina tower must be a lot nicer - at least the lobby and amenities make it appear that way. I can't say that I was ever in a Marina tower room, I can only assume that they're nicer than those in the Bay Tower. The rooms were loud, I could hear doors slamming and toilets flushing at all hours. I'm a light sleeper so this was especially irritating. The rooms had that moist, Mexico feel to them...always just a little bit damp. That has a lot to do with being right on the marina, but when I first checked in, the AC was completely off. That doesn't help either. Overall, the room was very clean, housekeeping came everyday. Staff was friendly, which always goes a long way in my opinion. Only two elevators, which are slow. I ended up just taking the stairs most of the time. Meeting space is nice, lots of rooms/ballrooms between the two towers. Parking is not free and neither is internet access. If you drive, keep your room key handy in the car. You'll need it to enter AND exit the parking lots. (I chunked it into my purse on multiple occasions and had to dig for it while cars lined up behind me. Sorry cars.) I think parking was $11/day and internet was $12/day. It added up though. Also, when you get there, the first hotel you'll see is the Marina tower. You won't see the Bay Tower. So, valet the car or just leave it running at the valet station - do NOT park - go in and check in. There's a chance you're in the other tower and lugging stuff back and forth is annoying. For the nightly rate, I think it could be nicer. The views are good - either of the marina or the bay. It's definitely in a GREAT location relative to the airport; only a couple of miles away. I'd say good location overall actually, it's within about 5 miles of everything: Fashion Valley, the Gaslamp District, Little Italy, etc. Also, great running trails just outside the hotel...run along the marina, watch the boats, it's pretty key for runners.

My room looked down on the Marina (lots of sail boats) and also had a view of the adjacent airport. I spent a lot of time on the balcony watching the marina and airport activity.

My major complaint was about the shuttle service. It's a nightmare! either there's not enough drivers or vehicles, I don't know what but it look a long time for a vehicle to turn up at the airport. There were quite a few waiting as well as Airline Crew and then getting a shuttle back again took a while because they had to locate it then send it to the building you were in!! It didn't drive round all the time like it should! The frustrating thing is, it's across the road from the airport and it is walkable but with luggage, maybe not!! If you don't have your own transport it's a bit restricting. If you opt for the Old Town Trolley Tour, once a day, it will pick up outside the Marina building, ask the Concierge!

This is totally unacceptable, given the fact that we were checking in 12 midnight, which gives them 12 hours of room cleaning time and the hotel is only 12 floors tall. Afterwards Juan's manager gave us this room on the first floor, which was really the basement because the lobby is on the second floor. Our room had traces of insects, because the first thing i found was a dead bug on my pillow. Although the room looked clean, you never know what is on the carpet.

I stayed with my wife and yo ungest daughter while my oldest daughter and her husband joined two days later. Because this happens to be a very busy time of year for the hotel and it was a very special occasion for me, I wrote an email to the General Manager of the Hotel asking if they could assist me in some special requests. Please bear in mind that I do not hold special status at Sheraton so it wouldn't warrant special service ordinarily. Much to my amazement and pleasure, I receiived an immediate response from Scott Hermes, the General Manager (who was also off that day) and also his Executive Assistant Helga Crum that they would work to try to accommodate my requests. They provided me with significantly more than I could have asked or even expected! A large room with a view together with a location within the complex that I had asked for and to top it off, they sent a note with a gift of wine, cheeses and fruits to welcome me to their hotel! They contacted me virtually every day via phone to see if I had everything I needed and offered even more assistance. This all came from the senior management of the hotel! And, just so you know it wasn't just the management that provides this service, the room service meals and personnel were equally pleasant, the food was great, and the smiles abounded. In addition, the maid service was timely and exceptional. When we needed extra towels and hangers, we received those with the same smile and immediacy of time. The front desk was more than courteous and helpful regardless of which one helped you and the valet parking made an effort to know who I was and which car was mine. Many times they welcomed me back by name. An exceptional hotel with very exceptional personnel. This is obviously a top down personification. If the management is first class, the people will be as well. This made a first class room that much better than any of their competition. As a senior executive, I travel extensively worldwide and have well in excess of 2,000 room nights over the past 10-12 years (yes, you read that correctly) and even with status at other properties, I have NEVER experienced the service, hospitality and genuine customer care that I experienced at this hotel! I can tell you that not only will I ONLY seek out this hotel every visit I have to San Diego, but because of this team, I have become a Sheraton Evangelist all over! I can't thank Helga enough, nor Scott enough! They are by far the best I have ever seen!

First she treated me like I was lying (forward me your confirmation!), then she tried to explain that it was just the taxes etc... When I interupted her to explain it was not the taxes she became enraged that I called her lady and not by her name, sorry I forgot.

Unreliable taxi service from hotels further afar in the past made this hotel an easy choice, its shuttle begins operating at 4:45a.m. We booked a standard room in the Harbor tower and were in no time checked in by friendly staff, upgraded to a 10th floor room with balcony and a beautiful view of the comings and goings in San Diego Harbor. The room was very large, well appointed, brightly lit, spotless, including the carpet which appeared new. A super large king bed with soft sheets and good pillows made for a good night of sleep. Airport noise was not audible at all, but walls do not completely muffle very noisy Vacu-flush toilets in adjacent rooms. A 48\" flat screen TV, safe, stocked mini-bar, and a coffee maker with Starbucks coffee packets, desk and a comfortable seating group rounded out the amenities. Not quite up to par was the on-site restaurant which is really a dimly lit bar with tiny round tables, more suited to have a drink than to have dinner (the actual restaurant area is roped off and set aside for breakfast use only). Wanting to have dinner we chose from the limited menu a light meal which was tasty and met our needs. Danny who wears the hats of bartender, waiter, busboy and does everything but prepare the food he serves with a smile as well. Only one other person ate in the restaurant, which may be an indication that other nearby establishments on Harbor Island are a better dining choice.

The hotel is basically across from the airport. We heard planes now and then, but it was not disruptive at all. Check-in was very efficient, and extremely friendly (thank-you Dinah!). Arriving in the morning, we expected to check our bags, and get our room later in the day, but we got our room right away. We were offered our choice of the two buildings, and picked the main one, knowing the rooms were smaller but it had more restaurants etc. We were asked for our view preference, and chose the marina view (gorgeous). The room was a decent size, very nicely furnished and clean. The beds were extremely comfortable, and had beautiful linens. We opted for the 'green' choice and didn't have daily housekeeping but towels were replaced upon request. This gave us a daily $5 voucher towards food/beverages, which we used for our morning coffee at Starbucks (located in the lobby). Our package also included breakfast, which is pricey in my opinion. If we had paid off the menu for our breakfast, including a fruit bowl (delicious), juice, coffee and main item, the price per person would have been at least $30. Without having a car, we had breakfast every day at the hotel (food and service were both excellent). Be prepared to drive or take cabs to get around, as there is very little in the immediate area within walking distance. We weighed the option of renting a car vs paying cab fare to get around. Daily parking at the hotel is $22. Added to the cost of car rental, and not being familiar with the area, we decided to travel by cab. Allow (pre-tip, round trip) approx. $30 to/from Old Town, $56 to/from Coronado (hotel Del Coronado), $25 to/from downtown/Gaslamp Quarter. With only 4 days, and much on our agenda, we didn't have a chance to spend time at the pool or use any of the other amenities. Quinn's sports bar was a nice place to end our day (kids are allowed, even though it's called a bar). There is a free computer area for web-surfing, email etc., and for printing boarding passes (note - in-room internet is $11.95/day). Since our room was included with our airline package, it's difficult to rank the value, but while we were there, the 'walk-in' rate was $199/night. We did not use the mini-bar or room service.

There are two restaurants and two different bars, and a full service Starbucks. Although the prices for food in the bar were high, I think they are on par with most 4 star hotels. While the menu had some high priced items, there were many items in the $12-16 range. Although parking is $22, this is the same if not less than what many 3 star hotels charge downtown. I have paid as much as $36. Since there are dozens of hotel choices in the downtown area, this hotel only makes sense for me if I don't need to get around the city.

At $22 a day, which again we realize parking is always going to be high and we spent $22 at the next hotel we stayed at on this vacation, although that was for valet parking. The lot that you park in is a dirt lot that is easily 1/2 mile from your room while they are allowing non-guests to also park in the lot for a fee which makes it even more difficult to find a spot.

Our room was nice - we had a view of the water (the Marina and the pool).

In the evenings, Quinn's and Tapatini were quite popular places to be. I really liked the atmosphere. It was a great way to relax and meet new people! The area around the hotel does not have much. There are 2 other restaurants that are able half a mile, and a mile away from the hotel. Island Prime and Tom Ham's Lighthouse were both worth walking to. We ended up taking a taxi home because we were too full to walk. We used taxi's to get everywhere because we did not want to worry about trying to use the buses. Taxi's are a bit more expensive than the buses and trolleys, but it saves you tons of time and hassle! The free shuttle to and from the airport was very nice. I loved the view from the hotel. Being right on the ocean and in the marina was beautiful. The paths to walk along the ocean were very nice. I would suggest requesting the Marina Tower, as it is the part that has all of the amentities. The Bay Tower is a little ways away from the main tower and does not have any amentities.

We stayed on the eight floor, which had a great view of San Diego Bay. Our stay included the weekend, so we had a great view of the boats traversing by. One factor to consider is that the Bay Tower is approximately a quarter mile from the main facility at the Marina Tower and Lanai areas. I didn't really spend time at the other areas, but I heard that the amenities (business area, resturant and pool) may be a little nicer there. We wanted the bigger room and the view. We did have breakfast at the restaurant at the Bay Tower. It is buffet-style with the basic bacon/sausage, eggs/omlette, potatoes. There are also breakfast pastries, oatmeal, cold cereal and fruit. It is nice, The cost is what you would expect from a place higher-end hotel like the Sheraton. The pool area at the Bay Tower is a little small. There is also a hot tub. If the pool area is of particular interest for your family, I'd suggest staying at the Marina Tower and/or Lanai. Because of the weather, we didn't use the pool. Location is a bit remote. Hotel is right across the entrance to San Diego Airport. I could see how it would be convenient for a business meeting with people flying in from across the country. However, it is 10-15 minutes away from Horton Plaza/Downtown/Gaslamp District. It is about the same distance to Balboa Park and and the San Diego Zoo. As such, you will need vehicle transportation to enjoy the sights and sounds of the city (and pay for parking at most places along the way). Self-parking was $22/night. You use your room key to get in and out (so make sure you have it). It is commeasurate with the downtown hotels. I'm note sure why it is so expensive, but make sure that you factor that into your plans. The Wall Street Journal and USA Today were available in the lobby.

This hotel has been in SD for a while and we were a little apprehensive. We heard about the renovation and it was fantastic!!! First and foremost - the option to decline housekeeping for a $5.00 voucher that can be used at the hotel (yes, Starbucks too) is BRILLIANT! Why can't every hotel do this!!! We always decline housekeeping and tidy our own room, hang towels for reuse, make our own bed, which saves the hotel $$$$ with no incentive, this place gets it! They will give you clean towels by the way, and you still get the $ 5.00 voucher! Another thing, the elevators are ample, large and fast, the elevator lobby on each floor is huge, bright, scenic and impressive, again as compared to gaslamp hotels, which seem to skimp on elevators if you ask me. The only drawback is distance from gaslamp, but this hotel made up for it. When we checked in the kind clerk said we had an economy room booked, but she promptly said she'd put us in a better room on the 6th floor, and we got a king as we had hoped for. The room is very spacious, with a downtown view, balcony, great bed and linens. Small bathroom, but well done - subway tile in shower, tub, lots of spots to hold soap, shampoo, etc., rain shower head, marble vanity with very nice lighting. Flat screen TV, high ceilings, very nice. Super, super quiet, even with airport across the street! The pool set it apart from other gaslamp hotels. It was really awesome. Overlooking the marina, tons of space, lots of lounge chairs, big pool, sunny, cabana bar, really great for downtown SD. The hotel lobby is great, computer kiosks with internet, cozy, modern. Starbucks in lobby is great. Parking at $ 22.00 for self park in lot that is part dirt is ridiculous. If you self park, be sure to bring room key to let yourself out of unattended parking lot! We had to re-park, go to lobby, get another key, just to exit the parking lot! A drag. We loved this hotel.

I got a good rate for the hotel for under $100 a night at Priceline so I thought. First of all from the reviews I expected the Marina Tower to be a better fit so asked for an upgrade and got one from the desk agent at an unexpected extra $20 a night. Now the Marina tower is nice because it has a restaraunt, bar, starbucks and heated pool along with full service gym. However if you want a bigger room and in my opinion better views stay at the Bay tower. They have a basic lobby but if you don't need all the ammenities I previously mentioned then that place is probably the better location. The bay tower is serviced by a free shuttle. I would stay at the bay tower next time. As far as transportation service. My daughter and I relied on public transportation. The shuttle takes you to the airport where you catch the bus. Since we relied on public transportation this place was not convenient. If you plan to travel the same way choose a place closer to the hub of transportation (downtown). I rented a car the last day and found free parking on the pennisula. This is closer to the bay tower and is a cheap way to park your car. Be advised there are only about 15 free parking spaces that are 3 hour time limit but free all night after 11. All and all the hotel is nice but I wouldn't stay here if you plan on exploring San Diego. We had a \"Go Card\" so that is what we did. I would like to thank \"Angelique\" at the front desk for her professional and kind service in dealing with the charges for my room. Noise is not an issue.

The location was a bit of an issue at first because we thought it was going to be downtown, so it was further away than we thought. We fell in love with the view from our room and the girls at the concierge helped us rent a car so we could get around the city better. The beds were comfortable and our room was always spotless when we returned from sight seeing. It was also nice that there was a Starbucks in the hotel. Our only issues with this hotel was the overpriced, poor quality breakfast buffet and the unhelpful, rude hotel manager we had a run-in with. I have been all over the world and stayed in a variety of hotels, the breakfast buffet at the Sheraton wasn't even comparable to a continental breakfast at a Holiday Inn. Poorly cooked eggs and rotten fruit cost us $19 each! The other issue with the manager happened on friday night (April 8th). We were looking for parking and could not find any on one side of the hotel and the other side was blocked. We were exhausted and just wanted to get to our room. We asked a valet what the problem was and we were informed that there was a large wedding the next day that required the whole other side of the parking lot. We asked if we could valet for the same price as regular parking (Reg is $22 and Valet is $28), he said he would have to ask the manager. We pulled over and waited for a decision. The manager on duty came to our car and rudely informed us again of the wedding and that he would not valet our car for anything less than $28. We asked what we were supposed to do and he condescendingly told us we would have to park in employee parking that was very far away from the hotel and unpaved (it was raining so it was a big muddy mess). My boyfriend expressed that this was unacceptable and as guests we should have parking close the hotel. The manager then yelled at him that we would have to park there or not at all and there was nothing else he could do for us and walked away without another word. Like I said I travel quite frequently and have stayed in 5 star hotels and no-star hotels and I have never had some speak to me the way that manager did (I wish I could remember his name). Sheraton should take more care in training their entire staff to meet the needs of their guests, especially their managers.

I would not rate it a business hotel, more of a family hotel you would expect to find next to Disneyland. If you have a family attending Sea World or local attractions, I recommend this hotel. It is also extremely convenient to the airport. We had issues with check-in, waiting over 2 hours in the lobby. In the hotel's defense we arrived at 1PM, so we were early. However, the desk staff said the room was available, just not cleaned. They would \"call housekeeping to have it prioritized\" and it would be ready within an hour. Later another person at the desk laughed and said that was crazy, Housekeeping doesn't do that. After over 2 hours, they gave me a room that was already cleaned. The biggest negative was the Club Lounge, which we paid extra to have access to. Our card key did not work, so we had to go to the desk to have it fixed (again). At breakfast it was an interstate exit Hampton Inn with at least 12-15 little kids (ages 8 and under). Wow...wiping noses and then pawing through the pastries, eating from the line, taking stacks of things...real disgusting mess. We also had an issue getting to the Lounge and central elevator because of a \"closed for contrsuction\" hallway, which the desk told me was incorrect, \"you just must be going the wrong way\".

I paid almost $300/night to stay here and it is only worth $90. This hotel is directly across from the airport, meaning that you are kept up all night and early morning by the booming of planes taking off and landing. I reserved a high rise water view with a king bed. While I did receive a high level room with a view of the water, the water was across 2 parking lots and a street, and again right next to the airport. Not a relaxing view. On top of that I got 2 small double beds instead of a king that would in no way fit 2 adults. When I asked at check-in I was told that even though I had reserved my room 3 months before, they overbooked and were out of the rooms I had reserved. They did not offer many any compensation. There is no wireless in the rooms, and if you would like to use the plug in it is $13 day. Since it is across from the airport it is also near absolutely nothing, so unless you want to eat overpriced mediocre food at the hotel restaurant you will need to pay an expensive roundtrip cab to for all your meals or activities. I also tried asking the concierge about getting to downtown and what to do and was met with a snide comment about taxis being outside. The positives were that the rooms were kept clean, the bed was comfortable (if only one person slept in each bed), they had a good hair dryer, and their was a complimentary van to the airport (although not to downtown which would have been highly desirable). Overall I would NEVER stay at this hotel again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

He said that he would Fed-X them to me the next day (Saturday the 5th) But then he realized that FedX does not ship on the weekends, he called me back immediately and said they wouldn't go out until Monday.

We went to check in and it was clear that the Front Desk could care less about her job and she handed us a key packet. We then soon find out that pricing is $22 dollars PER DAY for parking in their lot (and that is \"self park\"). Then, we realized that there are two 'towers' and the front desk associate never told us where we were suppose to park, which tower the room was in or how to get there. We finally found the room, got settled in, and pulled out the laptop to look up ideas for places to go, only to find out that it costs 12.95 PER DAY to use the internet in your room. Seriously, what hotel does not have complimentary internet?! Hole in the wall hotels even do!!! On the morning of check-out we got a bill under our door. The bill showed a $16 charge for \"Other Hotel Charges\". I called down to the desk and explained to the front desk lady that we paid for this room on Priceline so we should not have any charges on the room. She precedes to say that even though we paid for the room and tax through Priceline, we still had to pay some tax to them as well. I was a hotel manager so I know this was bull, but just to make sure that it wasn't some weird CA tax, I called the Holiday Inn down the street from the Sheraton and asked if there would be any additional tax charges if I booked my room online, which they obviously said NO. So, I went down to the desk and spoke to a different person and explained that we should not have any room/tax charges because we booked it through Priceline. She took the receipt, did some stuff on her computer, and handed us a new receipt with the charges taken off...without saying what those charges were actually for. The only think I could think of is that they try to stick you will just another hidden fee and try to pass it off as \"tax\". And, guess what? It doesn't end there..... We get home and look at our bank statement and it shows that 16 dollar fee CHARGED!! We were furious. We called the front desk and they transferred us to the accounting department. The accounting department said that they would send us a new receipt showing the \"breakdown\" of why we were charged, but that there were 3 people ahead of us so the email probably wouldn't go out until the next day!

Not my kind of hotel, but acceptable when there's no better choice. I stayed here because everything else was booked because of 2 conventions in town. But my biggest beef is the deceitful \"bait & switch\" I was subjected to! After checking into the main lobby, I was told my room was in the Bay Tower just 5 minutes' walk away. There was a pretty map of the \"property\" showing the two towers and the surrounding pools, so I got the impression maybe it's just one of those large resort-like properties. Well, it turns out that this is literally down the road, several commercial property blocks away, in what is a second-rate motel that was probably a Ramada Inn-level place that they bought and are selling as part of the Sheraton. The gym and pool is a joke, the lobby is not a place you can comfortably hang out in, there is no coffee kiosk or Wireless Lounge like in the main building\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut you pay the same price. The so-called view is over a parking lot towards the harbor\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfacing the naval base with turbine engines that go on till late at night. The one good thing if you have an early flight out is that it is literally next to the airport. If I had to stay here again, here's what I'd do next time: 1) Make sure my room is in the main \"Marina Tower\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot the second-rate \"Bay Tower.\" This matters to me because I like easy access to a coffeeshop downstairs, and a better gym and pool and hangout areas. Not that it's not a good place\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut I'd rather stay at a Double Tree then, and pay accordingly and at least have warm cookie instead of those sensor refrigerators you're warned not to use or touch. 2) If I get stuck in the Bay Tower again, personally, I'd prefer the room to face the Marina instead of the harbor.

Sadly enough I know Sheraton for the better, but this stay was a major let down! Horrible experience! We made a mistake by booking this hotel based on the Excellent reviews and we never dreamed of that we would have to agree with lots of people who rated this particular hotel as Poor or even worse Terrible. Our check-in was awful, the receptionist wasn't interested in us at all, and although they have plenty of rooms available on both sides of the hotel (the main big building!) the receptionist didn't even bother to ask us which side we would like to have, ie. Marina view or the absolutely fantastic views of the city, which we didn't get. The Concierge staff were most of the time playing with their mobile phones while we were there, only when you let them know by calling them they would respond to you and then they will acknowledge you. The soap and shampoo were unreplenished and heavily underestimated, and we were left the dirty glasses in our room for days! We have to contact them several times for the soap and shampoo and it arrived there several hours later! When you go half way around to World on a holiday of a lifetime the last thing you need is to be annoyed and frustrated with the basic, small things issues and problems which shouldn't have happened in normal circumstances and with professional members of staff. Some of the staff appeared to us as either new and unsufficiently trained, or just not happy with their job or whatever else is in the background. The room service was slow, and once they appeared they were even slower as they had a new guy in the room service departpment who was to receive his training - in front of us in the evening! This was a horrible experience as we have just landed after a very long flight! Unfortunately the senior member of the room service failed to spot this and unfortunatelly we were left with no other option than to participate in that Circus de la Room Service! Once we finished our meal we called the room service to pick up their trolley, they just told us to drive the trolley out and leave it there, which stayed there for the whole night. They first picked up the trolley in the morning in front of our door. However, once they've picked up the trolley, another room service attendant hours later came to our door banging and asking us for the trolley from a previous night, to our great astonishment! We've told him that the trolley had been picked up by someone else. He was very grumpy in his search for that trolley and he didn't even apologise to us for the disturbance he made. He walked away muttering something to himself. Shocking experience! Chocolate from the mini-bar incident: Wow! This episode is a top notch of BAD Customer Services!! Honestly! WOW! On our 1st night we took a chocolate from our room's mini-bar, and to our great astonishment, the chocolate had expired MONTHS ago! Clearly we were not happy with it, and on our discovery some other products had been expired too! As the mini-bar in the rooms is touch-sensitive, we had try to communicate this to the room service and the front desk, but without any success! So, a trip to the reception in a middle of a night was needed to try and get another chocolate from either them or room service or something like that. The night receptionist failed to understand what the problem was, she wasn't interested in our problem what so ever!! We have explained to her that we don't want to be charged for it so if she can make sure of that, and if we can get someone to replenish other products from the mini-bar asap. Our request fall on death ears, the girl just didn't have a clue what I was on about, and she kept asking me to comeback tomorrow to the reception or to get hold of someone in the room service, but first the following day?!?! She had a proper attitude, so it was best to leave the argument there. Oh my God, the following day our HORRIBLE customer experience continiued!!! WOW!! Someone from the housekeeping came banging at our door, and we have asked her to comeback later as it was very early and it was a proper inconvenience. She spoke very limited English so clearly she did NOT understand what we were telling her. As soon as we realized that the lingustics are the issue we have tried to simplyfy our message to her. Then she walked away. Not even half an hour later she came around again, the same housekeeper, claiming that the room service send her. We didn't want her in the room at that time as we were still asleep but we felt that we didn't have a choice as she muttered something to us that she is busy! WOW! Like we care?? What a stressful event. And yet it did not end here. We have struggled to understand to communicate to her what the problem was about the mini-bar as it is was very obvious to us that the night receptionist did not tell her the whole story! Shocking. So, we have spent good 15 minutes explaining to this lady that we didn't touch or eat or drunk ANYTHING from the mini-bar, she claimed that we did as it was missing, and then we told her that she must seek that missing chocolate bar from the reception!! She was very suspicious, and she muttered something to herself, something which we didn't understand, in Spanish! She was visibly upset about the whole thing although we have tried to explain to her in a very plain language so she did understand what we were telling her. Then all of sudden she started to complain to us that she doesn't understand English very well, and that she will send someone else. We felt sorry for this woman in a way, but we were upset at the same time about how this could have happened, this great misscommunication between the departments. This housekeeper sent from the room service wanted to charge us for the expired chocolate from the mini-bar. No one ever came later on to replenish other expired products from the mini-bar and we have never ever touched that mini-bar again. We never received a call or any message of acknowledgment from anyone from anywhere from the hotel, so we were left in uncertainty about the whole mini-bar experience until we have received our final invoice where we have registered that they did not charge us for the mini-bar products. Awful experiences, constant frustrations, desperation, bad customer services and what else not!! Soon after this room service left our room we were to go to bed again, however that wasn't possible as another housekeeper kept knocking at our door to clean the room although we did have a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door!!!! She came around twice and she realized we were not up then she said she will come back later. She too muttered something to herself and appeared not to be happy because of our presence in the room. The same incident happened the following day too. Awful! On a check out from this hotel the lack of same interest for the paying and valuable guests like us was the same as we entered the hotel, awful, nothing, appaling! Even when we stayed at the 2 or 3 stars places the members of staff were very warm, hospitable, very friendly and kind to us. The room we had didn't have the city view and that was a major let down, although we must emphasize that the rooms are lovely (in the main building!). I can follow to some extent what other critics wrote about the design and furniture of this hotel, however, our main objective and at the same time a total FAILURE of those were lack of friendly and welcoming stuff, appaling customer services and never going and extra mile for a customer!! A major disappointment, frustration, desperation and what else not! We made a major mistake by booking this hotel! The room and the building is nice, they even have Starbucks there which I was quite pleased about it, the area, the lobby is okay and the views around the hotel are nice, but what's the point when you have your holiday and mood ruined by rude members of staff with a proper attitude and no clue what so ever??!! It is a real shame as our money will now go to someone else instead of Sheraton in San Diego! If they don't appreciate your business, well, there are plenty of other competitors who will do anything for you and your valuable revenue!! You don't travel half away around the World on a holiday of a lifetime to get crappy and appaling customer services and attitude, that's just plain WRONG!! :(( And if you're lucky you'll get one of those PR-letters from the Management saying how surprised and sorry they are about your experience and how they hotel pride itself to be the best and blah blah blah, and they will just wish you all the best! What a joke! We won't stay there ever again until the things change DRAMATICALLY for the better, obviously!! Sheraton other places maybe, but this one, no way!

Yes, the hotel is not in the downtown area. But, there are two buses that stop a five minute walk away that go directly to downtown. As well, there is a nice walking path (that is safe) that is about 4 km to the heart of the city. I only took one cab the entire visit. There are lovely running trails right out of the hotel.The gym was fantastic as well. The staff at the front desk were very helpful and polite. I also found the service in the bar area to be superb. Room service was expensive, but that is to be expected. The room was spacious and clean, although I could not be given a king bed because I had made the booking on priceline. I would advise anyone who is a light sleeper to choose to stay on the marina side. The side that overlooks the city is closest to the airport and was quite noisy on my first night. But, the front desk let me change rooms after the fist sleepless night. There were some cons to this place. The hotel is promoting this \"green\" concept that is supposed help the environment with reducing waste with washing of linens. If you sign up for this program, you get a five dollar voucher to use at the hotel in return for not getting your sheets and towels washed. I felt this program was pushed on me and I felt bad declining it. What they do not mention is that \"going green\" means that housekeeping doesn't even enter your room for your stay. My garbage was loading up and I put them outside of my room to get emptied, only for them to completely disappear. As well, there are complimentary teas in the room that would normally be topped up if housekeeping was in daily. Because they weren't, I had to get my own tea from Starbucks which was how I ended up spending my five dollar voucher. I'm all for going green, but I believe this is just a ploy for the hotel to save money on staff and cleaning rather than saving the environment. All I was left with was a dirty room with an unmade bed. I will not be doing this initiative in the future. I will just ask housekeeping not to change the sheets and keep my towels on the racks. My second complaint was when I switched rooms the first night because of the airplane noise, I ended up being in a room that had a door directly connecting my suite to another suite. I could hear practically every breath of the people next door, some of which was quite embarrassing. Make sure you request a room without a door connection in it. It is really kind of archaic and I did not feel safe as I was travelling alone and the door only had a cheap looking lock on it. All in all, I paid 75 dollars a night for the room.

I told her I wanted to stay on the club level. She ended up putting us in the Bay Tower which doesn't offer the club level which was annoying because I paid for this upgrade. I discovered the error the next morning when I called to inquire where the club room was. The person on the phone had to add the club level access to our reservation. He only agreed to do this after I complained about the confusion at check in and the fact that I requested a wake up call but never got one. Overally, I can't complain too much because I got the room for only $79/night (before the extra $20/night for the upgrade). But had I paid more than $100 I would have been mad.

The hotels are connected by a sidewalk that takes an adult walking quickly 6-7 minutes from one location to the other. The Marina appears to be the newer of the two and offers upgraded facilities. The pool, whirlpool and fitness room are far superior to the Bay hotel. This hotel fronts a very upscale marina. pricing for items like food reflect this. Saturday brunch was $19 pp, more in line with upscale hotel pricing but delivering basic offerings. The airport is just across the street, convenient but also noisy from 6am-9pm. The Bay hotel offers larger rooms, but is a more sterile and noisy inside. Make sure to get a room viewing the bay not the airport. Stayed five nights and prefer the marina location.

It is very near the airport with a quick, free shuttle, and very courteous drivers both to and from the airport. I had to FedEx 2 important packages of conference materials to the hotel in advance. I was initially told that the package room closed at 4:30 PM, and since I was not arriving until late in the evening before the conference, I was worried about not being able to pick up the packages. I called ahead to make sure they would be available and Guest Services and the bellmen had everything waiting when I arrived. The hotel is located away from the main tourist areas and most restaurants, so you need a rental car or taxi (always available) to go most places. I tend to like the locations near the downtown or Convention Center, so there are places to walk to after my meetings. Lots of scenic places for jogging or walking near the water, though. There are 3 different locations for rooms within the same hotel property. The main tower attached to the lobby, the Bay Tower which is reached by a shuttle or a considerable walk, or the Lanai which is somewhat attached to the main hotel, but still a considerable walk. My room was in the Lanai and I was given a complex map to find it. I was offered the services of a bellman to help with my luggage, but had no idea how complicated it would be to find the room Not only that, but when I did find the Lanai, it was raining (unusual for San Diego) and all the rooms opened directly to the outside, the only elevator was miles away, and I trudged up the steps with all my luggage.to the top floor which was completely open to the rain. Every time I had to go to the Starbucks, restaurant, or free internet in the lobby, I was right out in the rain which lasted for 3 days. The room itself was fine, but I have no idea what the Tower rooms were like, very clean with comfortable beds and big desk. The TV had the 3 major networks and a few cable stations (limited). The view of the marina was beautiful. There was a very loud air conditioner in the wall of the room which you could turn either on or off, but not set a temp. so that it would go on or off. When you turn on the bathroom light, a loud fan automatically went on. So, all in all, it was loud. They have a rainfall shower, which some people like, and had a little bit harder setting, but it took forever to rinse out shampoo. Nonetheless, the hotel was very nice. Everyone was extremely courteous, and except for the check-in person who could have assigned a better location, very helpful with any request. I wound up ordering salads or sandwiches to take up to my room for several meals at Quinn's which is the bar and has a great menu. Their marinated skirt steak is delicious. I think the food all comes from a central kitchen, but did not try their main restaurant. The Starbuck's in the lobby is good, opens about 5:30 AM (I think) but closes at about 5:30 PM. The gift shop stays open until 11:00 PM, so no problem there. The Fitness Center is open with a key 24 hours and very well stocked with equipment.

The morning of our checkout I was packing the suitcases for our flight and noticed that our big shopping bag of clothes and souvenirs was missing. Nothing else was touched in the room and I quickly deduced that housekeeping could have picked it up thinking it was garbage. I immediately called the front desk in horror thinking it had gone to the dumpster and perhaps they could retrieve it before the inevitable. The front desk person was very defensive of the housekeeping staff and told me in a surly tone that this was a matter of security and that I shouldn't assume anything. Security came to the door and took all of our information citing they would begin an investigation and that they needed to review all the risk management strategies or something to that effect. I told them what I thought about it being a possible mistake by housekeeping given he fact that there was also packaging material from my now sobbing 8 year old son's souvenirs in the bag as well. I asked them to please go and check the garbage, but the gentleman just pursed his lips and gave me a blank expression that I could only deduce was that it \"ain't gonna happen.\" They left the room and promised to call us and give us an update on the following Monday. After my phone calls (that magically go to voicemail) and email, it has been a month and there has been absolutely no response or contact. I am extremely disappointed with this lack of response.

The hotel is conveniently located near the airport, and pretty close to downtown (about a $12.00 cab fare), yet the setting by the marina and bay give one the feeling of being in a private oasis. I had a sixth floor room with a view of the harbor (and airport) and despite the fact I could see planes taking off, it felt very peaceful. Saturday night I was even able to watch the fireworks at Seaworld from my (nice sized) balcony! The room itself was spacious, comfortable and very clean. The only negative remark I could make is that the size of the bathroom was a little small, not that of a four star hotel. Both mornings I used room service for breakfast and the meals were great, delivered timely and fresh. Coffee in the room is Starbucks and delicous and super easy to make. Directly across the street from the hotel is a walking path along the bay. It's lovely and is a great place to unwind and watch the boats and take in a terrific view of the San Diego skyline.

Seriously, sitting outside on the balcony in the morning and drinking my coffee was a nice start to the day. We did not interact with the staff much other than to call them to get the times of the shuttle which they were always happy to give. This brings me to the transportation part of the review. Parking fees were 22 bucks a day! But this is easily discernible well in advance and anyone with a modicum of sense would do their research before going. We did a decent workaround - rented from hertz every day in the morning and returned in the evening. It cost us $10 more every day because of the $10 fee per rental but you are saving about $12 a day for the parking so in total a win.

I asked the waitress if she could please have a table bussed so that my family could sit down. She said it would be several minutes and if I wanted to wait I could but did not know when it would be done. Since it was my first time in the restaurant and first time in the hotel I asked how I go about to reserve the table (put my name in the front, with her, etc.) and she said to stand by the table until she had the time to clear it off. The table by the way was a complete mess, not so much with the dishes from the previous guest, but with her towels, serving tray, and cleaner. She bussed the table and my family and I sat down. After we sat down a booth became available and my wife asked if I could get it for us since our 2 year old would be easier if he was between the two of us inside a booth. The waitress quickly came over to me and told me that table was reserved for another guest that had been waiting. As I was confused because she had told me that for me and my family to get a table we would have to stand by it, I asked her why she would hold another table for a guest and make me stand by a table. The other guest came to the table that had been told by the waitress that she would hold it and created a very uncomfortable situation for them and I. I went back to my table to let my wife know the bad news and when the waitress went by, I asked for clarification from the waitress. She said that they had been waiting for the table and I said I understood but why did she make me stand by a table while she took their name, she looked at me, looked at my kids, rolled her eyes, flipped her hair, and walked away. I never received clarification, an apology, or even acknowledgment, and she had someone else wait on us in her station area so she would not have to deal with us. It makes me wonder why a young family would receive different treatment as my money, tips, opinions, and access to the internet to voice it are just as good as anyone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. It took over an hour to get our food while people who came in after us were getting fed. When asked turned out that they were holding the kids food until my ribs were done, Honestly, with two small children starting to loose it from lack of food common sense says bring it out. The food was overpriced and the kids pizza was cold. The hotel charged us for items out of the mini bar fridge automatically because the left over pizza we put in the fridge blocked the sensor for an item. The line to check out was over an hour to clear up the bill. The view was great and if you did not have kids could be a very romantic place to stay, DO NOT STAY HERE WITH KIDS.

Having read all of the negative reviews on here beforehand, I was very disappointed to find out we were booked into the Bay Tower, but thought I would give it a fair chance. The Bay Tower is, at most, a 1/4 mile away from the Marina Tower. Bay Tower has its own separate lobby. For all intensive purposes, they are 2 completely separate hotels that simply share the Sheraton name. For Priceline to allow the Bay Tower to be booked as a 4-star hotel is disappointing and frustrating. I'm sure there are different qualifications for what makes 4-star vs 3-star vs 2-star, etc. But for me, a 4-star hotel should make you think things like, \"This is nice\", or \"This goes above & beyond a normal hotel\", or basically, \"Wow, this is fancy!\" Sheraton Harbor Island Bay Tower sadly did none of those things. The Marina Tower, from what I saw, appeared to be a nice, newer, sleek-looking closer-to-4-star hotel. It's a 5-10 minute walk from the Bay Tower. The Starbucks in the Marina Tower is quite nice, and therefore very busy. If you choose the hotel's Green Option (of declining daily maid service), you will get a $5 coupon under your door each night, which can be used at Starbucks. So that was nice since it pretty much paid for a drink each morning. The living space in the room was average. Since it's literally across the street from the Bay, it had a nice balcony that looked out onto the Bay. The Bay-View has ships & military boats go by, vs. the Marina-View, which just has boats parked there. However, if you pick the Bay-View, there always seemed to be a lot of loading/unloading/work going on in the mornings since the loading docks are on the first floor, directly under the balconies. This causes a lot of noise (ie, not very relaxing), especially if you're on the lower floors Bay-view side. The room's decor itself was ok, nothing fancy at all. The couch looked quite worn. The bed was firm, bordering on hard. Pillows were very thin, even when double folded. The clock radio was cheap, as in $10 Radio Shack cheap. No iPod or auxiliary connection that I would expect a 4-star hotel to have. The bathroom really showed the age of the room. The wallpaper was borderline gross in places and should really be replaced straight away. The shower was weak in terms of pressure - it could not shoot to the back wall. But it did stay hot for a long shower. The towels were your basic white hotel standard-issue ones; i.e., the ones that are barely long enough to wrap around my 36-inch waist. I have nicer towels than this at home! And only one towel hook/hanger in the bathroom. The TV was pathetic. A 4-star hotel should not have an old 27\" old CRT TV. This was the TV my brother had in high-school in the mid-90's. Also, our TV had an annoying habit, when the balcony doors were open, of switching itself back to the Hotel Menu channel randomly every couple minutes. The problem went away when the balcony doors were shut. Very odd. There is a $22 per night parking charge to park in the lot in front of the hotel. I wasn't that upset about the fee since most hotels - and everywhere else - in San Diego charge you for parking if you're anywhere near the water. I think it's fair to say that you really need a car if you're going to stay here for any extended period of time. Taxi charges will add up quickly. Because for the most part, you're really in the middle of nowhere in terms of shopping/places to walk to. There is a Fresh & Easy about 5+ miles away in Point Loma, but alas, there is no refrigerator in the room. On to the positives - the view obviously is great on the Bay side. The gym area downstairs was free to use. Again, dated machines but free is nice and unheard of at most hotels. The employees were all very nice and helpful. There is free wi-fi in the lobby. There is also a \"business center\" with 3 computers and a printer that are free to use. The room itself though feels outdated and not very professional at all for a \"business center\", but again, at least it was free to use. All in all, the Sheraton Bay Tower felt like a hotel from the Hotel Circle that had simply been placed in Harbor Island. It felt much more like a 2- or 3-star hotel. Nothing left me saying \"Wow this is fancy\". Even having paid a discounted rate, I still felt disappointed about the hotel experience.

I wish we could have had more time to enjoy the hotel. My family which consists of my husband, two teenagers and a 10 yr old had a blast during the week of Comic-Con. Check-in was speedy and seamless. Check-out was just as well handled. We had found a discrepency on the bill and the counter check-out staff fixed it right away. We were given a spacious room for the 5 of us but one of the teenagers had to sleep on the floor anyway. The cleaning staff was gracious enough to make sure he had clean linen every day and we had plenty of coffee and towels for all of us. The best thing of all was getting my youngest childs Teddy Bear Back. Apparently the bear had been covered up in the bedding and inadvertently left behind. We didn't notice until we were several hours away. My child was beside himself. He said with huge allegator tears running down his face, \"Mommy I need Henry. He keeps the bads dreams away\". As you can probably guess I felt his absolute vulnerability and terror at that moment in time. The realization that for the first time in 9 yrs he would not have Henry to fall asleep with. I called the hotel and the security staff put housekeeping on the alert right away. We didn't hear anything for a day. I called the next day. Still no Henry but assurances were given that people were looking for the bear and someone would call me as soon as it was found. Day 2 we get a call. Henry had been located. Housekeeping had washed the bear and was waiting for a trip home. The next day the manager FedEx'd the missing companion to Oregon. We received Henry 3 days later. Clean and well travelled, into the very happy waiting arms of his life long companion. My son learned a valuable lession during those \"Henry-less\" days. #1 He could sleep nightmare free without Henry. #2 Never forget to look in the blankets at a hotel before declaring \"I'm all packed lets go\" and #3 It was sure good to get Henry home.

Nobody's gps's worked properly in the area either which we were certain were a result of the naval base. If staying here again, I would highly recommend the Marina Tower over the Bay Tower. Bay's nice but, Marina's where it's all happening. Restaurant prices were horrible forcing most to find food elsewhere........AND, the Bay tower could really use some laundry facilities.....especially if their going to be the host hotel for a baseball tourney. The worst part of the entire trip was the entire reservation process where the resey's were made back in March and apparently this hotel/chain is not set up for this type of venue as our resey's were a complete nightmare from the beginning. The hotel staff once we arrived was very accomodating to insure everything was in order and we got everything fixed. Kudo's to Blair & Brett for all of their help and excellent professionalism however, BP a supervisor back at the main office (you know who you are), NEVER fulfilled his promises nor even replied back to repeated emails asking for help. This after spending a fair amount of time on the phone with him to rectify everything. Give that guy a demerit...........The hotel itself is in a great location with a great view of the harbor. They should really step up to Queen beds (in lieu of doubles) cause you have the room to do so and doubles are rediculous for couples traveling with kids or players. We especially liked the overall locale of the hotel and it's proximity to many of the featured area's: Sea World, Zoo, Old Town, Little Italy, Coronado Island, etc....... And it's a HUGE SECRET that I'll share with you here.......Between the two towers and closest building to the Bay Tower, there's a MARINA DELI on the back side of the building that serves wonderful bfst & lunch for extremely reasonable prices. They also have quite a few ammenities should you need drinks, snacks, beer whateover. Too bad we did not find it till the last day we were there but, a fantastic breakfast was had by almost our entire team and priced as it should be. There's also laundry facilities there but, do not believe they are suppose to be available to anyone aside from the members of the marina........but, it's there and nobody is spose to talk about it.

They did eventually relent after my wife drop by the front desk for the n^th time asking and looking for buckets/bags/trash cans/etc to hold enough ice as an alternative.

Firstly, they have two properties. One is a hotel, which they call the 'Marina Tower' with nice lobby, flat tvs and restaurant, etc and then they have another called 'Bay Tower' which is more like a run down apartment building/crackhouse/dorm that they like to shuttle you to and call it 'an upgrade' and that they 'have bigger rooms' and so on. Liars. It is horrible, run down, CRT TVs and cream whitewashed furniture. The other tower has Flat TVs, lovely showers and you are on the Marina, not overlooking the Airport, which is the Bay Tower view. Add this to the fact that it is $300+ per night, charge $25 per night for self parking your car, $13 per PC for internet per night and this is a $400+ per night stay and honestly, a joke. Even sitting in the restaurant for breakfast and all you see is stains on the windows that block your view of the harbor and make you ask yourself what else in this hotel isn't clean. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else when you are in San Diego. This hotel is overpriced (with internet and parking it was $400+ per on a weekend) for the quality and they bait and switch.

We called twice before someone arrived with a chair, it was dirty and we had to clean it before we could use it. Our room had several non working outlets.

At check-in, the woman behind the desk gave me keys to a room in the tower, which she said had two double beds. When I told her I had requested a king, she switched me to another room in the lanai section on the ground floor. The room was clean, spacious and comfortable. There was a patio with sliding glass door that faced the tennis courts. The TV was a large flat-screen. The shower had one of those fab shower heads with a million little jets (and great water pressure). Oh, and the bed was super comfy. Housekeeping was great. The bed was made every day, and any towels that were left on the floor were replaced with fresh ones. While it is true that the hotel will award a $5 gift card to use on the premises for every night the housekeeping services are denied, it is by no means a requirement to accept this offer. Normally, I avoid eating in (chain) hotels like the plague. Usually the offerings are lame and overpriced. We ended up having a late dinner one night in the hotel bar, and it was actually just as good as if we had gone out somewhere, and not super expensive. There were some surprisingly decent beer selections, as well. The main reason for my stay was because of work, and I was a little skeptical when I saw that the exhibit room was actually a giant white tent outside the hotel. It was a little strange, but certainly better than the dungeon-like, subterranean exhibit areas of other hotels. Equally important, the boxed lunches were way above average, and the deli-style lunch on the last day of the exhibits was pretty tasty. With all these great things, I will say that there was a lack of customer service in some areas. I tried getting in touch with someone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c anyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c about a shipment that was being held for me, and I had to call practically every number just to get someone to finally answer a phone (thank you, concierge-lady).

Not wanting to make a big deal about it we checked in. It took 25 minutes before the desk answered my call to bring up our luggage. By that time my husband had self parked our car, gotten a coffee and made his way back to our room only to have to turn around and go get our luggage himself. We went to meet my sister in law who we were traveling with who was in the Marina Tower for dinner. We went to Quinns as the other restaurant was not open?? In our order of fish and chips we were served a piece of deep fried plastic that was still attached to the fish. My husband nearly choked on it thinking it was a bone! Our waitress did her best but she was missing in action most of our meal. When the Manager did come over he offered to comp the dish. Unfortunately, not wanting to make a scene in front or our 2 small children we said okay. Needless to say, the meal was ruined for everyone and no one finished their meals. $90.00 for food no one could eat and service that was unacceptable. We went back to our hotel and the next morning my husband woke up with a huge bug bite on his leg, when we pulled back the sheets on the bed bugs flew out.

They claim it one property but it is two. Dont be fooled by the web site as the amenities at the bay tower are poor. Pool tiny, fitness center a joke (a couple of cardio machines and some dumbells). The main marina tower has 2 pools and a proper fitness center. It has the nice restaurants and the Starbucks. The main tower offers movies by the pool at night (Weekends) and has other fun daily pool activities. Bay tower nothing. You feel like a second class citizen and not worthy of the Sheraton name. The one redeeming quality of both properties is the view. Rooms are average sized at best but was clean and oder free. Bathroom was small and the toilet was loud and sounded like a cruise ship toilet and toilets flushing can be heard through out your stay. Balcony was nice with a view of the bay. Beds and pillows were comfy. On my last night they slipped my statement and it said everything was paid in full and was Charged $288. As my room was pre paid I was not too happy with what I saw. I went to reception and they corrected the problem. Just beware every person ahead of me had a problem with over charging. From a 70 year old man being charged for the entire contents of his mini bar (apparently he bumped into it) to another person being charged for an extra day.

Next, the restaurant and bar is being serviced by one-person when their is a convention in town- really- one person. I waited almost 20 minutes for a bell-hop to come and pick-up my luggage. No- wife in 2010 when you are paying over $200.00 a nite - unacceptable. Cheaper hotels have free wife. Lat but not least. I needed to fed-ex something back home and you have to go over to the first tower to the fed-ex location to pikc-up the boxes and then just because you are in the second tower you must pay an additional $10.00 to ship- just because I was not in the main tower- aren't you all the same establishment- just different towers, I cannot believe just because the hotel chose for me to stay in the Bay Tower instead of the Marina Tower that a delivery is going to cost me an additional $10.00. I was very unhappy with this stay and based on the traveling that I do for business and pleasure I need the Sheraton to look into these areas for improvement as well as classify the difference between going green and shortage of housekeeping service. I also forgot the main desk mixing up a delivery package between my co-worker and myself- thank goodness we knew each other to make the change. Or my package would have went to another customer.

The only thing that we were concerned about was that pets were allowed in the hotel and my husband is allergic to pets. I did not see on the website that the hotel was pet friendly and if I had known that I would of put a note in the reservation to make sure that we were not in a room that just had a pet in it. The lobby had nice places to sit and relax however we preferred to be outside. The weather was lovely and they were showing a movie in the pool area the night we arrived. The fitness center was a nice feature that had adequate amount of treadmills, stationary bikes and weight equipment. They also have two ping pong tables so that the kids and adults can play. The pool area was very cute and clean when we went the next morning. If you book in the Club Level you are given access to the Club Lounge the next morning which provides you a nice continental breakfast. If you are able to get a good deal on the Club Level it is worth the upgrade. I think it is a great hotel for families who can splurge on a nice weekend get away or vacation. The only negative is the parking, if the hotel is full you might have a hard time finding parking closer to your tower. Not everyone might enjoy the long walk from the parking lot to their building. In addition, the parking is a $22.00 fee and I would hope that the management would improve the parking situation. P.S.

We just returned from a 3 night stay at this property, at which I'd reserved the AAA 'Hot Deals' rate which includes an upgrade to a deluxe room and $50.00 food/beverage credit per day. I printed the confirmation which stated our rate of $159.00 per night was for a room in the Bay Tower, along with the upgrade/credit Terms associated with that AAA deal. When we arrived, I was given the keys to a room in the Lanai section of the hotel (basically, out in the boondocks .. obviously an older part of the hotel and on the ground floor). I asked about the Bay Tower room on my confirmation and was informed the hotel was100% booked and it was all they had. I could check the next day for an upgrade. It was somewhat late (9:45pm) and we were exhausted - - so we went to the room. It was clean, and decorated in a crisp nautical decor .. but the ceiling seemed lower than normal, giving it a cavelike feel and the windows opened up to the back of the green tarp surrounding the tennis courts and a rooftop full of steam vents, etc. peaking over that. The extremely bright lights of the tennis courts were a nuisance. The showerhead was impressive looking.. the size of a dinner plate! ...but the water pressure was pitiful. I couldn't believe we'd paid $159.00 .. plus $22.00 parking and taxes, amounting to about $200.00 a night - for this! I've gotten some pretty decent rooms through Priceline for less than half that at other hotels. Ugh. The next morning, I went to the front desk and asked to be moved. They had a room available in the Marina Tower, 7th floor...which sounded like a drastic improvement over the room we spent the night in. My husband and teenage daughter were off taking sailing lessons in the harbor for Father's Day .. so I decided to take the room and move our stuff so they could be happily surprised at the end of their day. Silly me, I asked if there could be SOME sort of compensation .. perhaps a comp. day of parking? .. for my troubles and the fact that we were actually downgraded instead of upgraded - - but the gentleman said the parking is separately owned and he couldn't discount it. Terrible customer service, in my opinion. After getting all of our belongings into the new room, I noticed the air conditioner was not working! Aaaggghh!!! I called maintenance not once, but twice .. and after 2 hours of waiting - - the guy arrived and quickly fixed it. At that point I was just relieved to not have to move again. LOL. Now for some positives .. the hotel itself has a very appealing ambiance with the nautical decor and gorgeous views of the water, boats, etc. The pool area is nice as well, with rock work and waterfalls and daily activities for the kids. The restaurant food was good, although pricey ($68.00 for breakfast for the 3 of us, $20.00 for a plate of chicken nuggets/fries and a soda) and is set along an expansive wall of windows overlooking the harbor as well. There's a Starbucks in the lobby, so at least there's an option for something less expensive. The rooms are comfortable and fresh, lovely views (from the tower rooms..haha) but be prepared to hear the sound of jets taking off at the airport which is in very close proximity. The Fitness Center is large, lots of equipment. And next to that are a couple of ping pong tables .. which people seemed to be enjoying every time I was in the gym. The parking lot is also a big negative. WAY too small for such a large property. If you go down one aisle and can't find a spot, it is blocked on one end and you have to actually back up to exit to look down the next aisle! Two out of the three nights, we returned after going into town - - only to find NO parking available except for way out on the Lanai side of the hotel. We had to walk all the way through that section to the Marina Tower to our room. Shoulda stayed in the cave, I guess. Last, but not least, when we received our bill on the last day - - the $50.00 per day food/beverage credit was nowhere to be found.

We used one every morning for breakfast at the restaurant at the Bay Tower. We thought this was really a nice place to stay. We wanted to go to La Jolla and w/o a car it would have been expensive by taxi. There is a visitor information center down by the Harbor who can give you any information you need to get around.

I believe they have movie showings throughout the summer on Fridays and Saturdays on large screens outdoors. The room was nice with a very comfortable bed and a flat panel TV. The bathroom was on the smaller size but perfectly adequate. There was a balcony with a few lounge chairs that gave us a view of the marina. The hotel is a block away from the airport so if you have a morning or evening flight and want a hotel right near the airport, this is your choice. For the most part we really enjoyed the hotel.

When we asked the Concierge about the airport shuttle, they said we could catch the first shuttle with no problem. As it turned out, we had to wait 2 shuttles before we could get to the airport.

This was an extra special trip for my husband's 40th b-day. ALL the Sheraton staff (kudos to the manager, Keri Robinson, in particular) went above and beyond to make the stay so special for us. The views from our balconies (yes, two!) were superb. Dining at both the pub/restaurant and the Sheraton Dining Room within the hotel were excellent. I think the Pub/restaurant was a very good value for the $. Some reviewer noted a lumpy bed. Well, not in the room I had. Yummo-- I slept like a princess. The staff was always wearing a kind smile, but not in a fake attitude way that you sometimes encounter at hotels. If ever in San Diego again I will definitely stay at this hotel. Although this hotel is often overlooked by cruisers for a prestay visit, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. Cabs can take you anywhere you want to go pretty quickly. Also car rentals can be found super cheap if you do comparison shopping. The parking was a little high, but the place is well worth it in my opinion. ~ (Parking fees are clearly stated on the website so I don't know why people on here complain about not having prior knowledge of it.

I stayed there because my conference was in the hotel. I didn't see any cockroaches. There was no green water coming from the faucet. It has an excellent view of the harbor.

Also problematic for sleeping was that the walls were so thin you could hear anything and everything going on in neighboring rooms, even coughs. This hotel really needs to invest in some soundproofing. The hotel is not within walking distance of anything. You need to take a cab to get anywhere. It wouldn't be so bad if the restaurants in the hotel were really good...they are not horrible but not places I would want to eat every meal for five days. There was a sound akin to that of crickets in the vent. I called the reception to get them to fix it, they said they would come, but never did. I called again and still no action, then gave up.We had to call the reception to get the bathtub unclogged. They did eventually come and got it cleared but the drain was still pretty slow and got worse as the week went on. About half the times we called the reception there was no answer. The concierge was not that helpful. I stayed in the hyatt near the convention center during an earlier conference and oh how I longed to have been staying there as our taxi passed it on our way to restaurants.

I was disappointed however, after reading the hotels website, at the room we ended up with. We got what I like the refer to as the 'Priceline Shaft'. This is when you typically end up in a room that is of lesser quality than a regular room in the hotel, simply because you booked on Priceline. Some hotels can't do this because all rooms are basically identical. The Sheraton Marina, on the other hand, quite easily put us in this category. To be honest, there was nothing really wrong with the room itself. I was more put off by the location. The website advertised how almost all the rooms had a view of the skyline or the marina. Ours had a view of the backside of a tennis court. Not only that, but we were in some random satellite building that wasn't really connected well to the hotel. I also was severely unimpressed about the fact that our room had exterior corridors, very motel-like. There was no security for my door and anyone could have wandered up the driveway and knocked on our door. It was really bizarre to see this type of building in a Sheraton - I was certainly not expecting it. Once I accepted the motel atmosphere, the room was fine. It was fairly standard with most Sheratons, but decorated in a nautical theme. We had two beds, a desk, and a bathroom. It was not an overly large room, but not small by any means. The bathroom was a bit tiny and the lack of ventilation in it, something I find common in the US, was a little suffocating. Outside the room, the hotel had a full service Starbucks that we enjoyed although I think the prices were mildly higher than normal. There was also a restaurant and a lounge that we did not sample. I didn't see a fitness center, though I'm sure one exists. We walked by the pool a couple of times to get to the main hotel - it seemed nice. Never busy due to the cooler climate. Rooms contain internet for a fee, or you can go to the lobby for free wireless. There is also the Sheraton Link in the lobby, which provides free computers with internet for registered guests. At other hotels this area has been packed with people however I rarely saw anybody using them at this hotel. Location wise you are not really around much, but it is still a nice location. The airport is basically next door, so it is convienient if you are using it in conjunction with an airline. The marina is behind the hotel, if for some reason you are headed in that direction. My favorite part was that is was located on Harbor Island (not an island - attached to land). This provided a long Bay-front walking path with fantastic views. A drive downtown was 5 minutes. Overall this hotel was satisfactory to stay at. I wasn't happy with being in the two level outside building, and there were a few expensive add-ons ($22 parking etc.) that irritated me during my stay.

The rooms were clean, and the bed and pillows were super comfy! Slept well the 3 nights I was there. The fitness center is nicely equipped, but the location was kind of weird to me- had to go outside and walk under the foundations of the hotel to get to it. I found it kind of creepy and scary when I had to go there by myself one night to get to the lone vending machine (which is next to the fitness center.) The rooms have complimentary Starbucks coffee. They also have a mini-bar/refrigerator in room which is on sensors and costs an arm and a leg, so don't even open it up!! (And don't move anything inside it, or you will be charged.) There were no vending machines around to purchase drinks, so you are stuck drinking water from the bathroom sink, or paying for a drink out of the mini-bar or one of the restaurants. (Hint- the fitness center does have a filtered water dispenser, so take an empty water bottle with you, and fill up in there. Run on the super nice treadmills for a few minutes if you don't want to feel like you are stealing! LOL) Showers were warm and felt great. There is supposedly a \"spa\" in the fitness center. Didn't see it. Think maybe it is just a room where they do facials ($95 for one hour) and massages with appointments. Location-wise: it was very close to the airport, and there is a shuttle that runs from the airport to hotel (and back) every 15 minutes or so. My friend and I were on a tight budget, so we thought we could walk most places from the hotel (the Gaslamp District, Balboa Park, etc are about 3 miiles away), but that's simply not feasible. Luckily, cabs are waiting for you at the hotel, and most downtown locations are within a $10 cab ride. Make sure you take the number of the cab company and a cell phone with you, though, because you can't just hail a cab when you are ready to return to the hotel, since they don't patrol the streets just looking for their next fare. You'll just need to call them, and they'll send out their next available ride to pick you up. The fare starts when you get in the car (not when you call.) Be sure to ask the concerierge where the closest X is before you just get in the cab and go. My friend and I wanted to go to IHOP for breakfast one morning, so we just jumped in the cab without researching the location. $20 cab fare later, we showed up at IHOP. Which, of course meant that we had to pay another $20 to get back. Most expensive IHOP pancakes I ever had! :) We would have been better off ordering room service and paying the $16 for 3 pancakes. I would really recommend renting a car and traveling up to La Jolla to visit Torrey Pines and the coves and beaches there. You can do a 12 hour car rental if you don't want to pay the $22 overnight parking fee. I'm starting to digress here, so let me just summarize with this: If you are looking for a clean comfy place to just sleep and take showers, this is a great hotel. If you are one who likes to use up everything that a hotel has to offer, this will probably end up being a very expensive vacation for you.

When I asked her how this could possibly happen, she suggested that the morning housekeeper may have cut herself and bled on the sheets. When we requested that the ENTIRE bed be re-made, she provided us with new pillowcases as well. Absolutely no attention was paid to the blanket, mattress cover or the duvet. When we again asked for the entire bed to be attended to, she muttered something about the hotel's policy to save water; and then, when pressed for details, seemingly forgot how to speak English. We were too tired to request another room, had only a few hours before our early morning departure, so I thought that a Trip Advisor review would be more effective than just complaining to the management.

There was a work desk with data ports for working but we set up a bar on the table. The room was a tad tight with the beds and furniture but was very doable for just two in the room. The bathroom was of good size and had a large vanity. The shower had good pressure and plenty of hot water. The amenities were nice. We ate breakfast in the restaurant and it was expensive and the service was very slow and the food was warm. Next time I might eat breakfast elsewhere. We almost had dinner in the sports bar but it was just too expensive for foo-foo-ish bar food so we took the car out of parking and drove to downtown to eat. Self parking was $22 per day, ouch.

We walked to several local restaurants on the island and always felt invigorated. the rooms are in big need of renovation. We were in the older tower and you could tell. From what I understand the newer tower had just gone through a renovation and the older tower was next. Could not be soon enough. The room was loud and 70's throughout.

It was way nice for the price, so no complaints there. The rooms were very nice, but the room we had was somewhat small. Maybe if it was a king bed it would've felt roomier, but compared to our previous hotel it was a bit tight, but not bad for the 2 nights we were there. The hotels in a very convenient spot to the airport, and is somewhat centralized with the beaches just a few short miles away, and the zoo/downtown about the same distance in the other direction. The beds were VERY comfortable I will say. Out of the 3 hotels we stayed at during the week of our vacation, the beds here were our favorite. I gave this hotel a 4 out of 5 stars because: The 3 biggest downfalls for us was the cost of parking, no free Wi-Fi in the room, & no fridge...for $22/day you'd think you'd get valet, but no valet is $28/day. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really pointless to pay for valet when the valet parking lot is right beside the standard lot. I know paying to park is pretty standard in SD, but $22/day is just getting up there. You'd think for that kinda money to park they'd at least give you free Wi-Fi in the rooms, but only place you're getting it is downstairs. For us, using Skype and talking to family on the webcam is quite pointless downstairs in front of everyone! Lol Far as having no fridge, well, you get the mini bar area in the room which costs $$$$ plus it's not even cold so. Not to mention if you DID get caught putting anything in there, they charge a $25 cleaning fee.

This was also the only room in the hotel with this view. I went down the the lobby to request a room change and the hotel staff said they would not change it. I asked to speak with a manager and the front desk manager, Lynne, told me that it is against their policy to change people's rooms regardless of reason. I was not asking for a better room, nor was I asking for a higher floor, simply another (equal) room on the same floor. She said that they had none available. That is fine, but there was no offer of another room on a different floor. I asked for the courtesy of being moved to a different floor and was told they would be happy to upgrade me at no fee however they had no king beds available on any other floor for the weekend. I found this hard to believe, so I came back again and asked if I could be upgraded to another room if I paid the difference - suddenly a room was available. This simply revealed a blatant lie by the hotel manager, Lynne, which I do not appreciate. When I pointed this out, she said that she could not accomidate me at the same rate. I very much wanted to enjoy my vacation so I agreed to pay the extra money to move, however when we went to the new room it smelled strongly of smoke (in a smoke free hotel). I asked to be moved again and was told no, and asked for it to be cleaned to get rid of the smell. They sent someone up, but it did not help and the smell did not go away all trip. Lastly, housekeeping did not come to make up the rooms until at least 5pm each day, which is when I called the desk and demanded someone be sent up to clean the room.

I was able to use their spa service and had an excellent massage. They offer facials too and all services priced reasonably. Their spa is not really the type of spa that you go in to relax but it has more of the fitness club feel with showers and sauna. Hopefully they have a real spa lined up in the future. The only thing I could complain about is the Harbor's edge restaurant, for some reason, someone overlooked the fact that there are no ramps to get to the dining area.

Yes, we were placed in the Bay Tower, which they called the West. We were on the fourth floor -- which was really the third -- and we overlooked the parking lot. Lovely. Yes, there was some water and city views beyond, but with the parking lot three floors below it is hard to enjoy. Tried to take a dip after check-in at 8:30 PM... all towels gone and the pool a bit murky. The room looked nice, but had a few issues. One, there was no information in the room about the hotel services, cost of internet, location of amenities -- nothing. We had to call to find out about all of these things. Do they charge for the coffee and tea? I still don't know. Though I do know that if you put personal items in the minifridge they will charge you a $25 cleaning fee. Really. Two, and I have not seen this mentioned here before, but the duvet, while attractive, weighed about two hundred pounds.

We had an awesome experience but only after we did some tweaking of our room location. We booked through Hotwire at a rate of $114 and upon arriving at the Marina Tower (there are two towers - the Marina and the Bay - around the corner from each other) the valet politely informed us we were in the Bay Tower. After reading the previous reviews we expected this as it appears the Bay Tower is used for their Hotwire and Priceline customers. We arrived in the beautiful Bay lobby and were informed our \"standard\" room was either on the first floor in the back of the tower facing the marina or on the second floor in the front of the tower which was level with the parking lot. We choose to look at the first floor room and found a very large, very clean room with floor to ceiling windows that didn't open, a walkway right outside the windows and a beautiful view of the marina. The second story room, although we didn't go into the room, had a balcony but looked right onto the parking lot and then the bay. We didn't like the idea of feeling trapped with windows that didn't open, the lack of privacy with a walkway just outside the windows or staring at cars so we asked for a room higher up. We were informed we were only entitled to a first or second story room and that we'd need to pay $20 a night (plus taxes) to move up. We decided to upgrade and asked to be moved to the Marina tower. The Bay Tower's rooms are large, the pool is very nice, and there's free wi-fi in the lobby, a breakfast room and a business center. The two towers are about a 5 minute walk around the marina and is quite lovely. Perhaps in bad weather it would not be so pleasant. The Bay Tower is a lot quieter if that's what you are looking for. The Marina Tower is where the action is. Our Marina Tower room was on the 9th floor overlooking the pool and the marina. FABULOUS! The small balcony was wonderful and when we closed the sliding doors we could barely hear the airplanes. The room was large (not quite as large as the Bay Tower), very clean, beautifully decorated, and with a good sized bathroom. We enjoyed Happy Hour and a beautiful sunset at the Shoreline Restaurant next to the pool, then dinner at Quinn's, the pub that overlooks the pool and marina. The pub had decent prices and good food and wasn't dark like you'd expect a pub to be. There were two billiard tables for their customers to use. There are two pools in the Marina tower, the main one which is large and next to the Shoreline and the other is smaller and quieter. There are hamocks to relax on and rocking chairs around a fire pit. Harbor Island is flat so it's great for walking and running. I rented a bike one morning ($7 an hour, 4th hour free) and totally enjoyed riding along the water to the Star of India, USS Midway and Seaport Village. I felt very safe as I never had to be on the road with the cars and it only took 25 minutes to get to Seaport Village. The $20 upgrade was well worth it as we loved our room and the view it offered. The elevators were slow, in fact two of the days one of the elevators was being working on but we didn't mind much. We enjoyed the free US Today newspapers and the Starbucks coffee and tea in the rooms. Parking is $22 a night but it seems to be the going rate in the downtown area. We've stayed at other downtown hotels and have paid that amount and more to park. If you don't have a car taxis are readily available (at least at the Marina Tower, I'm not sure about the Bay Tower). Being right next to the airport would be very handy if you have an early morning flight as the Sheraton has a free shuttle, doesn't feel like an airport hotel and yet you are so close. The only negative thing I can say about the Sheraton was how they initially made us feel since we booked with Hotwire. My husband and I have booked a number of hotels through Hotwire and never before have we been made to feel \"cheap\" or told \" . . because you booked through Hotwire . . .\" Our past experience is that if a hotel has available rooms it will upgrade us at no charge and there's never any mention of who we booked through. It appears that Sheraton sets aside the least desirable rooms for their \"cheap\" customers, in fact the entire first floor of the Marina tower had different lighting and lower ceilings than the other halls. I think the only windows that don't open are those on the first floor on the Bay Tower so that's why they are given to the Hotwire and Priceline customers. All in all, a great experience and we will come back.", "Date": "August 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable with GREAT views!\u201d", "Author": "Lorio", "ReviewID": "UR36178683", "Content": "We stayed at the Sheraton San Diego for five days in July as a quick summer get-a-way - I do love this hotel because of the location by the marina and it has more of a resort feel.

We waited OVER 20 MINUTES to get on the elevator, when we were trying to check out the morning of our departure. (We had entirely too many bags to be lugging down the stairs.) We'd overheard a conversation during our stay, from a fellow guest of the hotel, that they'd been there since Tuesday and only ONE elevator had been operational during their stay as well...that was a total of 5 days, of which we were aware of. We did advise the front desk staff, and a \"Manager\" on duty of the elevator issue- they said they'd look into it....(short for that's nice, go away...) I'm grateful that all the guests in our group were able-bodied, and could handle taking the stairs the other two days of our stay... Overall, a great place to stay, friendly staff, and centrally located to many attactions. :) IF YOU STAY IN THE MARINA TOWER ON THE 3RD FLOOR, MAKE SURE TO INQUIRE IF BOTH ELEVATORS ARE WORKING. :O) **ALSO, BEWARE OF THE PARKING FEE- $22 PER NIGHT FOR SELF PARKING, AND $28 A NIGHT FOR VALET.**", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Imperial County CA", "Title": "\u201cCant be beat for the Fourth of July!!\u201d", "Author": "TravelingCabron", "ReviewID": "UR34360030", "Content": "Nice place, staff was cool.

To her defense, they were full with a teacher's convention but she could have handled our request in a better manner. The Bay tower does have its own pool and fitness center both of which we took advantage. We hit the pool around 4:30pm - the pool attendent was gone as were all the pool towels. The fitness center was capable - the equipment was fairly new and there was enough variety to get in a decent cardio or weight workout. Would like to recognize the Valet attendent who took care of us when we were looking for cheaper parking options. We told him we were not going to park in the hotel and would move the car somewhere else after checkin.

It takes about 5 minutes to walk from one to the other. The Marina hotel is DEFINITELY the nicer hotel and has all the amenities. Second, the hotels are very close to the airport and offer a FREE SHUTTLE to and from the airport. We did not rent a car the entire trip. We were given a room in the BAY tower (so for the purpose of this review, I will be grading the Bay tower), which was nice, but there were no amenities. We were notified at check-in that the pool and hot tub in the Bay tower would be closed until June 14 at least, but that we could walk over to the Marina hotel and use that pool. The room was nice...it had a nautical-themed decor. We had an excellent view of the marina and all the boats out our patio door. The comforter was down or something like that, but it made crinkly noises when you moved or rolled over. Also, there was no public computer to use, again that was located in the Marina tower. We had to go over there to check e-mail because we didn't bring our laptop. I think the Bay tower had wireless internet if you have your laptop with you. The spa and fitness center were also located in the Marina tower along with bicycle rentals and various other activities. The location was great though. There is a shuttle pick up near the hotel that can take you to Sea Port Village for the Trolley tour.

The airport car rental return is literally across the street ... I walked about a quarter mile back to the hotel. The only negatives to this place are the cost of parking ($22/night) and the prices at the restaurant. The breakfast buffet was $22 for adults and $10 for kids. The only other place to eat within walking distance is a small cafe between the towers next to the marina, and they only serve breakfast and lunch.

It was great sitting out on the balcony with a cup of coffee. Stay 2 was a also a deluxe room, and just as nice, although the view of the parking lot wasn't as nice as that of the marina. If you are staying for leisure, I recommend paying the extra for a marina view. I think it's worth it. During stay 3, we were given a club room, but ironically I enjoyed the deluxe rooms better. We originally reserved a king deluxe, but upon arrival were told we were upgraded to a club room. However, they gave us a double bed room. I just think it's strange having an extra, empty bed there. They must have been remodeling as well, which I hadn't seen any signs of in my previous stays. They were redoing the wallpaper on the floor we were on, which is fine, but there weren't any \"pardon our mess signs\" or taped off areas, so it just looked a little shabby, unlike the rest of the hotel. We did get a chance to have breakfast in the club lounge and that was fantastic. The lounge is beautiful and the breakfast was nice, albeit it being a hyped up continental breakfast. Overall, I've been pretty happy with Sheraton hotels. I recommend getting room service and ordering their seafood melt sandwhich. mmmm.

Oh, and it's GREAT having a starbucks in the hotel as well. :) I'm hoping next time I have a chance to enjoy the hotel's other amenities.", "Date": "May 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cNice relaxing stay near San Diego airport\u201d", "Author": "Tarepanda", "ReviewID": "UR29058857", "Content": "I stayed overnight at the Sheraton Bay Tower (the smaller Sheraton) which is about a 7 minute walk from the Sheraton Marina.

The room was outfitted with a sofa and armchair, a table/desk with two cushioned chairs. The minibar was one of those annoying electronic sensor types. There were small touches; grey marble counter tops in the bathroom and leather pulls on the dresser drawers that gave the room a luxurious feel. The balcony looked over the Navy base across the water with downtown San Diego in the distance. The only problem I had with the hotel was that I could hear the toilet flushing from the rooms above and beside mine, granted the toilets had a powerful flush. I noticed a large number of airline crew were staying at the hotel.

The reviews were mixed so we weren't sure what to expect. However, after spending nearly a week there, we had nothing to complain about whatsoever and really enjoyed our stay. First, I'll address the negatives from other reviews. We found the staff to be very friendly. The concierge was very helpful, the front desk upgraded us to a 9th floor marina view even though we got a great deal via a Priceline bid. The restaurant staff was solid too. (Scott, the bartender at the lobby (Tapatini) bar was excellent). Even the housekeeping staff was friendly and had smiles on their faces. The airport noise did not bother us. When we had the balcony door open we heard a few planes during our stay, but not too many and it wasn't that loud. Unless you plan on staying on the property all day, this really shouldn't be an issue. The hotel is right by the airport, so it is not as central to attractions as it could be. We knew this going in and planned on using cabs to get downtown (both for our conference and to eat in the Gaslamp District and check out Seaport Village). The parking rates are high (more than $20/night), so we figured a 10 minute cab ride downtown (about $10)would be worth it and it was. There is a cab stand at the hotel and that way you don't have to worry about parking, etc. We did stay in the main (Marina) tower. The Bay tower is about a 5 minute walk down the marina, so I can understand why people staying there would be a bit inconvenienced, as the main restaurants are in the Marina tower. About two-thirds of the rooms are in the main tower. The hotel was renovated in late 2008 and it really looks great, inside and out. We had a great stay. While the Bay tower might be too far away for some (the PapaNani's deli is a hidden gem for good casual/cheaper food and snack and is located on the path between the towers), the other complaints about this property seemed unfair, at least based on our 6-night stay there. We would definitely come back, even if we had a car and had to pay $20-$25 a night to park it (we are talking about San Diego after all, parking is never cheap in places like that).", "Date": "April 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redondo Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cComic Con 2007\u201d", "Author": "Spillthemoment", "ReviewID": "UR27615043", "Content": "I spent 4 nights at this hotel as part of Comic Con 2007 (Comic Con is a citywide conference which pretty much sells out every hotel room in the San Diego area.) Upon arrival parking was relatively easy to find as it is adjacent to the hotel BUT the parking lot was full, so once we found a parking spot, we went through the nearest hotel entrance we could find and it was a very long TIRING walk to the front desk. The front desk staff was very courteous and cordial and check-in was speedy. We were checked into a room in the Marina Tower (the main tower) and we were VERY disappointed. We had requested a room with a King bed but were checked into one with two beds instead. The room was very basic and it was quite noisy, as well. IF we had stayed in this room for the duration of our stay, I would have been thoroughly dissapointed. The following morning we received a call from the Front Desk stating that if we desired we could move to a room in the Bay Tower. We packed up our things, drove to the other Tower (it IS necessary to drive between the Towers...too far to walk) and boy, were we pleased. The Bay tower has quite the resort feel to it and it is adjacent to the Marina (not sure about the Marina Tower as our room there faced the main street) The lobby was very elegantly decorated and the rooms were very large and cozy and were decorated in a tasteful nautical theme. It was much quieter in this Tower and the vibe was much more laid-back than it was at the main tower. They should be two different hotels!! My advice: Stay at the Bay Tower unless you are there overnight on a layover and only care about the bed... Also for those attending Comic-Con, this hotel is located at a very good location. The Comic-Con trolly makes pickups right outside the main entrance, and the Comic- Con room rate was very reasonable, as well.

Specifically, the restaurant no longer offers menu service for breakfast - it is buffet only. The buffet is probably better than average, but it is getting a bit pricey at $21.00 per person. We gave up the convenience and went elsewhere for the ability to order off the menu, and at least attempt to stay within our per diem limits. The hotel has also discontinued the newspaper service, so no more USA Today at the door when you get up.

The balcony to the marina was beautiful.. but bird poop on the railings and chair (i did not sit outside) The airport noise did not bother me at all. Work conference had sessions posted in both towers... so lots of walking (short 3-4 min walk) was nice. In between the two towers was an amazing little deli/store called Papa Nani's. Lifesaver to those on a budget! They offered breakfast, lunch (hot and cold sandwiches) and assortment of salads in addition to sodas/juices/beer, snacks and small toiletry items. Wonderful and friendly staff. They even popped popcorn in their microwave for you to take back to your room! The hotel shuttles were fast and friendly drivers.

The bad: No fridge and no microwave. There was a mini-bar but I did not dare touch anything inside (outrageous prices) There were no vending machines but an overpriced gift shop was available. The solution? PapaNani's (see above) The Ugly: The internet in the business center went down on my final night (friday.) I could not check airport schedules or email family or work.

The front desk seemed very excited to tell us about the beautiful view of the Bay from our room, which it's true, we could see the bay...but the ugly parking lot was in between us and the bay.

There was a starbucks at the main Sheraton but we would have had to walk quite a distance or get in our car just to get a cup of coffee. The muffins were $3.00/ea. and the banana's were $1.50/ea. Which seemed like such a rip off...I mean we were spending $200/night and they had to charge us for a banana! On the day of Check out we got our bill slipped under our door and it had five (5) addit'l. charges. We inquired what these were at the front desk and they said that we ate the food out of the mini fridge. in the room, which we didn't. It was over $30.00 in charges that kind of just looked like service/tax fees had we not looked into it. They quickly got rid of the charges without any questions. Interesting enough our friends who were staying at the hotel too recieved charges from the fridge. which they had not even opened either. What a scam...had we not questioned it...they would have made an extra $30.00 off us...for nothing.They obviously do this often for they didn't even question our us about the additional charges they just removed them. I'm very dissapointed in the Sheraton, I thought that name stood for QUALITY ....this one proved that wrong. We also wanted to grab some food and a drink and since the bar at our Bay tower was closed at 9pm on a Friday night, we had to drive over to the Main Sheraton ( kind of a pain) we went to the little lounge and ordered drinks which took over 35 mins to get from the time we ordered...seriously are they trying to drive business away on purpose? We had some friends with us that had children , which the lounge said it was acceptable for them to stay until 11pm. We ordered food (which was okay...not bad but not fabulous) we then sat there waiting and waiting for our check. Our server was nowhere in sight, we finally asked a different server if we could please get our check, all of a sudden our server appeared with the check and told us that we needed to get out of there because it was past 11pm, well we would have been out of there by 10:30 had she not dissapeared on us. That was very poor service and unprofessional on her part. So to sum it up...we woudn't not stay there again. There were way too many scams and things that kind of blind sighted us.

I had a rate of $229.00 for a convention I was attending. $20 a day additional to park in the lot, with in and out privileges. Information desk was very helpful and gave us directions to anywhere we were heading. Bartenders nice inside the main hotel. A few minor things for improvements. Walls were a little thin and could hear kids in the next room only one day. One elevator kept breaking down. Bathtubs with mildew around the stopper that needed just a good scrubbing. Club level has one computer for all business people to share. Unfortunately the days I was there, children were always on it making it impossible to check e-mail during my breaks from the convention. 4 computers down in the lobby for everyone else to share and they always were being used. They did give a 30 minute limit. Pool area was clean and perfect temperature. Plenty of chairs so that you did not have to fight for space. Workout room attendant was very nice and the room was clean. Machines seemed in good working order. Beautiful walking paths across the street. The pool does rent rafts for kids and adults and that is a definite plus. Beautiful views front and back of the hotel. Fireplaces outside to sit around in the evening and talk to other guest. Wait staff around pool was slow and bartender for the outdoors could have been a little friendlier. Check out was very smooth and fast. I would definitely stay here again.

Our room, though not particularly large, was nicely decorated in a subtly nautical theme in warm wood tones, navy and cream. Of course, the little balcony and view of the pleasure boats moored below helped a lot! The spotless bathroom was well-lit, and had a granite countertop with a basket of toiletries and a curved shower rod, indicating it had been updated fairly recently. The only meal we had in the hotel was breakfast. The food was okay, but personally I don't think a totally basic breakfast for two should cost over fifty dollars. The only other amenity we used was the wi-fi in the lobby, which was available to hotel guests. Much appreciated.

After being there for 5 days, I have a better understanding of what it is about. As a disclaimer for this resort, I learned that it has been here for 40 years. With that said, you can look at areas of the hotel and see 40 years, and then others are as new as what you would find from a new construction hotel. This is how I break it down: THE LOBBY AND EMPLOYEES The lobby was beautiful and spacious with all the amenities you would expect from a finer hotel. There was a bellman stand and staffed concierge. The employees are top in serving your needs. Good hires that work with sincerity. There is a bar and restaurant in the lobby area that are both nice. ROOMS: This is a problem. There was a constant joke about the rooms being similar to a road side lodge. They are small. The bathrooms have been updated and were clean, as were the linens. The beds are comfortable and the room was satisfying overall, just nothing fancy or trendy. Be advised, not all rooms are interior corridors. You might need to be specific if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t' like your door opening to the outside. Some colors and d\u00c3\u00a9cor are showing age. EXERCISE ROOM: I have yet to find a hotel/resort exercise room than can accommodate everyone that is trying to exercise at 6 AM. It could have been larger. All the exercise equipment was tops, just limited. There was plenty to do to get a full workout. It is San Diego and the weather was beautiful. Many, including me, ran along the coast on concrete path. POOL: I believe there were three total. I saw two. Both of which were very nice and bigger than normal. There were plenty of chairs to satisfy anyone wanting to sit by the pool and bake. The pool was even depth all the way across. MEETING ROOMS: It was evident that when this resort made upgrades it was done to the meeting facilities. Really nice in every way. LOCATION: This was good and bad. If you are flying into San Diego, you could walk to and from this resort. Literally across the street. The resort sits on the water and there is a very nice running path that is next to the water. The Sheraton is to two separate buildings. I was in the main building but guess it is a good 10 minute walk to the other. There are a couple restaurants within walking distance, but it is a 10 minute cab ride to the Gas Lamp district. Overall I would stay here again. I am big on service and effort and this property exceeded my expectation on both. I guess it depends on what your plans are. This was my fourth trip to San Diego in the past 4 years. With that said, I have stayed in 4 different properties. The other three were in and around the convention center.

Although directly across from the airport, I never had an issue hearing planes inside my room. The Marina Tower building is the very large building you'll see on the hotel website. The lobby was very nice, receptionists very helpful. The rooms on this side varied - I saw one room on the lanai side which was kind of hidden at the very end of the hotel, and set up like a motel with the doors all facing an inner, outdoor courtyard. That room smelled very strongly of smoke (this is a non-smoking hotel room) and was dark and a bit run down looking. My own room was on the 10th floor, view was just OK - alot of the views are of the neighboring Coast Guard area or the airport, not exactly the beautiful marina and harbor you might be expecting. The room was clean, furniture a bit warn. The rooms over at the Bay Tower are larger (30% according to the front desk clerk) but the views aren't necessarily better. These rooms seemed newer and cleaner, with a Tommy Hillfiger type of atmostphere - lots of red and blue in the rooms. To anyone planning a large conference - don't dare let them stick your conference in that giant \"Pavilion\" room - it's a tent. A giant tent. With no bathrooms. And you'll hear every single plane and Coast Guard helicopter, every couple of minutes. People in the back of the tent could hear nothing at all. Add to that the wind blowing the whole thing the entire time, it literally sounded as though people were banging pots and pans outside the tent while speakers attempted to finish their speeches.

The shades are perfect for blacking out the room and the bed was standard (i.e. excellent) SPG sweet sleeper. I had a beer and empanadas at the bar, nothing special, in fact the empanadas were a bit dry, but I didn't complain since I was tired arriving at 9pm from NYC. The hotel restaurant and lounges were plenty busy and people were smiling, not sure if it was the Final Four or the food. There were plenty of weights and machines in the gym and it was not crowded for a Sat morning when there aren't too many people awake at 0700. The pool was nice and heated and would be very nice on a hot day. Signage to the gym could be improved as they get you in the right direction and then cease to exist, leaving you (me) wandering the floor hoping to trip into the gym. The location is good if you want to be close to the airport, but I can see how it would be a pain for those hoping to see San Diego. It's only 5-10 minutes to downtown, but this means a $10 cab ride each time you go in and then have to return. Walking would be a nice choice if you have 30-40 minutes, but there's a sidewalk along the bay with a great view.", "Date": "April 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spokane, WA", "Title": "\u201cCockroach in our room\u201d", "Author": "libertycdamac", "ReviewID": "UR14924284", "Content": "We just came back from staying here because we had too. First, we tried to cancel our room and move but note that you have to cancel a week prior to your stay. The hotel charges you for your whole stay a week prior to your stay. Second my husband was speaking at a conference there at the hotel. I should of know at that time this will be an interesting stay. It started out that I thought they had 24 hour shuttle service to the hotel. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t!! We got in late waited for the shuttle as instructed when I called to confirm my resevation. They did not bother to tell me that it does not run after midnight. They were aware that we were checking in late. We took a taxi over to the hotel. No big deal it was 7.00 with tip. It took less than 5 min. We checked into our first room at 12am and it smelled like a bar with horribly stained carpet. Looked like someone spilt bleach all over the floor. My thought was to try to cover up the smell of a bar. We moved at that time to another room on the 12th floor. Security was nice and helped us move. We moved to the \"new\" room instantly and there was a cockroach in the bathroom. Security was still there and took care of the cockroach but they could not move us again because of the conference was taking up the whole hotel. We tried to move hotels but we would still have to pay 250.00 a night (we were there for 4 nights). The next morning we woke up to another cockroach in the bathroom. We let them know they explained that happens at times. Yuck!!!!!! We are paying how much a night!!! Housekeeping can in a great job of cleaning and we did not see another one. The third night the whole room filled up with cigarette smoke at 3am. Someone down below us was smoking in the bathroom and because at night the circulation slows down the cigarette smoke went into our room through the vent in the bathroom. Again called front desk no one came up or even got a call from anyone that they even cared that we could smell smoke. My husband is sensitive to cigarette smoke and it was irritating. Again when we check in they made us sign that we will not smoke in the hotel or on the balcony but no follow through. The next day during the day I went down a spoke to one of the front desk people. He stated he would give us a comp day for the unconvinced of the cockroaches and smoke. An hour later he called and could not comp a whole night so he credit our portfolio with just 100.00 credit and a pass to the club house for Hord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeuvres and breakfast. That was really nice of them but we had dinner and breakfast at the conference provided for us. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think this was fair but what else you are going to do except let everyone else know that it may look clean but know this hotel has a problem with cockroaches and let others make the decision to stay here. If you do make a reservation check out that you cannot get out of your reservation if you do find a cockroach.

I hoofed it back to the front desk and they put me on the 12th floor--much safer. Overall, the hotel does not seem clean or designed well. A few points: - Someone else's dry-cleaning was put into my room. - There were divots on the toilet seat & shower and the faucets were installed backwards - Stains on the bathrooms walls & splashes on the coffeemaker - The curved shower rod made the bathroom door unable to open all the way, so you'd sit on the toilet with the door between your knees - Deep creases in the bedspread. The bed was so poorly made, it was almost as bad as if I had made it! - The iron was so worn that you could not tell the setting The good parts were the Starbucks and Tazo tea that were provided (intermittently). Beware the long line at Starbucks in the morning, especially if there is a conference in the hotel. The free shuttle from the airport was another nice feature. It really was a peculiar stay: far away from San Diego proper, odd room, extraordinarily loud lobby with a strong perfume scent.

As others have pointed out, this hotel is very isolated. It would definitely not be my first choice if I were in San Diego on vacation. The cab ride into town is about $12 each way. That adds a hefty price to the cost of a meal. We took the cab on the first night but then explored Harbor Island on foot the second day. There are 3 other restaurants on the island - one is exorbitantly priced and the other two are average quality seafood restaurants (the Lighthouse at the very end and the Boathouse). They are an easy walk from the hotel. Regarding the quality of the hotel: We stayed in the West Tower (the smaller of the two) which was a 7-10 minute hike from the conference facilities. The walk was pleasant, along the marina and provide a little exercise at the start of the day. The first room we were assigned was facing the airport (marina side) and that's where you could hear every plane take off. We quickly changed to a room facing the bay side, which was much quieter. The view from the balcony was quite nice and peaceful; you could see the Coronado bridge and downtown San Diego. In the room, the furnishings were typical but the bed was not comfortable. After 5 nights, we couldn't wait to get out of there. The bathroom toilet flushed with a very loud noise (kind of like the newer toilets on an airplane) - not a big deal until your neighbor flushed there's in the middle of the night and you heard it in your room. The other complaint is the inconsistency of the shuttle bus. It was great to have a free shuttle from the airport to the hotel; but, the shuttle was supposed to take you from one building to the other. There was no schedule so you could wait quite a while for it. Generally we walked but later at night, we didn't want to walk in the dark along the water so we waited and waited.", "Date": "March 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cOkay Only If you're not paying for the Room!!\u201d", "Author": "n2exploring", "ReviewID": "UR14614724", "Content": "I was in San Diego for a conference at this hotel, so thankful I did not have to pay for my stay. The advantage to being so close to the airport is also a major disadvantage with the noise factor. And as mentioned by other reviewers, the low flying frequent helicopters in the area were quite disturbing, especially if you tried to walk outside to enjoy the marina. I stayed in the east tower and was given a room on the first floor with a parking lot view! I was foolish not to ask for a better room, thinking that it wouldn't matter since I would be in meetings the majority of my time. Little did I know that the hotel would be the site of several wedding receptions that went late into the night. Imagine trying to sleep with the sound of loud celebrants outside my window, car fobs continually chirping as people returned to their cars, and car alarms going off without end! The room was well worn and partially for that reason didn't seem quite clean. I did appreciate the coffee maker in the room, but since it only brews one cup at a time, I can only imagine the negotiations that must go on between couples for the first cup! This hotel also boasts their huge internet center in the lobby. They have about 8 to 10 computers, but that is not helpful when all but 2 of them have \"Out of Order\" signs on them. I desperately wanted to print my airplane boarding pass since I had an early flight, but the 2 working computers were being monopolized by people that felt no sense of courtesy. Yes, there is a Starbucks inside the hotel. No, they will not honor any Starbucks gift cards that you may have. I did not dine in any of the restaurants, but the meals prepared for the the conference were wonderful. My room didn't have any hotel information books or maps so I have no idea how many restaurants were available or what they offered. I did consider room service one evening, but when I couldn't locate any menus, I gave up and bought a pastry from Starbucks. I was concerned because my return flight left at 6:30AM. I inquired and was told the Hotel Airport Shuttle would start running at 5:00AM, stopping at the other tower before heading to the airport. This concerned me because I am accustomed to flying out of Atlanta and you really need to allow time to get through long waits at security. I arrived to check out at 4:40AM. Although my room was covered, I always like to be sure that nothing has been put on my credit card. There was a gentleman checking out ahead of me and he was having huge issues. He went back and forth with the receptionist. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a Hotel Airport Shuttle pull up, load 2 passengers and take off! I looked at my watch and it was 4:50AM! The gentleman behind me looked at me and we both screamed in unison! Another shuttle arrived shortly after 5:00AM, and I climbed on not a minute too soon! All of us thought that since every seat was full that we would go straight to the airport and not stop at the other tower. WRONG!!! Can you believe that we had to try and load more passengers (who had to stand) and their luggage on an already filled to the max shuttle?? By this time I was so nervous that I was going to miss my flight, especially since we had to stop and unload passengers at each terminal. Mine was last. I really prefer to write good, positive reviews, but I appreciate the people that share their unpleasant experiences also. Maybe this will help someone make a better plan. I did not have a choice about where I stayed this time. If you are planning a vacation, please research other hotels that are better situated and better maintained than this one.

Arrangements were made by his associates at a special rate; hence I can't quote the usual price of this room. However, I would consider it to be run-of-the-house and standard. That said, it was fine. This should be considered a business hotel, rather than a vacation property. The Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina is one of two in the area in close proximity to Lindbergh Field, the San Diego International Airport. It is so close that one could practically walk there from the airport. We rented a car, though the hotel provides shuttles. The drive to the airport from the hotel is probably no more than five minutes. Though the location makes for a convenient launching point for San Diego activities, visitors should keep in mind that planes fly low over downtown San Diego creating a frequent roar of jet engines up above. The airport appears to close about midnight and not reopen until an early, but not unreasonable time the next morning. The planes are heard and seen from the hotel but didn't create a problem for us; they might for some. The hotel has over 1,000 rooms, all having balconys. Our room was what I would consider of an average size with two double beds and was comfortble enough for our adult daughter to spend two nights with us. It was tastefully decorated and all furniture, bedcoverings, etc. were crisp and clean upon our arrival. However, the view from this room was so enchanting that even a lesser appearing room would have gotten a thumbs-up here. The hotel faces San Diego Bay and our room had a glorious view of the city skyline and a great expanse of the bay. The room's small balcony with its table and two chairs was a class spot to enjoy your morning coffee while viewing the many sailboats and other vessels passing by. And as if to complement the daytime view, the San Diego night time brought on the city lights and a mad search for the proper camera exposure to capture them. The room was equipped with a television, clock-radio and a very simple little coffee maker that was fine for tea but questionable for coffee. For that ,management apparently wanted us to go into one of the hotel's restaurants. The room was also Internet equipped and the user would be connected for $11.95 a day. There was a stocked refrigerator in the room carrying sodas ($3.00), small waters ($3.50), Rice Krispies Treats ($4.00) and the like, \"all prices subject to a 20% restocking fee.\" We passed on this little Sheraton moneymaker. We were all thankful for our cellular phones here because Sheraton fiercely guards outgoing calls from its rooms. They charge $2.00 for access per local call, up to 60 minutes per call with .10 per each additional minute beyonyd that first hour. Toll free calls will set you back the same as above. Want operator assistance, or making a credit card call? It's all the same to these folks. If you need to call long distance your prices will be that much higher. Bring your cell! The hotel has a few restaurants and we dined at Quinn's, a casual sports bar offering adult sandwiches (no pb&j on the menu, though I am certain they would oblige if requested) such as the marinated skirt steak on a ciabatta roll which I had and a very fat pastrami sandwich selected by a friend. They had a wide assortment of appetizers and some nice main dish salads and the requisite soup for a seaside community, clam chowder. Prices were about what you would expect in a city hotel, with the chowder at $8.00 for an average sized bowl. Food was well prepared. As a full-service hotel, in-room dining is also offered, but be prepared for the food prices to be pumped up with Sheraton's version of thinking of its patrons' comfort (tongue in cheek here). The in-room menu reads \"For your convenience a 19% service charge and a $3.00 delivery charge will be added automatically.\" However, if this is not a determent then a very nice selection of foods is offered. Aside from a bank of computers in the lobby available to guests without charge, we did not use any of the other commercial offerings, but I did investigate what was available A \"Smart Office\" is set up with a computer, printer, speaker phone, scanner, fax etc. at $75.00/hr. This room is described as being appropriate for small meetings and interviews and has a capacity for up to four people. They have a spa and fitness center for a $10.00 daily fee for hotel guests. Various spa treatments are available and the center is equipped with cardiovascular equipment and body machines. Neither a hair salon nor manicurist was in the list of services. There is a small store selling the usual hotel merchandise and snacks but don't expect to find any semblance of solid nutrition (a bagel, for instance) there. Again, they want you in their restaurants so they can sell that bagel for $6.00. Everyone we met at this hotel, from check-in personnel, to wait staff, to maintenance, was extraordinarily nice. Apparently Sheraton takes the time to select and train its people and it shows. No complaints there! Beware of their parking arrangement. They charge $20/day for hotel parking, more for valet. An adjacent open lot charges $4.00 per hour and the charges just keep accruing. Check before you park so you won't be surprised.

It is far from perfect if you are traveling for pleasure/vacation. My boyfriend and I were visiting San Diego for a wedding and decided to book through hotwire.com. We landed the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. I had read reviews on trip advisor that the west tower had bigger, updated rooms but was further from the action and that the east tower was closer to everything but with smaller \"lanai\" rooms. When we arrived at the hotel (east tower) we were told that we were actually staying in the West Tower. I asked to be switched to an East Tower high room but was told that the hotel was overbooked and I should be happy I even have a room! (Nice, right?). So we drove over to the west tower, parked the car ($20 per night!), and unloaded our bags to find out that we were actually staying at the east tower. So we had to gather our things back to the car and drive over to the east tower where we were basically ignored to find our way to our room without any help with our luggage. The lack of organization and service was very disappointing. There was a large Enterprise convention going on at the hotel and it seems the staff was too busy helping those on business to help us out. We were given a subpar Lanai room on the 2nd floor with a less than stellar view. There is no safe in the room and water is $4.00. The room itself was standard. One of the restaurants was closed while we were there for the Enterprise convention. A cab ride to the Gaslamp district was about $15.00 with tip. The pool at the east tower is really nice. We never had to worry about finding a lounge chair and the view of the harbor is beautiful. At check out we were charged for 4 nights of parking even though we only had a car for one night.

It's almost like these travelers were staying at a different hotel... My husband and I took our two kids (12 & 14) for a 6 night stay at the beginning of July. We love San Diego, and this was our 4th stay at The Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. My 14 year old son chose to return here for his Middle school graduation gift as he & his sister always have a great time. I had actually contacted the hotel in response to the general---We looking forward to seeing you--- email that you receive after booking on the Hotel website. I addressed the email to Robert Cartwright, the Hotel's General Manager telling him that we would be returning and the reason for our visit, and to request a Marina/pool view room. I had booked a Club Level room in the East Tower as we truly enjoy the Club Lounge and the great views that it offers. I actually prefer the rooms over in the West Tower as they are larger, have a bigger balcony and I like their nautical theme, but there is no Club Level in the West Tower. After sending the email with my room request, I received a l reply from Mr. Cartwright.I was truly impressed by this very personal touch, but that was just the beginning! I checked in at the Starwood Preferred Guest check- in area, while my family waited outside with the car. I was told that we had a 2 rooms reserved for six nights, and I said there must be some mistake as I had actually only reserved one room. As it turns out, Mr. Cartwright really took great care of us. He gave us 2 adjoining rooms on the 9th floor, and while the 9th floor is not on the Club Level as I had reserved, the rooms are basically the same and we still had access to the Club Lounge. My kids were over the moon that they got there own room! It truly made our stay so much more comfortable to have that extra space for the week. We were also given complimentary valet parking for the duration of our stay! Now, I know some of you are probably thinking, of course after this special treatment I am going to give the hotel a great review, but if you knew me you would know that would not alter my judgment in anyway. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just the way that Mr. Cartwright made us all feel that made this such a great trip, but also many other members of the staff, from the front desk, to the wait staff, the concierge desk, the valet parking staff and bell hops, the gym staff, the bartenders, even the housekeeping and maintenance personnel. Every single hotel employee that we encountered were happy, friendly and truly accommodating people. And in my opinion, it is the people that are employed by a hotel that truly make a difference between a wonderful hotel stay and a so-so experience. You can be in the most luxurious hotel suite, in the most incredible location, but if the service and hospitality are not 5 star you are not going to be happy! We never had a bad meal at the hotel. The kids loved room service and food from Shoreline. the poolside restaurant. My husband and I liked Tapatini, and we all liked the Sunday brunch at Harbor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Edge. Some meals we charged to the room and some we paid cash for so the hotel bill didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel quite so bad at the end of our stay. But like the MasterCard commercials say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Quality time with your family, Priceless!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We took some great walks along the harbor in the morning, but my favorite part of the day was sitting on the balcony with a glass of wine just gazing at the sunset over the marina. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone just based on the staff alone. We will definitely be returning to the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina on our next trip to San Diego. p.s. Another wonderful thing about this and many other hotels in the Starwood hotel group is that they welcome small dogs; but please if you are going to bring along your pet, only do so if you can trust your pet to be well behaved, that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mess\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the room, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bark at all hours and you as the dog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s caretaker take full responsibility for cleaning up after their walks.

I was able to book two rooms via Priceline for a good price. When we pulled into the front of the hotel, a valet had a list of all reservations & directed us to the West Tower. This was helpful, as the East Tower's self parking lot is a dirt lot located about a 5 minute walk from the hotel entrance and it would have been an inconvenience to take the kids & luggage out & back in. The West Tower was about a 3 minute drive and located in front of the Marina & Harbor in the back. The check in went smoothly. The staff was helpful and was able to accommodate our need for connecting rooms (one room w/ handicap access) & waived parking fees since we had a disabled car sign. We were given a newspaper every weekday morning and not charged. Both rooms were clean and decorated with the nautical theme. Although the West Tower is away from all the amenities, it had it's benefits...such as larger rooms for the kids to run around, less foot traffic then in the other Tower, further away from the airport , beautiful views & parking (on pavement not, dirt) located in front - never had trouble finding space. We took a look at the East Tower and were annoyed that we couldn't find a space and then, had to park in the dirt lot.

For us, we didn't plan on using the pool or eating at the nicer restaurants so the West Tower better meant our needs. My only complaint was there was no laundry facility at the West Tower. I would classify the hotel as a three star only because there were standard features missing. Both rooms secondary locks were not working as well as a peephole that had a paper rolled into it. One of the sliding closet doors was not secured at the bottom, which caused the door to swing. For some reason the message light kept blinking. Overall, we enjoyed our stay there and would return.

Not everything that went wrong was their fault, but they couldn't make anything right. I went there with a colleague to attend a conference. This is a large property and we were put in rooms at opposite ends of the complex. A walk from one end to the other took 17 minutes, mostly outdoors. This wasn't a hardship because the weather was beautiful, but it made it tougher to meet up for breakfast or classes. The problem was that when we checked in, they couldn't find two rooms for us that were closer. The complex consists of several buildings. The East Tower is the most centrally located. There are Lanai rooms that are at one end, and then far away in the other direction is the West Tower. The rooms in the West Tower are bigger, away from everything else, and non-smoking.

The rooms that I saw didn't have safes or refrigerators but they did have coffee makers. There was noise from the nearby airport but I expected it to be worse than it was. The staff were uniformly friendly and smiling, but generally not helpful.

We drove down there anyway expecting to find another restaurant, but the restaurant that we wanted was happy to seat us right away. As with so many things, they might not have been responsible but it seemed like they had a hard time doing anything that was actually helpful.

I made the mistake of booking this hotel using one of those discount internet services. First and last time I'll do that again. I had put in a request for a 4-star accomodation thinking I would be given a reservation at either the Omni, Hyatt or Intercontinental hotel as shown in their example. But , no...it was the Sheraton Marina and Harbor instead. I was both surprised and disappointed. First of all, this property is NOT a 4-star accomodation, and this booking service should not be falsely advertising it as such. We arrived at almost 1am after a late flight. I had previously called the hotel to request a late arrival guarantee. Don't know if it was the late hour or the fact that I had booked through a discount broker, but the room we were given was on the ground floor. Not only did the noise of the airplanes from the nearby airport wake us up througout the night , but there was also heavy foot traffic outside our door in the busy hallway. One night , we had to listen to noisy teenagers out by the darkly lit pool area off our patio until midnight. Ditto on the self-parking situation. I think that $17 is ridiculous! (To valet park, it was $24 per day.) The lot was dirty, far away and very poorly lit. We were also double-charged by the hotel for the entire stay. Someone else with the same common last name must have gotten free parking! You had to give the lot attendant your room number along with your last name each time you left, so I'm not sure how the mistake kept getting made. Even as we left the lot for the last time, it happen again! Back to the front desk to clear it up. Lastly, the condition of the room was not that impressive. Certainly not 4-star standards. Ants in the bathroom and NEVER enough towels. Three out five nights I had to request (by note and phone) more towels and toiletries to the housekeeping staff. I reminded them that there were four in our party and not two. No newspaper on the first morning as well. San Diego and its weather was great however! The kids had a blast visiting all of the attractions. Also, note that there didn't seemed to be any reasonably priced restaurants on Harbor Island. A Von's grocery store was also a few miles away. Note there's no refrigerator or microwave in the room either. The location of the Sheraton worked for us, but the entire trip I felt deceived by the fact that I had basically stayed at a 3-star accomodation but thought I was paying for something much nicer. I guess in this situation the old adage, \"you get what you pay for\" holds true.

This hotel has two separate buildings, the east and west towers. When I checked in at the west tower, the clerk was uneducated in the hotel's computer system. As the west tower is the less busy of the two, there was no one to help him and we had to wait about 30 minutes to complete the check in. This would have been nothing more than an annoyance, but the check in was not correct. When we drove to the other building to go to our room, we discovered that our room was in the old section of the hotel, about a 1/4 of a mile walk through a maze of hallways in the hotel complex. I am not exaggerating. I counted steps. I booked my travel through Priceline as an experiment, a mistake that I never will repeat. This hotel was listed and promised as a 4 star hotel. The hotel clearly treats Priceline customers like second-class citizens, but Priceline does not warn you of this fact. When we finally arrived at out room, the carpet was dirty, not just worn, the bathroom was rusty, vents were missing from the closet doors and there was one bed, although the check in clerk had supposedly booked in two queens. The room was a step down from a Motel 8. To the bellhops credit, he switched our room to an \"upgraded\" room for free, and he at least tried to help. We moved rooms to the main tower and were greeted by dirty (stubbed out cigarettes) hallways and our room was again dingy with beaten up furniture, a desk that was literally falling apart, lamps that had no working bulbs, etc. After settling in and unable to find a floor vending machine for a bottle of water, I decided to pay the $ 4.00 for the hotel's room bottle, only to find that the bottle had been previously opened! Yuck! I called the front desk to assure that the water would not be charged to me, and she comped me another bottle, but the fact that the bottle was not checked should tell you the level of cleaning in the hotel. In addition to the gross room, and I swear to the big G on this, our toilet actually backed up. I believe that the hotel maintenance staff knew that there was a problem with the toilet before we checked in because the lid was not fully on the toilet when we got in the room.

After reading the review on Trip Advisor, I made sure to request a room in the newler West Tower. (It turned out to be the better choice since the conference was held in the same tower!). Here's a run-down of my experience: Shuttle - very prompt and efficient. The shuttle runs regularly between the 2 towers and the San Diego airport (5 minutes away). I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the shuttle also drives guests to nearby restaurants on the island and if not available, the bellboy will drive you in the hotel's fleet of Town Cars.

They, however, had my room ready and upgraded me to a larger deluxe room on a higher floor. Staff were very helpful and courteous. Room - paid $259 USD / night which included the buffet breakfast (more on this later). The room had 1 king bed, a sofa, and desk. The room was extremely spacious but the washroom was a little cramped. Room was spotless and had a balcony overlooking the harbour. Housekeeping came daily and was finished before 11am. West tower - newly renovated but while it was the farther tower from the airport, you could still hear the planes coming and going. The West Tower has only 1 restaurant and a small gym but it is much brighter and quieter than the East Tower. The East Tower is a mere 5 minute stroll along the marina or a 2 minute bus ride. Seriously, people who say the walk is long must not get much exercise! There is also free WiFi access in the hotel lobby but you must have your own wireless-equipped laptop to use (otherwise, head to the web bar in the lobby of the East Tower) Gym - very small but was never crowded. Equipped with 1 elliptical machine, 2 treadmills, 2 exercise bikes, free weights, and mats. Water cooler provided, too. Breakfast buffet - trek on over to the East Tower for the buffet. It's well worth the $$!! Plenty of fresh fruits, cereal, hot foods, and a made-to-order omlette bar.

The water in the room was $4.00 per bottle (if you drank it) $2.00 sodas, 19% add on plus $3.00 for every room service call, internet $13 dollars a day, parking (self parking) $16.00 a day and the onsite \"Bistro\" was ridiculously way over priced. The staff was cold, corporate and unhelpful (except for the bell boys... they were pleasant). We'll never come back to Sheraton/Starwood brand hotel again after this experience.

The other thing was there was no safe in the room...which I found to be odd. I normally like to place my valuables in the safe while I am visiting a city...it just makes easier for me. The room was facing the bay and it was definitely a beautiful view. We did not get to try any of the restaurants while staying here. The parking charge was ridiculous...$16 for self park and about $22 for valet..The one night they had a sweet sixteen and a weddding...therefore the self parking was full to capacity and the valet parking had a really looong wait. As for the airport noise, I did not hear even one while at the West Tower. However, the one afternoon we went to the East Tower and I noticed the airplane noise there. The front desk was helpful and friendly...but there was always a wait...I think they need to hire more people. It seemed as though the front desk was dealing with quite a few unhappy guests (one customer was being overcharged and another was a bride and groom who had made a reservation for five rooms and they messed up their reservations.) On our second night there, we had a problem with the bathtub...after showering, the water was not going down. We called the front desk and they sent someone up. After a half hour of using a wet vac to un-clog the tub (which caused the room to smell like a sewer from some reason), the man said it was fixed and that he would send someone up to clean the mess made in the bathroom from the wet-vac. My husband and I waited a half hour and then needed to call the front desk to find out where the cleaning service was (he still needed to shower as we were trying to make our dinner reservations), they assured us someone would be right up. We then waited another fifteen minutes...but there was still no cleaning service. Once again we called the front desk and they assured us someone was on there way...a few minutes later someone arrived to clean the bathroom. However, after my husband showered, the tub was clogged again. Since we did not want to go through what happened again, we asked for a new room for the next day.

We stayed in the West Tower and even with 2 children (we had a king room with a rollaway and a crib) were were comfortable and had ample room. Our room faced the bay which was the best free entertainment. My 2 year old had a blast letting us know anytime a helicopter or airplane took off from North Island or a large ship was passing by. We could also see the Coronado Bridge, downtown San Diego and Point Loma from our balcony. We were also treated to fireworks being setoff near the bridge a couple of nights. The hotel has 3 lovely pools, a small one at the West Tower (with bar/food service), the larger \"main\" pool and another small pool at the East Tower. The \"main\" pool has poolside dining with waitstaff service. The food was good although typicaly priced for hotel food. It arrived quick, hot and with a smile from the server who checked on us frequently to make sure things were good. They also accomodated substitutions for the ingredients (ie: chicken for shrimp on the salad). They also allow (and sell) pool toys which was great for my kids. The walk from the West Tower to the East Tower was pleasant, with beautiful views of the harbor. There's a great little deli (Papanani's) along the way which was open for breakfast, lunch and dinner until 8pm. They serve the best tasting ice cream! Also, another poster stated there wasn't a game room/arcade as advertised but there is one, tucked away off the \"main\" pool, near the spa entrance. The one downfall I found at this property was the $16 to self-park your car (you really need one, the hotel's not downtown or walking distance to public transportation) in the parking lot directly in front of the hotel.

A definite mixed bag. First, keep in mind that this property is really 2 different hotels about a quarter mile apart. The east wing is the larger hotel and the closest to the airport, and also the one with the most amenities. Very much a large convention property. The west wing (which the bellboy said used to be a Westin) is undergoing extensive renovation, or was when we were there. This was a problem for just about everybody -- guests, workers and hotel staff. At one point only one elevator was working, and much of the property was off-limits. To their credit, the hotel staff seemed to keep a positive and sympathetic attitude. Some guests seemed pretty put out. We actually didn't have a problem and since we were paying a discounted priceline rate, some of the irritants were easy to overlook. In fact, once the renovations are complete, this may be a better spot than the larger east wing. We loved our room with a great view of the bay and downtown San Diego. Cruise ships, yachts, fishing boats, kayakers...they all swept right by our balcony. Lots of joggers and walkers on the path by the bay too. The room was freshly remodeled... brand new, really...but not especially luxurious. Odd things were missing too -- like a lamp by the seating area (you couldn't read there at night) and the only mirror was in the bathroom. Pretty slim for a 4-star property. More like a 3-star.

I was on the 11th floor and every morning, we heard trucks loading and unloading supplies. They were errecting a tent and we heard every hammer and truck. Airport noise is almost non-existent but truck and motorcycle noise was constant. If you are seeking a view in this hotel, ask for side side facing downtown. More scenic and quiet. Parking is a nightmare. Key cards did not work for self parking. I attempted to enter lot late at night and key card did not open the gate. Several cars behind me caused a mini traffic jam while I had to reverse. Found a attendent to assist me. The lot is huge and very dark. Not safe for a woman alone to park a car alone. Paths to the hotel are not marked and we stumbled through bushes and a unexpected 5 foot drop trying to find a side walk. Valet parking, a $8.00 additional charge is almost a necessity. WE complained about parking at desk but clerk did not seemed concerned. No method to test key card until you try to park. To late! Internet is available for $13.25 per 24 hours. Wireless service not available. Outside eating opportunities are very limited. The pool in east tower is very nice and quiet. Overall, service is very good and employees will assist patrons. This is a convention hotel, not designed for families and tourists. The west tower would offer a better view of the bay. Not a four star hotel.

We stayed in the East Tower (the West tower looked nice, also). The hotel is situated on Harbor Island, where there is a marina with yachts, boats, and sailboats. We had two rooms, both were very clean and well-stocked with towels, soaps, shampoo, conditioner, coffee & creamer. It also had a hair dryer and an ironing board with iron. The beds were very comfortable. We had trouble figuring out how to set the alarm clocks, so we just dialed the automated \"wake-up\" call, which only took a few seconds. We also could not find any pens in the room to write postcards, but did find some next the the pay phones near the lobby. We also had some trouble with the air conditioning controls. The thermostat had a setting to run the fan low, medium, and high. We turned it on high, as we like the humming sound when we sleep. However, it would turn on for about 10 seconds, then shut back off. The room temperature was comfortable, but we couldn't get the fan to stay on. The hotel restaurants were somewhat pricey for us, considering we had children. They offered a breakfast buffet for $18.99 per person. Our children are too old to be offered the children's prices, but also not big enough to eat $18.99 worth of breakfast. Instead, we bought pastries and bagels from the cafe, and that ran about $20.00 total. There were only a few restaurants on Harbor Island, so bring a car or your walking shoes, because you may have to walk about 1 - 2 miles. Even though this hotel is very close to the airport, we didn't notice a lot of noise. Occassionally we would hear a plane flying by, but it wasn't very loud. It was actually a bonus, as we ate at a restaurant down the street late on evening, and the view of the planes flying over the bay was beautiful. The service we received at the check-in counter was average. We paid for our 2 rooms weeks before our trip (via check). However, their records didn't show our room as being prepaid, so they asked for our credit card. I was very concerned that they didn't show us paying $1400 and told them we had a cancelled check, but they didn't seem concerned or even try to help. They just wanted our credit card so they could check us in. After more discussions, I finally got the name and extension of a person in accounting to talk to. However, I could not get ahold of this person and left voice mail. The next day, I still had not heard anything, so I went to the check-in desk and found out it was taken care of. I think they could have at least called us and told us they fixed the accounting error, or apologized. But at that point I was happy that they agreed that we did indeed pay for our rooms already. The concierge was extremely helpful in helping us plan a sightseeing tour. She had very much information and was very knowledgeable. Since there is no beach on Harbor Island, we went swimming the the hotel's pool. However, the evenings were cool, and we didn't realize until the last night of our stay that there is a whirlpool just a little ways down from the outdoor pool. Once we found that, we spent the evening in there. The hotel also says they have a game room. However, all we saw was a couple ping-pong tables, and couldn't find the paddles or balls. We would stay at this hotel again, mostly for the beauty and the comfort.

The east tower has the updated standard room that you see at most sheratons. Small but modern furnishings with great beds/bedding. Great for business traveler.

Make sure that you do not get rooms on corner with trash dumpsters below. The noise no matter how high up you are will wake you up. For a more relaxed and leisurley stay, you might request the west tower. If you do make certain to request a renovated room. The rooms on floor 6 on airport was nice with view of harbor, and was charming. Do not (surprisingly enough) stay on the top level. Theses rooms are OUTDATED and musty. Beautiful skylights as you walk down the hallway with nice sconces on the walls but be prepared to better see the dirty stained carpeting. When you get off the elevator it is dark and the furnishings stained. In the rooms, you have a jetted tub but it is a very old model and I was frightened at what might be in the jets. Most requested rooms are the rooms with view of the navy pier. Less noise from airport. But stay higher up so that you do not get noise from parking lot or street. The fitness center was ok even though there was a fee but there is also a nice jogging trail around the dock. Beautiful. Good restaurants in both towers.

We are frequent travelers and have never been treated so badly. There is also tons of airplane noise as it is directly across from the airport and there is NOTHING within walking distance. You must park your car in their lot which will cost you $16/day for self-park, $22 for valet. My other complaint was that concierge recommended bad restaurants to us. In fact, we showed up at one and left as it was a total tourist trap. That really annoyed me. We informed them we were food lovers (we live in NYC and are used to great restaurants--not fancy necessarily---just great food) and we were sent to overpriced, bland places filled with travelers.

The room was SMALL (and I live in NYC where our standards in the space dept. are seriously below the nat'l average) and the air conditioning would turn off after literally 2 minutes and NEVER go back on unless you got up and pressed the button.

The patio had two sun lounge chairs, a glass top patio table with four chairs, two additional chairs with a small table, and a potted palm tree. The patio overlooked the wedding garden, pool, marina with boats on the right and across the water to the left was the military helicopter pads and ships. Across the water I saw a fireworks show one evening. The patio area was perfect for enjoying breakfast and the wonderful San Diego weather. When inside the room I didn't hear any airport noise. Rarely outside did I hear airplanes. The interior of the room had plush down comforters and pillows on both beds with soft sheets. The bathroom was large with marble floors, walls, and glass enclosed Jacuzzi tub and shower. The bathroom also had real plants. The sink counter area was large. I heard no noise from any other rooms, never even heard or saw another guest on my floor, though I know there must have been some, since housekeeping was cleaning rooms besides mine.

When we asked the fitness center attendant where we could change she treated us like we were'nt even guests.

It had a sliding door leading to a small balcony with a view of a good portion of the marina, and further away, downtown San Diego. We checked in at night and the view of the city lights was very nice. However, within a matter of minutes we were assaulted by the noise of airplanes taking off, seemingly directly over our room. The airplane noise decreased after 10 p.m. but during the night the air conditioning system made a loud metallic kicking noise when it turned on. The aiplanes returned at about 5 a.m. We could also hear a lot of motorcycle and other fast moving vehicle traffic from the street below. On our last night, we heard a child crying all night in the room next to ours. The self-parking is limited to those spaces farthest from the hotel; the spaces that are near the hotel are reserved for valet parking. The first night I had to hunt for about 10 minutes to find a parking space, and it was about 250 yards from the lobby. I found slightly closer parking spots for our second and third nights but they were still unacceptably far away. The continental breakfast is a buffet on the Penthouse level. Each day the selection was the same: nice pastries, bread for toasting, dry cereal in individual boxes, Yoplait yogurts, and fruit salad (watermelon, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, strawberries, pineapple, and a few blue berries). To drink, there is coffee, tea, milk and orange juice. There are about 10-12 tables, all of which have table clothes and a view of the marina. There were usually two waitresses, but their job is to clean up and keep the buffet stocked; they do not serve food. There are much better places to stay in San Diego. I have stayed in many hotels in San Diego, including the Sheraton's West Tower twice (it is better than the East Tower), and the Sheraton Suites (nice rooms but weird lobby and inconvenient loaction).

The convention center is not very far from the airport and there are many hotels near it. If you want to be able to walk to the beach, you need to choose a hotel in a different area of town. If you want to go to Sea World or the Zoo, there are also better places to stay.
