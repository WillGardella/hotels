Although we usually try and watch our budget for hotels, we were craving comfortable beds, well appointed rooms and convenience near the Gaslamp Quarter in downtown San Diego. You can't beat the closeness of this hotel to the Seaport Village and the trolley system. The hotel has a fantastic outdoor fire pit area on an upper floor where the pool is. We got a drink from the bar and went out there and enjoyed the evening views of the city skyline and the boats coming in for the night through the adjacent harbor. The views and setting were perfect for us to discuss our next travel plans to an exotic location outside of the U.S. If you do drive, the charge for parking is \"high\" for this hotel, but most other hotels in the general area also charge daily parking fees. They do have in and out privelages. This time we used the trolley to get around the city, including a ride to Old Town and the Zoo. The high price of the hotel of course results in superior appointments in the room and hotel. When you stay here, you feel like your in a royal palace with the stunning lobby. Will stay again when our budget allows.

Pros: - next to conference center - 5-10 minute walk to Gaslamp district - Not bad hotel restaurant (called Sally's) - if you get a room with a view the views are lovely - lovely lobby Cons: - completely unreliable wireless internet connection - service was spotty - breakfast prices were outrageous and no a la carte - rooms were somewhat run down Our experience here was negative for several reasons. First, we arrived at midnight due to a delayed flight, and despite having checked in using their on-line check-in service, they didn't have a room for us on arrival. They ended up finding a shoddy room for the first night that had a shower that sprayed all over the bathroom. They moved us the next night to an equally shoddy room (bathrooms especially need renovating), but with a working shower. In fairness, they did give us free breakfast the first day by way of apology (no small thing since the breakfasts are way overpriced). Second, the internet didn't work at all in the conference rooms or main areas outside the conference rooms. Many of the conference goers complained about the awful internet connections. In the rooms, the internet worked about 30% of the time, but was incredibly slow. Third, the blow dryers didn't work in either of the rooms. Each time I had to call down for a new blow dryer (not ideal when you are rushing to make a conference session on time). Fourth, one night our neighbors threw a loud party that woke us up at 2am. We called down and complained, and they sent someone up. The music stopped but the yelling continued. We had to call again before they sent someone up to shut it down completely (which they did). Fifth, the breakfast is broken down into three types of buffets and you had to keep track of what was included in what buffet (e.g., cheese and salmon was not included in one of them but was in the other two). They kept the food all in the same area so you just had to work out what you could eat depending on which exorbitant price you wanted to spend. Sixth, we asked the concierge to book a restaurant for us and they talked us out of the restaurant we had researched on-line, and promised a better experience somewhere else. They gave us a card promising a free appetizer at this other restaurant. The food at the restaurant they sent us to was terrible, and it was likely that the hotel had some sort of deal with restaurant to send over customers. There are lots of hotels along the waterfront. I'd recommend considering another one instead of this one.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lafayette, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat on the surface, but...\u201d", "Author": "MeghanAnnRose", "ReviewID": "UR129060655", "Content": "I was at the Manchester Grand for a conference and stayed there as well.

We were told it was going to be $179 for each night, but we informed them that we needed something with a kitchen. They said they had something with a kitchen for $200 so we immediately decided this was a great deal and booked it. We got to the hotel late in the evening with a toddler and an infant. We valet parked the car and had the bell desk take our luggage. When my husband went to check us in, he was told that the room was actually $179 plus $200 for the kitchen. We were disappointed, but since it was late we decided to stay anyways. When we got to the room it was horrible! The room was so outdated and the kitchen was nothing more than an old refrigerator, a small sink, and some old cabinets. There were no dishes, utensils, or dish soap. Then we went into the bedroom and looked around. It seemed okay until we saw the bathroom. They had put us in a wheelchair accessible room, which meant that there was no tub in the bathroom. It also meant that safety features, such as locks, were now accessible to my toddler. We wanted to leave so badly, but since it was so late and the kids were so tired we decided to stay for at least one night. The next morning we checked out and told the person at the front desk about our experience. He was very apologetic and tried very hard to remedy the situation. He offered us a different room, but ultimately we decided to look elsewhere. We were told that they would be remodeling the hotel this week, but in my opinion they should not have let anyone stay there. I felt like it was a last ditch effort to get some money before the remodel. The experience at this hotel ruined our time in San Diego. Instead of sightseeing the next morning, we were busy looking for another hotel and waiting for their check in time.

But I know that not every nook and cranny can be checked after every visitor. It was just unexpected. Another is how confusing the hotel was. If you are only staying there for the room then you should have no problem but we were there for a conference and had to go from tower to tower.

Also there are 2 sets of elevators, 1 is for floors from the lobby to about the 24th floor and the other is from the 25th to the top, the second blasts past the first 24 floors, so make sure you get on the correct elevator.

This year and last, I called to receive a conference rate and was told there were none available (even though others who called after me did receive it) so I reserved at a standard (discount) rate. Before I boarded my flight to CA, I used their online system to check in to the hotel since I'd be arriving late in the evening. I received an email confirming my check in: \"your room is ready.\" But when I arrived tired and ready to relax, I was instead told that I had been checked out of my room and there was no availability for me that night. Instead they put me up in another hotel that was nearly 30 minutes away. Granted, it was the historic Del Coronado which was very nice and they provided taxi vouchers in both directions, but I honestly just wanted to get settled in the place I was intending to stay for the duration.

In terms of location, it is a 7-10 minute walk down West Harbor Dr. to the Convention Center, and a 10 minute walk up Market St. to Horton Plaza and all the restaurants around that area. Little Italy was a 15 minute walk up Kettner. The hotel sits directly on the harbor, where there is a great walkway for running, biking, walking, etc. Very flat and pretty views.

Go to the bar on the 40th floor for a spectacular view of the area, but then walk over to 4th or 5th or up to Little Italy for more afforable, more creative food.

I stayed several days at this hotel for a conference. What stands out most about this hotel is the staff. I have never been treated so courteously and felt so welcomed by hotel staff at all levels as here: desk clerks, bell hops, bar staff, and maids. I do not think the rooms are particularly special, but they are pleasant enough and well maintained. Full breakfast buffet was $25; cereal bar $17, as I recall. The buffet was very nice, but I think too pricey especially if you are not going to pigout at a buffet. I would like to have had the option of ordering a small breakfast from a menu (not available), but wait staff was very amenable and let me know omelets from the buffet were $8 and each side or beverage thereafter was $4, so I was able to have a nice breakfast for $12. There is a pickup sandwich/breakfast shop. Also just outside the hotel on the marina are many restaurants a short walk away. The h'ordeurves and dinner catered by the hotel for the conference were very good, especially the h'ordeurves. The location of the hotel was also very convenient to shops, the Gaslamp district, the convention center, and the aircraft carrier museum. Concierge was extremely helpful during my stay. What did I miss? There was no complimentary hotel shuttle to and from the airport, which seemed odd to me. Also not much convenient public transportation to the museums and zoo that I could see.

Although the hotel is only about a block away (the Mariott is between the Hyatt and the Convention Center) this particular conference was in the hotel itself. It is a massive property comprised of two towers with a 4 story conference/meeting/activities center joining the two towers. The pool area on the the roof of the 3rd story (4th floor access) was lovely, but the temperatures were a little cool for my taste, so I never actually got in the pool. It's handy because the workout facility is also on the 4th floor (Seaport Tower) adjacent to the pool. Although I typically request a King room, settling for a double-room this time allowed me to check in at 11:00 am versus 4:00 pm. It was a very nice corner room on the 25th floor( 2585) offered views of the both the bay and the City. There was quite a bit of open floor space despite the two beds and a couch. In fact, it was more than enough to allow for my floor exercises and stretches. All of the furnishings appears to be in either \"like new or new\" condition, including the carpeting, and the TV was a mammoth 50 or 52\" flat panel. I also had an in-room frig where I stored my waters, sodas, yogurt and fruit...yay! I also appreciated the full-sized blow dryer in the bathroom -- versus the typical, wimpy, attached-to-the-wall version. You also get tubes of Aquafresh toothpaste along with the typical shampoo, conditioner, and lotion ammenities. Nice touch. I also L-O-V-E-D that the windows opened to allow fresh air, although I was quickly reminded that all of the hotels in this area are also adjacent to the train tracks and there are very noisy freight trains that go through the intersections blowing their air horns in the wee hours of the morning. Be sure to bring your earplugs or close the windows before turning in for the night! The hotel is also immediately adjacent to Seaport Village, which provides lots of opportunity for dining and shopping. They don't currently have a \"convenience/sundry\" shop in the hotel. There is a sign indicating that new retail shops are \"coming soon,\" but they were selling some sundry-type items (water, soda, snacks, personal needs items) in the little breakfast/lunch shop in the base of the Seaport Tower next to Redfield's Sports Bar. BEWARE: I drank the two sodas I bought from a CVS Pharmacy in the Gas Lamp District and had to pay $3.25 for a Diet Coke from this very same sundry area. Everything was very clean and well maintained. You can pick up a free wi-fi signal IN the meeting rooms, but otherwise, have to pay to use the hotel's wireless and wired Internet ($12+ per day).

When I did not answer the door right away, the woman came into the room to wake me up. This seemed odd and was definitely not appreciated as I had not even requested a wake up call. The other negative thing about the hotel was the cost of parking. I think it is probably comparative to parking in this area, but still seemed steep. It was $27.00/day.

There is not a bad view in the place, and the rooftop pool is great. However I did have a few bad experiences while staying here last september. First off, the fact that there is no free wifi in rooms in this day and age is ridiculous. The rates are high enough where that should be offered without question. Upon arrival we were given key cards that well, really didn't work. I am a pretty patient guy, and was there on vacation so I tried to make it work, but these key cards really just didnt work. We were issued new cards once, and then twice, and then after coming back to the hotel late they didn't work again. Went back down to the front office, and they sent somebody up to \"fix\" the door lock. The next morning it still didnt work. Talked to management and they moved our room and waived the steep $25 dollar a day parking fee. Inconvenienced yes, but they made it right. In the middle of our trip I checked my bank balance, and the hotel had sent through two random charges to my card for $96 and $154. It wasn't the room costs or a deposit, and I ,had ordered no room service etc. No one could tell me why the charges were there. Thankfully an employee at the front desk named Vincent made it right. He seemed to care, and he spent a good amount of time talking to the billing department and even called my bank to get the charges reversed. If it wasn't for his customer service this would be a one star review because I was upset at this point. Front desk guy Vincent and Front end Manager Chris should get commended for their customer service. Everyone else seemed incompetent. Im not much of a review writer but I expect that when $300 a night is spent on a hotel, it should be a flawless experience.

But what really sets it apart is the level of service. As I was about to catch a taxi to the zoo, the bell captain suggested I buy my zoo tickets from the concierge to avoid the long ticket lines at the zoo. The concierge not only sold me the tickets, but gave us valuable tips about visiting the zoo. Then the taxi hailer suggested I use the hotel car (a Denali) to get to the zoo for little more than what the taxi costs. The hotel car driver was exceptionally personable and made the drive over very pleasant. He even showed us where to find a taxi back and gave me his card should I need his service again. I did use him again to get to the airport. The concierge also gave us great recommendations on restaurants in Seaport Village, only 50 feet out the back door of the hotel. The Hyatt public areas are impressive. The lobby is huge. It has a nice little coffee shop where you can also get drinks and pastries. Redfields is a nice sports bar in the lobby. I did not use the pool or fitness center but they both looked very nice. The room was very good. The beds have comfortable pillowtops. We had a mini-fridge with no overpriced minibar drinks or snacks. The window opens for fresh air, but not so far as to present a danger to children falling out. They also do a good job of keeping the room quiet but you can still hear the train horns from the track less than 100 feet out the front door. What a place for a train track. The flatscreen TV was huge, the largest I've ever seen in a hotel, although the channel selection was a bit less than I am used to. There were only four small drawers in the dresser, but the closet was good size for overflow. The bathroom had great shower pressure. The bathroom amenities were quite nice except for the toilet paper which is ridiculously thin. The only drawback was there was no chair for sitting, just a desk chair. There was room by the window for a chair, but it would have been tight. They designed the room just a bit too small. Room service is very expensive and the water bottles in the room cost $5, so be forewarned. We also took advantage of the Hertz car rental desk in the lobby. That saved us from having to park a rental car at $26/day. The hotel is in a great location, less than 100 yards from San Diego Bay. We had great views from our room. Seaport Village is a very pleasant place to stroll even if the shops are overly touristy and do not really have anything I wanted to buy. Beyond Seaport Village is a nice park to walk around, surrounded on three sides by the bay, and looking out at Coronado. Downtown and the Gaslamp District are a short walk away, and there is a trolley stop within a block.

That being said, the hotel is outstanding. Very modern and so clean. Checking in is a breeze (if your a Platinum or Diamond member with Hyatt you have your own check in area) as I am a Diamond member. The rooms are oustanding and the views are incredible. Every room has some sort of view of the harbor and/or city. The rooms are very modern and spacious. The beds are the most comfortable ones around it is even hard to get up in the morning. The pool area is great and inviting. The service is impeccable, every one of the staff members goes out of their way to assist you and make your stay most memorable. The restaurant choices are all good too and the Top of the Hyatt bar and lounge on the 40th floor is a view to die for. You must have a drink there. When issues come up sometimes during our stays, they were fixed promptly and it was made right. Example went to the Grand Club to get a snack, but since they were extremely busy no items left in the club, so I told the front desk and presto the items I wanted were delivered to my room free of charge. It is those extra things that count. In seeing some of the other reviews, I don't know what happened during their stays, but if you are not happy speak to someone in charge to make it right.

There were two issues with the room. The first was that the toilet ran constantly. They did fix this issue with just one call. The second issue was that the electric socket above the bathroom sink would not hold anything that was plugged into it securely thus the device (such as an electric razor) would work intermittently. I called several times to see if they could either fix or replace the socket (which costs less that $5 at most hardware stores). It was never fixed nor was there ever a call back or message left as to why it was not fixed. After three calls, I gave up and used my razor from another socket. This was difficult since all other sockets in the room were at a lower level on the wall and the razor has a short cord. The hotel is quite a ways from the Gaslamp Quarter and their parking garage charges $26 a day for parking. So, we parked only the first night at the hotel. We parked in an ACE parking lot nearby for $10 a day from that point forward. However we were charged $130 for parking by the hotel when we checked out which was remedied by the hotel. They should not have assumed that we would park each day when we only charged one day of parking to the room. I've stayed at the Mancherster Grand Hayatt many times over the past 10 years.

We travel to San Diego reguarly, perhaps making 3-4 trips per year and this hotel would probably be our least favorite of the ones we've visited. general observations are that due to this hotel being huge (2 huge towers) it feels impersonal, it has also changed ownership and new management is not on the ball. location- the manchester is downtown but removed from the gaslamp quarter where all the action is but still walkable. service- We found that several members of the staff were rude and not helpful. this is by no means a reflection on the entire staff as some of the club lounge servers and concierge went out of their way to be accomodating, but the few rude individuals such as the front desk clerk who checked us in left a bad first impression cleanliness- this is a very big hotel which , however we found that the overall cleanliness and attention to detail was sloppy. for example on our first day we noticed a cigarette butt in the corner of the hallway on our floor. a few hours later we returned only to find it still there. the next morning it was still there. we pushed it into the middle of the hallway to see if they would finally see it; about a day and a half later it was finally cleaned up. i have the impression that very few rounds are made by the staff due to lax management. restaurants- definently try Lael's buffet for breakfast, the selection is huge and the quality is very good except for the sushi which tasted dry. Sally's has a nice atmosphere and the sushi is very good, make sure you try their cream cheese roll. rooms- the rooms were advertised as renovated but just when they were renovated would be interesting to find out. It looks as though just the wallpaper was changed and that itself was ugly and outdated. The rooms and the hallways looked tired and dated, the carpets faded, the bathrooms old with cracked and yellowing tubs and sinks. there were never enough towels, we had to keep on calling housekeeping. None of the little toiletries like lotion or shower cap were provided, we had to call for those. The view was average; mostly of buildings with peek-a-boo water views. beds were small and lumpy. smelled musty. pets- very dog friendly (yay!) club lounge- way to small for the number of rooms it was supposed to serve, overcrowded. it was a pain to find seating in the morning. also understaffed, the poor servers were sweating trying to clear tables. value- this was the part that bothered us the most. this hotel nickel and dimes you for everything. self-parking is $26/day, if you want to have a package/parcel sent to the hotel they will charge you a $10 service fee to receive it for you. wifi is $10/day if you want it in your room, it is free in the lobby but the connection is terrible as can be seen by the people walking around the lobby with their phones and ipads in the air trying to hook onto the network. all in all there are better options: if you're looking to be in the middle of the action and want to enjoy the San Diego nightlife go to the Andaz (formerly the Ivy.) its part of the Hyatt umbrella now and is their trendy boutique line. iwifi there is free, valet-parking is $12/day, some of the mini-bar items are free and you get free access to the rooftop pool/bar which is the place to be during the weekend and hard to get into. its in the middle of the gas-lamp quarter which is where all the nightlife is. if you're traveling with family/kids and don't mind driving try the Loews on Coronado.

After working for Hyatt Hotels for 15 years I am a bit of a hotel \"snob\" so take some of my pickiness with a grain of salt. In addition, this was a buisness trip that didn't allow me to use, explore or appreciate all of the facitities at the hotel so my reivew will reflect that perspective. Checked in arond 1pm to a well staffed front desk in a beautiful lobby. The desk clerk was efficient and helpful and gave me all the information that I needed and I was on my way. There are two towers in the hotel, Harbor Tower (older tower) and the Sea[something] tower (newer tower). From comments that I heard from fellow meeting goers, the Sea[something] tower rooms were a bit nicer and more up-to-date. The room itself was very spacious with nice dark wood funiture that included a big desk (w/outlet) end tables, dresser and a chair ottoman combo. The dresser contained a room safe, fridge (no mini bar) and three drawers on the smaller side, two phones, iHome clock radio, wired and wireless internet connections. Both we complimentary for me but that could have been a meeting perk. Big 42\" flat screen with usable computer monitor and HDMI connections. Hair dryer and magnifying mirror in the bathroom. The carpet looked relatively new. No balcony rooms from what I can see. My room had a decent view of the opposite tower, with downtown to my left and the harbor to my right. The bed was decent but not the most confortable I've ever been in. The pillows did not appear to be feather but seemed to stuffed with some kind of chunky synthetic filling. The conforter was a bit thin as well. The bed was well worn on one side but quite firm and more comfortable on the other side. General hotel bed tip - if you like a firmer mattress, always sleep on the side of the bed opposite the alarm clock. Most people will sleep on the alarm clock side and it will wear down quicker. The bathroom was simple but clean and in good shape. OK counter space. The tub/shower was a bit on the small side and did not have a bowed shower curtain as I've seen in other hotels. The shower pressure itself would make Karen Silkwood proud. Shower pressure is a real hot button of mine but I can say this is the first hotel where I would have liked to turn it down a bit. I did feel better though knowing I started each day here radiation free. :-) Location, location, location. The hotel couldn't be better situated. About a 5-10 minute walk from the Gaslamp Quarter and Petco Park (Baseball/Padres). Tons of shopping and a restaurant for any type of food you can imagine. Nice place to just walk around as well. In addition, there is the Seaport Village directly behind the hotel. More shopping and restaurants that is literally two minutes from the building. The train tracks are near by and you can hear the train whistle on a fairly regular basis from both the light rail and Amtrack style trains. It didn't bother me much but I could see how some folks could get a little bonkers from it although they do seem to stop running by 11pm or midnight. I didn't swim but the pool looked well kept but small. The do run three good sized fire pits at night in the pool area. That's about all can speak to. Overall it was a very nice stay but did not live up to the image I had in my mine when I heard it was a Grand Hyatt (a title Hyatt usually reserves for their more spectacular hotels). I would stay here again for business without hesitation but would at least investigate other options if I was bringing the family back for a vacation.

It's slow period for this property so I got a very reasonable rate and a free upgrade to a higher-floor room. The view from my 28th floor room in the south tower was one of the best I've ever had in any hotel I've stayed at. I could view the harbor, downtown, and even view airplanes landing at the airport. The room itself was clean, modern and spacious. The bathroom was very clean, although maybe slightly dated by today's standards, but nothing that bothered me. It didn't bother me much, but travelers that get distracted by noise may be bothered by commuter rail sounds (San Diego Trolley, Coaster, Amtrak and crossing gate noises). The trains are constant from before the sun rises to very late in the evening. If you're bothered by this, try to ask for a higher room facing the ocean, and not facing Shoreline Drive. The location is very convenient. You can walk to the Gaslamp District, Downtown and many tourist spots along the harbor. The trolley across the street can take you to other places (Old Town, Tijuana, etc.). If you plan on visiting Balboa Park/San Diego Zoo, you'll need to inquire about transportation to get there if you don't have a car. The only gripes I have (which has been mentioned in other posts) is the high cost for parking ($26 a day) and internet (about $13 a day). They say they have special packages for these services, but they don't save much. But in all, there's nothing wrong with this hotel.

I am looking forward to the updates in 2012 as the rooms/suites and conference rooms are clearly out of date. (The tv's are huge now - but wireless is HORRIBLE!) I did make a complaint to housekeeping as the double bed linens don't actually fit the beds - which results in 1/3 of the bed being without sheets covering the mattress pad. They immediately responded and were incredibly customer service focused (kudos!) The folks at Redfields (one of the bars) are terrific - food is good and service is great.

So, expect to spend this $$$. We were given a room at 23rd floor. The room was clean and nice. The only thing we have to call the front desk for was the sink was draining very slow. I have to call front desk twice before the problem was fixed. The room was quiet except you do hear freight train passing by around mid night and sounded the honk. It is a common issue for hotels around the area (Hyatt, Marriott, Hilton). We got the view to the sound side of the town. So, there is nothing much to see. One thing to watch for is the door. You could accidentally slam the door since there is no tensioner to slow down the door when you close it. We have heard this from other rooms as well and it could become annoying if you start hearing this too many times. Hope Hyatt could address this issue.

It is also very convenient to the San Diego Convention Center. The hotel lobby is magnificent with lots of marble and high ceilings. There are two towers, with different shops and restaurants in each. Overnight parking (self-service) was $26 per night. But this was offset by the fact that we had a full breakfast buffet (normally $25 per person) included in the room rate, which was reasonable. We had a king-sized room with a view overlooking the pool, and beyond, San Diego Bay. Room was comfortable, with a big screen HDTV and a mini-fridge. I had a few problems with the bathroom. There was some paint chipping off the bathroom door, and the bathroom itself could have used a bit of an update. We had some problems with the wi-fi connection (which costs $9.95 per 24-hours) but when we complained to the hotel desk, they waived the charge for our entire stay. The desk staff seemed very committed to making things right whenever possible. Overall, we enjoyed our stay very much. I'd recommend this hotel if you need to be near the Convention Center, the seaport, or the Gaslamp Quarter.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Springs, California", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful grounds at the marina.\u201d", "Author": "DesertFoodies", "ReviewID": "UR121643748", "Content": "We stayed over Thanksgiving weekend.

I'll just sort my thoughts into pros and cons. Pros: - Location. It's two doors down from the convention center, and you can walk to all the Gaslamp District restaurants and bars. - Service. The staff were all very nice, from check-in to check-out. I'm Gold Passport Platinum, and I got an upgrade certificate in the mail the day before I left. While they couldn't accommodate me in a Grand Club room, they gave me a great room on the 22nd floor of the new tower and Grand Club privileges. - The Grand Club lounge was nice, and I grabbed a snack and a drink a couple of times. Very standard, nothing particularly nice or bad here. - The lobby is quite impressive. - They gave me a 1 PM late checkout, even though they were full. - The health club was nice, though full, and the hot tub was a great way to relax after a workout. - The beds are very nice, whatever Hyatt's version of the Westin \"Heavenly Bed\" is. I slept quite well, though these are available at any Hyatt property. - The view is great, from a high floor. Views of the harbor and downtown. - Amenities were standard -- LCD TV with a decent selection of channels, strong but not-so-fast internet, fridge, etc. - Self-parking, which is preferable to valet parking IMHO. There is a valet option, but I hate waiting for a car. Cons: - When the hotel was full, as it was during my stay, it seems really crowded. The elevators take several minutes to go down, the health club gets overcrowded, the pool area is full, etc. It makes the place feel like a bit of a factory. - The room, even a king bed room, was relatively small. - The walls are thin. I was using the bathroom and thought I heard the phone ring, but it was actually the phone in the room next door. I had no noise problems, but noisy neighbors would have been heard here. - The decor and furniture were somewhat dated, honestly. They say they'll be renovating, and I hope it looks much nicer when they are done. - The bathtub was small and the shower not quite tall enough. Do they not get enough 6'2 business travelers to warrant raising the shower head? - I checked in with my boyfriend and got the cock-eyed look and question, \"Is one king bed OK?\" Well, I'm entitled to a confirmed bed upon reservation (thanks GP Platinum), and I reserved a king-sized bed. Why wouldn't it be OK? I don't take it as anti-gay or whatever, I just know I wouldn't have been asked that question had we been a straight couple.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWOW!!\u201d", "Author": "romaroma_x", "ReviewID": "UR121446813", "Content": "I am amazed by the Manchester Grand Hyatt - I was immediately wow'ed by the high ceilings of the lobby and general huge size of the hotel.

So convenient. Staff was courteous and we were treated very well during out stay. We used the spa and had a great experience there, I highly recommend it! Our room faced Coronado and Seaport Village and was just a gorgeous view, especially at night. The room was a bit on the small side but probably average for a hotel room in the city, very well appointed, and I always appreciate decent water pressure when you're on the 31st floor! We stayed 5 nights and received complimentary wi-fi which was sincerely appreciated. The big bonus of this hotel is location. We wanted to see as much as we could during our stay. Within walking distance is the heart of the Gaslamp District, USS Midway, Broadway Pier, Seaport Village, the trolley tour, bus stop, convention center, Petco Park. It was great to walk along the paths close to the hotel and have so many attractions close by. Hint: if you're going to La Jolla - skip the $100 taxi cab roundtrip and take the city bus for $5 during the weekend. Bus is lightly traveled and the route seemed to be very safe. At the Hyatt, we had appetizers at Redfield's which was okay. Was as expected. We also ate at Sally's and while it was not outstanding, it had a great vibe, staff was attentive and had a nice menu. The business center came in handy several times to print out trolley tickets, bus routes, etc. Extended hours would also be helpful. The kiosks were also nice in other locations of the hotel to print out boarding passes. And another perk, considering the number of rooms at the hotel and being on one of the top floors, we hardly had to wait at all for an elevator and they were very fast. Kudos to the hotel for the that! Also the frig in the room was an added bonus, especially for an extended stay. Next time I come back to San Diego I would definitely stay here.

FYI for business travelers, they have hard to find rates, especially for downtown San Diego. That was its first bonus point for me. I could not find rates like this at the Marriott, Hilton, or any other downtown hotel. I was told these rates are guaranteed at ANY Hyatt. Good to know. Secondly, the rooms are sparkling clean, the beds are comfortable, the view was spectacular, I had no problems with the bathroom (everything worked fine for me), and I slept like a baby. Although I did not manage to get to the pools, there are two, and there are also two hot tubs - both with amazing views of the bay. There's also a fire pit on level four, between the hot tubs, which is nice to sit at in the evening. The gym looked amazing and had numerous treadmills, stairmasters, ellipticals, free weights, and machines. I was very impressed with the staff, all of whom were friendly and accomodating. Upon arrival in my room (after a long day of travel), I found that it smelled like smoke. When I called the front desk, I was immediately given another room with no problem. The second room was much better, and the staff called me to double check it was okay. Check out was painless and quick. The location cannot be beat. The Manchester Grand Hyatt is seated at the bottom of downtown right next to Seaport Village. In fact, if you go out the back door of the hotel, you can immediately enter Seaport Village. You can easily walk to a number of popular areas in downtown. The hotel is only four blocks from the Gaslamp district and the USS Midway and 10 blocks from Little Italy and Petco Park. Because of this proximity, you have easy access to numerous restaurants, bars, and attractions. There is an attached parking garage, which is also useful. It's very easy to get in and out of the garage, and the entrance to Interstate 5 is only 5-7 minutes away, depending on traffic. I did take the opportunity to dine at both Sally's on the Water and the sports bar downstairs (Redfield's). The food was wonderful, but FYI, the prices are a little steep.

If you do - check, re-check, then check your bill again. They stole an extra night's room stay by overcharging our account. AND THEY HAVE DRAGGED THEIR HEELS IN PROVIDING REIMBURSEMENT. Nearly three months later, this has still not been resolved. We were allocated the Hyatt through the ComicCon hotel allocation through Travel Planners. In this transaction, TP charged one night's stay (in May '11) When we checked in, the check-in desk representative found the reservation and assured us that all was well. When we checked out, we found our bill was several hundred dollars higher than expected. We questioned this with the first desk representative found no record of the first night as having been paid. When we pressed, a manager was called in. She also found no record. I then provided my paid receipt from Travel Planners. She said that that was not proof - I would need to provide a copy of my bank transaction to prove that it had been paid. WTF??? Without that said proof, the Hyatt would not refund. Returning home, we immediately contacted Travel Planners and started the appeal process. Several emails and phone calls ensued. TP provided all the required financial transactions, showing that we had indeed paid for our hotel stay. Come to find out, there were likely hundreds of Comic Con customers who had been overcharged by the Hyatt due to their inept bookkeeping. All the funds had been sent from Travel Planners but somehow, they had gone missing on the Hyatt's end. No apologies offered from the Hyatt. None whatsoever. What abysmal customer service. The Hyatt came up with an absolutely idiotic solution - they would provide reimbursement to Travel Planners and told Travel Planners that it would then be their responsibility to provide our reimbursement. Again... WTF??? So, it's now October and no $$$ have been returned. I am giving it until the end of this week before starting THEFT litigation.

They have special kiosks to print your boarding pass free of charge, but we were a bit disappointed that you had to pay to use their computers for internet purposes. With the price paid, I think that should be complimentary. The other disappointment was that there were two afternoons, they required you left the 4th floor pool in order for them to accommodate a private party. A guest really doesn't want to hear that after paying what we did. However, I will say they directed you to the 3rd floor pool in the other tower.

There are no balconies, so you cannot fully enjoy the seaside experience anyway. I would definitely request a room overlooking the Coronado Bridge side next time - our room faced the other side, 24th floor. \"Wireless\" internet service is spotty - so if it is important to you to have a good reliable connection, request a room close to the \"antenna\" (I cannot stress this enough if you need a connection) - we had to move after the first night, as the signal in our room (about halfway down the hall) was very poor.

After a long transatlantic flight via LAX, I arrived early evening and check-in was swift. Within 5 minutes of pulling up to the hotel in a cab, I was in my room on the 34th floor unpacking my case while taking in the sumptuous views over the harbour and the Coronado bridge. The room was your standard Hyatt-style room complete with king size bed, bathroom and work area. The room was clean, the bed comfy, the TV perfect and the free coffee delicious. The bathroom was of a good size if not a little spartan but I am such a fan of their white ginger shampoo and conditioner that I can forgive them the little things. I stayed four nights in total and had breakfast delivered to my room every morning as I could not face the buffet breakfast that is served in Lael's on the ground floor. Years ago Lael's used to be an a la carte breakfast type place but the powers that be changed it into a buffet one and personally the sight of mounds of pre-cooked bacon, sausage links as well as fruit puts me right off first thing in the morning. Room service was swift but I take exception to the canny way in which a $18 omelette can suddenly morph into a $30 check once service charge, tray charge, gratuities and taxes are loaded onto the bill. And then the server expects you to add a further tip. So here's a tip from me, just be careful when ordering your breakfast on the phone as the agent will upsell you like crazy - or at least try to. There are tons of rooms at this hotel, so now and again it can feel a little impersonal. The gym was in the other tower (the seaport one - I stayed in the harbour tower), so every morning I went for a my little walk down my corridor to the elevator, down to the 4th floor and then across from one tower to the other passing the hotel pool. The gym is very good and most of the cardio machines look out over the harbour towards the navy base. I saw two massive navy ships come in and leave port over the course of the 4 days I was there. The hotel bar is in the harbour tower to the left of the front desk area and again, because of the sheer size of the hotel, it does feel a little impersonal. I had some of my business meetings there both in the daytime and in the evening and the atmosphere lacked a little. It often felt like you were sitting at a bar in a shopping mall with the sheer amount of folks passing by. There is a bar on the top floor of the harbour tower but I gave that a miss this time. All in all, I do enjoy the MGH, and for business trips it certainly ticks all the boxes.

Besides, if you want a spectacular view, go up to the lounge on the top floor of the hotel for a drink, you won't want to leave!

You can get on and off as many times as you please. Don't miss Coronado Island! The Trolley stops there, as well as Balboa Park, Little Italy, Old Towne, and other great places. If you rent a car, make sure you drive out to Point Loma, which is about 20 minutes away. The views of the San Diego skyline on one side, and the Pacific on the other, are asolutely breathtaking! A couple of things to keep in mind: parking is quite expensive at this hotel, so if you are not going to use your car every day, I suggest you rent it for just the days you plan to use it. Also, I don't understand why in this day and age, so many hotels continue to charge for internet service. It's like charging for tap water. Oh well, that is one of my pet peeves.

The location of the Hyatt is in the heart of Seaport Village, a fun place to walk right outside the backdoor of the hotel with small shops and tasty treats. The views of the bay from the hotel are panoramic and interesting. Looking south toward the city, Coronado bridge and Mexico; or north toward the military base, the aircraft carrier and cruise ships, and Point Loma. Depending on the time of the year that you visit, the area activities can vary and do impact the experience. The weekend of a game at Petco Stadium can be a crowded time, but also holidays and certain conferences. This is a popular conference hotel with large meeting facilities and adjacency to the San Diego Convention Center a few yards down the path. Events vary so ask the hotel staff what is going on when you are booking your trip. We have stayed during several conferences including a bridge tournament, a financial advisors meeting and a religious youth conference: all very different. Ask about hotel and local events before you book. The hotel is also walking distance to the parks around the boat harbor. On this trip, there was a concert at the park with fireworks afterwards. On the same night, there was a game at Petco stadium that ended with fireworks. We saw two fireworks shows from our room in the same night (think: LOUD, but fun). Also loud are the trains that run in front of the hotel, including the alarm clanging at the crossings when the trollies pass. Fortunately, the trains and alarms do not run all night, but they would prevent you from taking an afternoon nap if you were a light sleeper. If you are looking for a quiet getaway, it would be difficult to find in downtown San Diego with its big city sounds. Try the Hotel Del Coronado for a beachfront experience. The main pool is on a very large deck with outdoor areas for families with children. There is also an adult pool, Kin Oasis, for guests who are 21 years or older. The adult pool is next to the spa. The spa is a great place for a massage, hair or nail service, but you may want to ask about any booked events at the Kin Oasis pool if you want a quiet spa experience. The adult pool is no longer part of the spa and operates as a bar with food service. There are two cabanas available for rent as sitting areas for cocktails, not for typical relaxing by the pool in a chaise lounge chair. The lack of sun protection options for the adult pool is a disappointment. The family pool on the main deck has several cabanas for relaxing by the pool. We book a AAA package to include full breakfast at Lael's, a significant value. The buffet is large and includes fruits, nuts, pastries, traditional hot breakfast items, waffles and an omelet station. Eat all you want and then go for a walk along the water to work off the calories. One major change was the sale of the property in March, 2011. The Manchester family sold the hotel to a group of investors. We observed no significant differences during our stay. There was live jazz in the hotel's lounge area on Friday night. We had never seen this before and may be something new (but not sure). The hotel does sell out and does overbook rooms. If you are the victim of overbooking, we were told that the Hyatt pays for your accommodations at another hotel. This has never happened to us, but we usually arrive early in the afternoon. The hotel has two large towers and we have stayed in both. No significant differences except maybe the content of the views. The newer tower has end rooms with windows facing Coronado island. We stayed in one of these rooms one weekend and it was a nice feature, but not a necessity. The hotel is also walking distance to the Gaslamp district with great restaurant and night life choices. Ask the concierge for recommendations and bring good walking shoes. There are also pedi-cabs that will offer you a ride. The pedal pumpers charge about $12-15 for a distance that you could walk in about 10-15 minutes. We rode one once because it was warmer than walking on a cold night. The night temps do cool down in San Diego, even in the summer, so bring a light jacket or sweater for evenings. Our room was a bit musty on this stay, but the air conditioning worked well and we opened the room's window for some fresh air.

My original reservation was split into two requiring me to switch rooms in the middle because of a lack of availability. When I checked in, the front desk lady just shook her head, made a comment about \"why do they do this?\" and combined everything keeping me in the same room for the whole stay. Ended up with a two double bed room facing the pool. I would agree with other posters that the rooms are somewhat dated decor wise but it was very well kept. That's all I really care about. Beds were comfortable with a 32\" LCD TV that actually had HD channels. I used the pool facilities whenever I could and thought they were excellent. Usually not a problem to find a recliner and the double hottubs were terrific. There is a smaller adults only pool attached to the spa which I never used but heard from co-workers that though quiet, was quite cramped. The fitness area was very impressive. Most of my meals were provided via my conference. We did have evening drinks in one of the many bars on premises - very, very pricey. As is the bar menu for average food. So many good restaurants around the area on the boardwalk - you have no need to eat here. Service was excellent all-round from the front desk to the very helpful concierge. This hotel is massive but the staff treated me very well. Easy walking distance to everything. My only real complaint is something that has nothing to do with the hotel but more the location - the trolley line is across the street. There must be some San Diego bylaw that states all trolleys must honk their horn a zillion times when going through intersections regardless of the time of day. Constant honking of horns up to 1-2am (whenever they stopped). Very annoying - and something you'll get at any hotel in the area. And another note - other posters have commented that this hotel overbooks on a regular basis. My stay would seem to confirm this as during my stay, we received letters asking us if we would be willing to relocate to a different hotel in exchange for Hyatt Pts, credit, and other bonuses.

Pools, seems there are two, one Family and one Adults only near the Spa. Both very nice although the Family one is quite larger, both also have Hot Tubs but close around 10 PM. the hotel offers S'mores kits to enjoy at the various fire pits around the pool area. Hotel and Grounds were well maintained and kept clean. Our Room (777) was large and open with a spectacular view of both the city and the bay, big kitchenette with a full sized refrigerator, sink, microwave, large dining table w/ chairs, separate sitting area with flat panel TV and comfortable couches. The furniture is a little worn and dated but not too bad, no holes! Room was quiet, away from elevators, air conditioned. There is a lounge located on the top floor which offers great appetizers and cocktails, not too pricey, we went by the lounge located on one end of the Lobby but for some reason it was Party night, we couldn't even elbow our way in! They also have a more relaxed lounge at the other end of the Lobby that also offers snacks, drinks and even mini bottles of alcohol that you can take to your room, however the snack bar doesn't stay open very late at all, good for a quick breakfast! We stayed during the Comic Con Event and were quite pleased with the hospitality, and not that far of a walk. I usually went out the back of the hotel near the harbor ( nice relaxing walk) and strolled over to the Marriott next door and out to the front of the Concention Center, far less crowded than the sidewalks. Plus I was able to pick-up some items to snack on during the day at the Marriotts Comic Con snack bar set up in their Lobby. The city is pretty maneuverable without a taxi for the most part, if you enjoy walking; but the taxis are pretty decent price wise and try to get you to your destination as quickly as they can. DO NOT take a ride in those bike carts or they will take YOU for a \"ride\"! Would stay here again!

As usual, the weather was perfect. And, we were pleased with our stay in the Grand Hyatt. We were told this was the largest hotel in the West, and we believe it. It is huge and quite impressive. The lobby is like a work of art. It is beautiful! The staff at the front desk and the concierge were all very kind and friendly and everyone we met went out of their way to provide great service. The location of the hotel can't be beat. You're waterside, and you are steps away from the Sea Port Village, a darling little tourist area of shops and eating establishments. You're also within walking distance to the Gas Lamp district for wonderful night life. The hotel is in an idea location to see all that San Diego has to offer. ACCOMMODATIONS: Our room was a standard King and we got a very good rate ($110) through Priceline. Getting such a beautiful room at such a good deal helped us overlook a few of the problems we might have otherwise complained about. We were placed up on the 27th floor, and the room came with a spectacular view of the bay. I loved the fact that the window opened slightly to let in the sea breezes. But what an awesome view!!! Do try to get a room on one of the higher floors with a view if you can. The bed was wonderful and we slept quite well in it. The bedding was high-quality and the black-out draperies allowed us to sleep in as long as our bodies required. It was an excellent sleeping room - quiet and comfortable. No complaints there! IN-ROOM AMENITIES: I had some trouble when I first arrived as I could not find the coffee pot. I was quite disappointed, until I found it neatly tucked away inside the T.V. Cabinet. I was, however, disappointed to find that the room lacked a microwave and a refrigerator. Actually, this surprised me, as I always thought they were standard. We did have a little unit inside the TV cabinet, which we thought was a malfunctioning refrigerator, but when we spoke to the hotel engineer, we found it was not a refrigerator but a cooler. TIP: If you want a refrigerator and/or microwave, you need to make sure you are put into a roof with those features,. Perhaps they will provide them to you if you call the desk - I don't know. Just be sure in advance though, as we had some perishable food and it did not keep well in the 'cooler'. INTERNET: I always bring my laptop and the Hyatt did provide internet high speed access in-room. There is a fee of about $10.00 per day to use the service in the room. It may be free downstairs in the lobby area or other hot spots in the hotel, you would have to check on that, but expect to pay if you use it in your room. PARKING: Parking is available in a covered garage adjacent to the hotel. It's easy access and exit. There is a daily charge for parking. However, I can't remember right now how much I paid. You can self-park or use the valet. You can go in and out as many times as you want without extra charges. But be prepared to pay parking. There's no way around it. T.V. DISAPPOINTMENT: It was a lovely flat screen T.V. with a large sized screen, but for the life of me, I could never find a 'free' movie channel while there. Perhaps it was just 'me', but I couldn't even find an HBO showing free movies, and I didn't want to pay to watch one. FOOD: San Diego tourist areas are just plan expensive, particularly anywhere there on the bay side. It is hard to get around it. The hotel had some lovely restaurants, but on the pricey side. Sea Port Village, just steps away from the Hotel, is also pricey. We went off-site and away from the immediate area to eat. We found our healthy food place (Panera Bread) by Horton Plaza and had breakfast one morning. We walked to the Karl Straus Brewery for lunch for good Pub Food and a beer. For another lunch we ate at our favorite \"The Fish Market Seafood Restaurant\" which is right on the bay and within a short walking distance from the hotel (Expect tourist prices there, though you can buy some wonderful smoked albacore tuna or ceviche from the fresh fish counter inside the restaurant and take it back to the hotel).. Of course there is Anthony's Seafood Grotto, a major tourist seafood place, but it can be very, very busy at times.. TIP: If you want to save yourself a lot of money (particularly if you have kids with you) - be prepared. Either bring with you, or go find a grocery store, and stock up on bottled water, drinks, snacks and fruit for your room. OLD TOWN TROLLEY: First time we've done one of the Trolly Tours and we loved it! Tickets about $30.00 each for my husband and I. We bought them from the concierge desk at the hotel but you can also get them at the \"Old Town Trolley\" ticket kiosk nearby at the Sea Port Village. It's a low stress way to tour around San Diego: You can hop on and off and stay as long as you want at any of it's pre-chosen stops. You don't have to stress with finding expensive parking and fighting with the extensive tourist traffic if you take the Trolley. And, it is fun as the drivers give you some background 'tour driver' type information and attempt to be funny (some are really good!). We've been to San Diego many, many times and never taken this little Trolley, and I'm so glad we finally did! The hotel does seem to be very well prepared for families with children. It is a resort type atmosphere. There is a fire pit by the pool where the kids can cook marshmallows in the evening. Everyone seemed to be having lots of fun as I looked down from my room window 27 stories up! Through my open window, I enjoyed the beautiful sounds of children laughing and having fun. It was heart warming. So, it did seem to be a good place for parents to bring their children. I've probably forgotten something that I'll regret not saying later on, but that's the way it goes. I hope this helps someone. I'll attach a couple photos to give you an idea of the views we had from our room. Be sure to ask them for the type of accommodation that you want. It's your vacation and you want to be happy with where you are. I've learned it's always best to ask.

Outside food or drinks are not allowed in the pool area, and a bottle of water in the room is $4.50.

The hotel is definitely opulent and in front of Seaport Village. A friend stayed with me - our hotel room was nothing terribly exciting - clean, airy with in-room safe and fridge. No microwave and no air fan in the bathroom. Our hotel room overlooked the spacious pool - which we didn't get a chance to try out. As a hotel guest, I did try out the 24 hour fitness centre. It is one of the better fitness centres that I've seen with full circuit weight machines, rows of ellipticals, bikes and treadmills, and a small mirrored wall area with cables, yoga mats, Bosu, and medicine balls. Fresh eucalpytus scented towels and water are included in the fitness centre, so you need to only bring down yourself. I'm not a big fan of working out while on business or vacation, but this fitness centre made it really hard to resist. I didn't get to experience any of the restaurants on-site, with the exception of two. The lobby area serves as a lounge and you can order drinks and a full meal. The service is not very good between 9 pm - 11 pm. I wouldn't wait there for a meal, but perhaps to take in a drink or two (tip: sit at the bar so you get faster service). The other thing to denote for caffeine lovers - there is no Starbucks on site. The nearest one is across the street located at another hotel. There is a small coffee shop on-site that serves Starbucks coffee, but it's quite expensive, the food selection is not great and the line-ups are very long. They get a lot of business, undoubtedly from conference delegates who are caffeine-deprived, but the food and drink is really not very good for such a grand hotel. The hotel is within walking distance to downtown San Diego and it felt quite safe walking there during the day and night. If you don't want to go that far, you can always explore the restaurants and trinkets in Seaport Village, although it becomes quite deserted at night (not recommeded if you travel solo at night). Great coffee and eats await you in Seaport and there is a very lovely bookstore/cafe there that is absolutely charming and doesn't smell at all like Indigo or Barnes & Nobles. Seaport Village has a great seawall that you walk around for about 30 minutes in length - both ways. A great walk, especially if you have a dog. If you're looking to get out of the area and venture into outlet shopping, you can take the trolley bus to the Las Americas Outlet, just outside the Mexican border. I went to this outlet about five years ago and scored big, but this time came back empty-handed. It's a pretty far trip by trolley and I recommend going during daylight hours. You may spend up to 6 hours there if you're a hard core shopper, less if you're only going to specific stores. The trolley bus system in general is a bit confusing. Pay attention to the directions and to the bus signs. It is, however, the cheapest way to get around town so a little bit of inconvenience allows you to save your $$ for eats and shopping. San Diego is a really beautiful city any time of the year. The only other lasting impression I have is that it's a very dog-friendly city. We saw dogs everywhere from hotels to malls and all along Seaport Village (be sure to visit the doggie store in the Village for pampered pooch treats). I don't know if the Hyatt is a dog-friendly hotel, but we did see a few in the lobby so it's worth mentioning. This hotel is probably the biggest Hyatt that I've ever stayed in. Were it not for the fact that my employer paid for this conference, I probably wouldn't be able to afford to stay at this place for vacation. Even with the minor hiccups (e.g. bad coffee on-site, boring but clean room), it is undoubtedly a 5-star hotel. The concierge desk also deserves mention as they were unfailing helpful with three requests: 1. getting my fridge up and running; 2. getting immediate drycleaning for my ketchup spill all over my white jacket; and 3. mapping out our transportation routes to get to where we needed to go. My conclusion: if you are staying here for your conference - lucky you! Make time to enjoy the scenery outside the hotel and its on-site facilities. If you are debating on whether to book this hotel for your next San Diego vacation, try finding a price break on Hotwire or Priceline. You won't regret it once you pull up to the hotel.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moreno Valley, California", "Title": "\u201cMe and My Husband's getaway trip\u201d", "Author": "tazz3211", "ReviewID": "UR116065106", "Content": "The staff was nice and very informative. $600 for 3 nights, not bad.

Three of my coworkers stayed next door at the Marriott. I had a standard king room in the harbor tower: - Room was spacious and clean. Yes, the furnishings are a little older and do show some wear but nothing was stained or shabby. Considering the current focus on going green isn\u2019t it better to use perfectly good things longer anyway? - All of the staff that I interacted with were polite, friendly and helpful. - Check-in: I arrived early and parked in the garage, then used an automated kiosk in the lobby to see if my room was ready. It wasn\u2019t, but the kiosk gave me the option of receiving a text message when my room was ready. I entered my cell phone # and decided to visit my parents (I\u2019m originally from San Diego). I expected to have to pay since I did park; however, I was in the hotel less than 30 minutes and the parking attendant did not charge a fee. I received a text message later in the day letting me know my room was ready. - My room was larger than my coworker\u2019s standard room at the Marriott and had a refrigerator \u2013 hers did not. Although the water pressure at the sink could be better, the shower was great. - There is a great bar on top of the harbor tower with fantastic views. My conference ended early one day so I headed up with my ebook. Although the premium margarita I ordered was $14, I spent an hour relaxing, enjoying the view and reading \u2026 and it was a darn good marg. All in all, worth the $14. - Had crab cakes at Sally\u2019s one evening and they were fantastic (much better than the ones I got at a famous restaurant in Baltimore). - Walking distance: Marriot next door, Seaport Village (it still has some cute shops and restaurants), Midway aircraft carrier museum (worth touring if you have time!), Ralph\u2019s grocery store, CVS, gaslamp district, trolley station, convention center, Star of India, Anthony\u2019s (don\u2019t bother \u2013 it\u2019s gone way downhill and no longer deserves the reputation it earned 30 years ago), and the Fish Market. Pet Peeves: - The maids did not replace dirty water glasses \u2026 in fact one day the dirty glass was turned back over and set on the coaster again. - I had to ask for more coffee packs on one occasion (but they were replaced daily after that) - Hyatt stocks the WORST complimentary toiletries in the industry. It\u2019s some sort of musty, musky stinky floral sent that they call \u201cwhite ginger.\u201d I love the smell of ginger, but their fragrance bears no resemblance to the natural scent. I try to travel light and didn\u2019t bring my own shampoo, conditioner and lotion. Fortunately my coworkers who stayed at the Marriott had mercy on me and shared theirs (Marriott uses great smelling Bath and Bodyworks products). - Bottom sheets: Hyatt doesn\u2019t purchase fitted sheets, therefore the maids have to make do with top sheets that are inadequate to fully cover the bottom and tuck in securely. I\u2019m an RN with a black belt in bed making. If I can\u2019t get the bottom sheet to stay smooth and secure, nobody can. The bottom sheets come loose and creep up, then the bed pad underneath bunches up, and it\u2019s generally uncomfortable. WTF are they thinking??? - Parking is outrageous at $26/day (with in/out privileges). Standard for the area though. - Wi-Fi was nearly $13 per day. It makes me nuts that I can get free Wi-Fi at Starbucks, McDonalds, Village Inn, etc. where I\u2019m spending less than $10.

The bell hop area was nice in recommending dinner places too for the night. We would definitely stay at Manchester again.

My colleague arrived the same evening and was told there was no room available for her, despite a confirmed reservation. She and her family were also given a meeting room with wheeled in cots. They found the front desk staff to be very unhelpful. There are always long lines for the front desk and the concierge.

I decided to meet her in San Diego and stay with her. She attended her conference in the mornings and we met up each afternoon. This was my first trip to San Diego, not to mention California. Being from the Midwest, I wondered what CA would be like...all I've seen are the TV shows portraying extremes from the rich and the fabulous to lifelong hippies. This hotel helped make my stay in SoCal very satisfying. This hotel was a very quick 10 minute trip from SAN airport. Cabs were easy to find and the moment I stepped out of the cab, I was greeted by a hotel staff member opening the door for me and directing me inside the lobby. I wasn't expecting this and didn't have a tip ready, but I honestly don't think he expected one, he was all smiles and professional looking in his suit. I arrived before my friend did and had no issues checking in because we'd made the proper arrangements since her company was paying for the room and I was staying with her. The girl who checked me in was kind and courteous and answered all of my questions without rushing. She welcomed me to California and provided a room with a nice view. In walking to my room, I could see just how huge this hotel was. Many meeting rooms, large and small. There were several events going on at one time. The hotel public areas were always full of people and busy which made the hotel feel alive. There were two separate elevators - one for the lower level rooms and one for the higher floors. I can't lie and say I mistook the two a couple of times, no one's fault other than my own. The floors were quiet and traditionally tasteful. Our room was a typical hotel room with two double beds, nothing fancy, but it was comfortable. Only thing I'll note about the room and floors is that I felt trays sat outside of rooms in the hallways for a rather long time - breakfast trays were still in the hallways when it was almost dinnertime. I do know that the guests should call down though to let them know to pick up the used trays. After I checked in, I went to explore. I came from Chicago weather to San Diego weather - it was amazing. I checked out the fitness room so I knew where it was, and found the locations of the ATM, gift shop and pools. Then I ventured out the back door to find myself right in the middle of the touristy Seaport Village on the San Diego Harbor. Yes, touristy, but it was nice to have a place to walk and browse shops after my flights. There were tons of souvenir shops, many places to eat, even a Ben and Jerry's and a small cute cupcakery. This hotel is in a perfect location for this. I came down one morning to walk around the harbor and you can find other walkers and runners in the area. I especially liked the little shop selling organic/natural/local soaps and other toiletries. On my way back, I made a reservation at a seafood house for my friend and I and headed back to the hotel for a quick workout before my friend arrived. I really liked the workout room. It felt like a fitness center. It wasn't huge - most of the room was made up of Cybex type stations. But they did have a row of 10 treadmills and 6 elliptical machines and a small space for stretching. Also 3-4 stationery bikes. Some of the bikes and ellipticals overlooked the harbor and that was quite nice. The machines were of high quality and each had its own TV screen which I don't care to use, but a nice touch. There were plenty of towels, a fancy water cooler and even refrigerated cloths for your post-workout refreshment. I enjoyed running and ellipticalling watching the harbor! I noticed there were even locker rooms - I think there is some sort of private fitness club you can be a member of but didn't look much into it. The women's locker room had a bathroom with showers and sauna/steam rooms. I had to ask for directions quite a bit here. No matter where I went in the hotel, the staff was always well-dressed and they'd always smile at me or somehow acknowledge me and that is AWESOME for a hotel of this size. Sometimes the huge hotels have trouble with personal service. Even the housekeeper saw me coming back from the fitness center one morning of my stay and asked if I was sure I didn't need service. I'm pretty low maintenance and was only there a few days...I used the same towel each day and typically bring my own toiletries. She insisted that I take a couple extra towels just in case...in a polite way, so I did. The pool decks here are a treat. There is a huge 7th floor family pool deck with beds to lay out, the pool, and two small hot tubs. Each day, I found some time to lay out and soak up the sun...I preferred to be away from most people (kids..that is), so I pulled up a lounger next to one of the hot tubs and soothed away. One day they were closing the main pool deck for an event, and a worker told me about the \"spa\" pool on the 3rd floor. This is a smaller deck which you need your key for and is 21+ only. YEAH! I did spend a couple hours one late morning on this deck reading a magazine. We used the concierge services a few times and were very satisfied. We loved Phillip from Michigan - he was awesome. He had a band-aid when I hit my leg on one of the workout machines, gave us earplugs for the concert we were attending, and offered us discounted car rental service to a venue we were headed to. He told us to be careful and to check back with him the next day to make sure we were okay, as we'd be getting back from Solana Beach pretty late. We waved at him the next day and he shouted out, \"thanks for checking in, looking great, ladies!\". I'm sure he does this for all the ladies but it made us feel special in a lobby full of people...and it showed he cared. Instead of running, I decided to check out one of the hotel restaurants for breakfast my last morning there, called Lael's. They had a breakfast buffet which was about $25. I'm not a heavy eater, but I felt it was totally worth it. From the nice table settings, to our nice server - I forgot his name but he was from Peru - to the fact that cream cheese and lox was available. I'm not a meat eater so it was really awesome that I could have an egg white omelet and some lox/cream cheese/capers for breakfast with fruit and a splurge on a blintz, complete with berries and sweet whipped cream. But for the meat eaters, they had tons of good looking bacon and sausage too. Typically, when I travel, I wouldn't pay those kind of rates on a room - I typically go for mid-size, mid-price...but the company paid for this room and I enjoyed the stay immensely. If I'm ever in the area again, I'd definitely try to stay here. As huge as it was, I felt like it was an oasis on the San Diego harbor. This hotel is also within easy walking distance of the Convention Center, the commuter train terminal (if you're headed up the coast to Solana Beach, etc) and to the Gaslight downtown district with tons of restaurants and shops.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "California26", "ReviewID": "UR105151960", "Content": "I stayed two nights when I was in San Diego for a professional meeting and was very pleased.

There was however lots of dust on the tv table, the side cabinet in the dining room, etc so more attention to detail needed. We tried to connect through to the Concierge on 4 occasions, and kept getting the operator - easier to go down to the lobby for assistance. The pool itself in the Sea Tower is very tiny relative to the size of the sunbaking area. So lots of people in a small pool and it isnt enjoyable. Plus the ground around the pool is sticky from people spilling drinks, etc. The coffee shop was good for breakfast - Carol Ann's. The Business Center was closed early, so we had to use the alternate computer for USD6.95 for 15 minutes!!! which is outrageous considering most hotels offer for free these days. But we were informed that the Business Center would also charge that rate. The Fitness Center is fantastic - great equipment and a view over the harbour. Self parking expensive at USD26 per night - honestly, why??

Had I stayed there for a vacation and paid out of my own pocket, I may feel differently about my review. The common areas of the hotel were wonderful but most of my negatives center around the room itself. First, the carpet in my room had stains in several places. I recognize that the hotel is older and that, since I was paying the conference rate, I probably didn\u2019t get one of the nicer rooms, but multiple stains just make the room look not fresh and not clean. Second, I had a few issues with housekeeping. My expectation is that new hotel size shampoo and conditioner will be provided at least every other day (although really it should be every day). I shouldn\u2019t run out of shampoo after three days in the hotel. Another thing about which I am particular is the ice bucket; upon arrival, I filled the ice bucket (and bag) with ice. Of course, the ice melted overnight; my expectation was that it would be emptied and another bag be provided. Neither of these occurred. A final issue is that the rooms are not sound proofed very well. The first night I was awoken at 3 am by the next room blasting music; I called the front desk and this was taken care of promptly. However, on subsequent nights, I could clearly hear the phones ringing and people moving about in neighboring rooms. In truth, my quality of sleep for the entire trip was not good. On to the positives! The location is quite good; it is immediately adjacent to Seaport Village and near the convention center (not as close as the Marriott which is immediately next door to the convention center). The front desk staff are wonderful as are the restaurant staff. I ate at Sally\u2019s, AnneMarie\u2019s, Lael\u2019s, the Lobby Bar, and Redfield\u2019s while I was there. All were good and the service was wonderful. Internet and fitness center access were included with the conference rate: wifi was quick and the fitness center was nice. I also tried Kin Spa.

Our king bed was very comfortable and we could sit in bed and watch huge Navy ships running back and forth down the bay.

The shops near by are also a lot of fun to check out with a nice park in the middle on the grounds. We checked out Coronado Island (driving distance) and the Aircraft carrier (walking distance) near by. We visited the cocktail lounge at night and it turned out to be a lot of fun. Great drinks and appetizers with an awesome view of the city. My martini was very tasty! Breakfast is awesome! Eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy, waffles, omelets, etc...

I booked Hyatt at very cheap, nonrefundable rates online and read the reviews afterwards. Seems some people were unhappy with old rooms. So I requested a new room and was accommodated on the top floor of a freshly renovated tower. Hotel has a fairly grand entry lobby. Check-in was a breeze and the agent signed me up for some \"passport\" program which waived my internet fees. The room was great and clean and serviceable. Large flat screen was nice, remote a bit balky. Good bed. I ordered room service several times and room service really was good.fast and the food was delicious, except for a fruit plate I ordered one morning. The fruit wasn't good but the service was. Hotel location is ideal for seeing San Diego. You are steps from the Seaport and minutes from the USS Midway. Housekeeping was the slight letdown. They never replaced the plastic bag in my ice bucket nor did they move it back to where it should be. They didn't replace the in room tea (coffee maker, coffee and tea provided in room) on my 3rd day although they replaced it the previous day. Some hotels clean out the shower/tub and replace all the little soap bottles but they didn't here, although I think it's silly to replace something that's not used up.until the stay ends. Towels were adequate but not plush. There is one annoying super quirk at the hotel: it's near a train track and when those trains roll through at night the horns are loud enough to wake the dead, even 31 floors up. At least the beds are excellent so sleep was still good and comfy My other nit is the $25/day self parking. Thats a bit over the top but other hotels in other major cities do it too. I just wish the garage wasn't so filthy, dingy and poorly lit. Really kinda gross, even by standards of other similar hotels. Overall, the value here was excellent but I got the room at less than $100/night with taxes. I've stayed in flea bags for more.

Location: The hotel is located within walking distance to the Gaslamp District, Petco Park, and is adjacent to a small outdoor mall with restaurants and shops. You can walk or take a pedicab to just about anywhere - we only used a real cab to and from the airport and to the San Diego Zoo. Pool: The hotel has two pools - a quiet, adult pool and a general pool. We spent some time at the general pool and there were a lot of people and it was a busy place. The chairs are packed in close and get there early to get a good spot. We then took advantage to work by the adult pool and it was much quieter and more relaxing, with a lot more space and beautiful views. There is drink and food service to the pool and both chairs and little cabanas available for use. Rooms: The rooms are fantastic. The bathroom is large and the beds are comfortable. The first night we had an adjoining room with one room having a queen/king sized bed and the other two double beds and it was great. We moved down the hall for the remaining two nights and the rooms were just as good. The view was INCREDIBLE! We had gorgeous views of the marina, Petco Park, and Coranado. It was so wonderful to wake up each morning to see the ocean and the city. The one suggestion I would make is that they need to upgrade the TVs - both TVs I had were terrible, old tube TVs and one remote didn't work well. Service / Restaurants: The customer service was fantastic for both our stay and during the SACC event. We ate at the buffet breakfast and it was decent - not sure it was worth the money the company spent to have it there. The lunch for the SACC event was also okay - however, they didn't set up enough seating that we had reserved so we had some people with no place to sit and eat. The restaurant is so close to so many excellent restaurants that I highly suggest getting out and trying some of them. Overall: We had a wonderful time in San Diego and with our stay at the Manchester Grand.

I unpacked while the kids and my husband went to the pool. The closet was large and had lots of hangers. The armoire had three medium sized drawers in the centre with the room safe behind a door to the left, and a mini fridge behind a door to the right. As we were only staying for three nights I had no problem finding places for all our things, but with a family of four we might have needed more space if we were stayng longer. There were also some drawers in the nightstand between the two beds. We decided to have dinner at the hotel as we were tired after the long drive from Anaheim (well, we took the PCH starting at Newport Beach and stopped at Laguna Beach and Delmar enroute). We had returned our rental car to the airport after our week in Anaheim so wanted to stay close to the hotel our first night. We chose Redfield's sports bar in the hotel as it was casual, had a children's menu, and seemed to have a good atmosphere. Well, we liked it so much we ate dinner there the next two nights as well plus had an amazing Sunday Brunch. The serving staff were amazing (thanks Mindy) and the menu was quite varied. Our Christmas Eve dinner was Mac and Cheese for the kids and hot wings and nachos to share for the adults (plus some amazing local beer which has an obnoxious name that I can't post!). The servings were huge and yummy. The next two nights we shared salads which were also really good. The kid's burgers looked really good too. We usually avoid hotel restaurants but this one was a hit. Their Sunday Brunch was excellent too and extremely reasonable ($10 each for the buffet). My husband and son tried out the fitness facility and loved it. I swam in the outdoor pool Christmas Day evening at around 8pm for about 4 minutes and then sat in the hottub for an hour. We loved the pool area and would love to come back and use it when the weather is better. Even though the rains had stopped the weather was still very cool. Upon checking out (again, friendly professional and quick), we walked out front to catch a taxi to the airport. We were offered a ride to the airport in the large Hyatt SUV for a flat rate which was comparible to the cost of the taxi ($15 including tip) and we rode in comfort and style.

One of the most surprising deals is in the lobby bar area - while not \"budget\", everything was a good value by hotel and California standards - especially the calamari. This is a huge hotel (1,600+ rooms), but very efficiently run. We had an issue with the elevator doors and within an hour there was a repairman working. The front desk staff was incredibly helpful, and we even booked an extra 3 nights. While we stayed here, there were two college football teams booked at the hotel (along with their fans). The swimming pool area may seem small for the size of the hotel, yet we always managed to get lounge chairs, a spot in a jacuzzi or the pool. There is an open pit \"Smores\" area near the pool. The views from the upper floors are spectacular. Breakfast buffet was expensive, but is apparently included in many of the package deals. Food quality was excellent. For those on more of a budget, there is a Ralph's Grocery Store about 4 blocks away. Each room comes with a fridge, so it's smarter to just stock up on some essentails and pay for a cab. KC BBQ is located just across the street. It's OK, but true BBQ fans will be disappointed. Things to avoid: The shopping plaza just behind the hotel is filled with over-expensive places to shop and eat. Everything here is priced as expensive or more as the hotel! We tried a $9 forgettable sandwich at Seaport Village Deli and had the absolute worst food of the vacation at Buster's Beach House (and ran up a $45 tab for 3 appetizers and sodas).

A conference I attended was hosted there. The general hotel is very large and sprawled out with two very tours. There is a bar on the 40th(?) floor with magnificent views of the harbor and city. The room I stayed in was nice clean. It had a king size bed, soft and comfortable, however the comforters made it a bit hot for my liking. The air-conditioning system kept the room cool, but I think it was a bit of an aged system as the fan would blow hard for a few minutes, shut down for a few minutes, then repeat. I had some allergy problems on this trip and I suspect the AC filters were to blame; it wasn\u2019t that bad so I didn\u2019t address the problem. The bathrooms was pretty standard, it was clean and worked well. However, one problem, the shower head can move up and down a pipe, so you could adjust the height to your desires. The problem was the shower wouldn\u2019t stay locked into position, and kept slipping down, very annoying. I ate at their breakfast buffet one morning, very good selection, and excellent food, but also very expensive IMHO, $28.00. I also had diner one evening at the lobby bar and once in another bar on the other tower. The food selection was a bit shallow, but it was tasty and well prepared food. Expect beer to cost $5.50 to $8.00 a bottle. As I attended a conference at this hotel, I will also comment on those facilities. There were a number of small, medium, and large conference rooms available. The hotel also has two general session rooms that comfortably held all 600 of us. One of the general session sized rooms was for breakfast and lunch, and one was for general session presentations. Both rooms could have easily held more people. I think the hotel did a fine job hosting the conference, the meals were good, and the area was well maintained. Two small problems: the rooms were rather cool (most people would have said cold), and the area was sprawled out among different floors, and there was some long walks between rooms On a more fun note, I visited the USS Midway museum and the San Diego Zoo. The USS Midway is an aircraft carrier docked in the bay, and is a 10 minute walk from the hotel. Give yourself at least four hours to go through the ship. They have US Veterans there telling stories and talking about life on ship. In addition to the ship, they have lots of air craft of various vintages. The San Diego Zoo is a $15 taxi ride from the hotel. I was there for 5 hours, and could have stayed longer, but was tired (I had traveled that day). The zoo is immense, expect a lot of walking, and it isn\u2019t all level. They have lots of great exhibits, well worth the cost of entrance.

I paid about $90 compared to the $199 they were charging on other sites for this hotel. I was ready to be impressed. The hotel is very grandiose and reminds you of an old movie. The best part about this hotel was its central location. It is a 10 minute walk to Gaslamp and you can see the ocean from the top of the hotel. Other amenities include a pool and bonfire pits. The gym has a $5 charge per day I think? Also, parking is an arm and a leg. I paid $25 a day. Internet is $12.95 for minimal capabilities. If you want \"business\" level internet I think that is $16. It seems like a great hotel, however, it may be that because I booked through Priceline but the charm soon faded after I checked in. I came 1.5hrs early which is a little early but not early enough to skimp on quality. I was on the 8th level which I cannot complain about but if you can work your charm with the front desk, I suggest something a lot higher. When I got to my room, I noticed that the maid had just finished cleaning my room. I felt like she just rushed through to get her job done but did not thoroughly clean the room. When I went to the restroom, the toilet seat was still wet. There was remnants of something still in the sink. There was also lotion or some kind of liquid (who knows what!!?) sprayed across the wall onto the frame in the restroom. Although these things are minor, it made me paranoid the entire day about the other things she probably skipped on. I did not feel comfortable knowing that she rushed through cleaning. I felt that the room is aged, it will probably need to be upgraded in the near future. Overall, I felt like I was ripped off even though I paid half of the price.

We were first placed in the Harbor tower in a King with a view (22nd floor). Old bathroom, even though it is advertised on website as having marble tiling. Very old 25\" TV. Empty refrigerator in which to keep the sodas and snacks we bought at the grocery. Comfortable bed. E-Concierge had confirmed my request for a bathrobe, but there was none.

I used room service for breakfast a few times and was very satisified with service and product. Kin Spa is excellent, if that's your thing. The pool there is adults only, which is a good choice if the main pool area gets too crowded or noisy. Good work-out room- there's a $5/day charge; free for Gold Passport members. In room internet is $10/day for \"economy\". I tried the higher-priced \"business\" internet but found it not much faster than the cheap option. Overall, for such a huge hotel, they do a good job but can improve.

Overall, it was an excellent stay. During the week - it feels like you have many of the amenities to yourself. Location is great for shopping, clubs and view of the water. It was an easy walk to downtown. Less than 10 minutes. Seaport village is right there and the Gas Lamp district is also just another easy walk. If you decide you would like to go to the Zoo or the Balboa park area - it is really easy to catch the bus. Total travel time less than 30 minutes. I also utilized the trolley which is right across the street and made a transfer to the blue line to go to Chula Vista. Also very easy and quick. The hotel has a great pool area with a fire pit at night. Unfortunately, without warning they turn it off. They do no consider that people are enjoying it and just shut if off around 10pm which I think is a little early. There are two hot tubs on the 4th floor pool area. I only saw food/beverage service on the weekend. It could have been there through the week, but I never saw anyone taking orders. The 40th floor offers a great atmosphere. Dimly lit area at night (which I enjoy) with a lounge setting. Be prepared to pay $ for your drinks!! Very limited food selection. The morning breakfast is great. Our reservations included 2 free meals every morning. It is a buffet stye with many selections and custom order eggs. We tipped very well during breakfast, because service was very good, but I always left cash for the tip ($20) for a $59 bill. However, upon check out - I found where they wrote in an additional tip which amounted to a total of $85 in various amounts for the week. I was really upset. It wasn't just a one time occurrence. It was every day that this was added, so I'm not sure why that practice was believed to be ok. Upon check out - the charge was removed without difficulty and the lady was apologetic, but just made me a little skeptical. I think it is interesting that hyatt still refuses to guarantee a room type (i.e. one or two beds). I was traveling with a friend and requested two beds. Reservations were made two months in advance. We were given one bed which worked out, but there was a gentleman checking in with us that couldn't get a king and had to settle for two queen beds. I also think Hyatt needs to get on board with the free internet especially for the rate they are charging. I did not get a deal on this hotel. I did utilize a AAA discount, but this was still a significant expense that didn't include many amenities. I also stayed on the club level. Unless you know you really want a snack and free coke - then don't pay the extra. They offer free breakfast in the club level, but our purchase already included that option. You must also pay for your drinks here too, but you make them yourself. The room itself was nice and well maintained. I think it is interesting that T.V.s have been a discussion in previous reviews and are still the same despite management saying there would be a change, but this was not a big deal for me. I wasn't in San Diego to watch T.V. Overall, this was a very nice place. It offered everything was needed, but at a premium price.

This would not have been my hotel of choice purely on the basis of its size\u2026I prefer something more intimate. The hotel resembles a Las Vegas property without a casino. The d\u00e9cor was\u2026creepy. Guest rooms and artwork in public areas featured pastel colors and dewy-fresh white people of a non-discernable time period and geography cavorting about with livestock. At eye-level, guests at the Manchester are treated to a visual diary of Papa Doug Manchester and his brood at various Republican events and their love for outdoor sports. Has this guy ever been diagnosed with narcissism? The rooms are in a bad need of renovation. The hotel was built in 1992 and I would guess that none of the furnishings have been updated since then. The location was great and my room had a nice view of Coronado Island and the bridge. The view from the Top of the Hyatt bar is outstanding, but don\u2019t buy their line about it being one of the best upscale bars in San Diego. I think they have quite broad definitions of \u201cupscale\u201d and \u201cGrand\u201d at the Manchester Grand Hyatt. Despite the outdated furnishings, the room was a decent size and clean. The fact that the minibar was removed of all contents prior to my arrival was a bit offensive. I mean seriously\u2026you all put a $500 hold on my credit card...nice way to make a customer feel like trash. But nevermind\u2026the empty refrigerator made for a nice place to store water and wine during my visit. There was a Ralph\u2019s supermarket 3 blocks away where I could stock up on some food and beverage and keep in the refrigerator. The housekeeping staff was attentive and pleasant. I wish the same could be said for the front desk staff\u2026rude. I dislike being huffed at and informed, \u201cyou\u2019re a bit early\u201d for attempting to check in at 1 pm. It may be 1 pm for you, but for people arriving from the East Coast (as I was), it\u2019s 4 pm and we\u2019ve endured a long flight\u2026cut us some slack. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve EVER been put on notice in this fashion by other hotels of the same class (Westin, W, Omni, Intercontinental). Is this a Hyatt thing? A gracious host doesn\u2019t notify you when they\u2019re doing something nice for you\u2026Just some advice Manchester. The fitness center wasn\u2019t complimentary\u2026there was a fee! (To make a comparison to a competitor, I\u2019ve never been charged to use the fitness facility at Westin\u2026in fact they have on occasion given me a room with a Precor machine). Internet had a fee\u2026surprise. And the connection speed wasn\u2019t so great\u2026almost like a fast dial-up. But what truly counterbalanced the negative was the Kin pool area. I love the adult-only environment and the weekend party scene. It was a great way to end a tough week of work. Kin Spa was AMAZING! I had one of the best massages that I can recall. The prices for services were actually quite reasonable. But be aware that they automatically add 20% gratuity as a \u201cconvenience.\u201d I personally have no issue with this, but others may, so be warned.

They stayed at the next door Marriott. I read the reviews and did not know what to expect as there were so many. We checked early 1:30 pm no problem. From the get go there did not seem to be any problem but me at first. I forgot to request a smoking room and we had to switch. The front desk switched us to a smoking room and said someone would meet us at the new room in the opposite tower a good walk. However after a 15 minute wait at the door of the new room I went down to the front desk and got the keys myself. As I got back to the new room the newbi asst. mgr. was leaving. When I went inside my brother told me that the newbi had let him into our new room but then when my brother asked him for a the keys he had a blank look and said sorry and left. Not inspiring,and as I think what was he smoking. I then went to the main pool on the 4th floor a great location. I was asked 10 times in 3 hours if I wanted a drink by the pool waitress. I saw adults and kids and conventioneers or seminar people having a good time in the water, restaurant/bar area that has a great view of the San Diego Bay. My only complaint was that the Hot Tub was 104f a bit too hot. However the company was great. Went to the game slept great and I did not notice bed linens as a problem. We came back the next afternoon after a day ball game and hit the 3rd floor pool that was for adults. Very relaxing with a pool bar. Hot tub was perfect at 101f for me. we had some drinks in the sports bar in the north tower and went to Seaport Village for dinner a short walk away. Then back to room. At about 12:00am the room next to us started a party that went on until the wee hours and I could hear it. Before I went to sleep after reading a bit, I dipped into my travel bag and brought out my old fashioned anti-noise weapon to combat this aural onslaught: Ear Plugs-\"Don't ever stay in a hotel without them.\" You can buy the foam ones that mold to your ear canal at all the drug stores and most are rated for commercial use like snoring, now cheaply. The next morning it was a easy in room check out and then bailing my car out of parking. Overall my only complaints are the price for valet parking of $34 a day and the distance from the bar to the nearest mens room. From what I saw and from other complaints like the newbi without the keys, I know that this area and this hotel always has a high front of the house staff turnover with lots of new employees so there are bound to be problems as locating clean rooms as the previous poster noted. I hope they contact Hyatt Corporate directly for a full refund. Other than that it was not that bad; The cleaning staff and room maids were the best representatives for the hotel that I saw. If i needed anything on the cart for my room all I had to do was ask. Yes it needs some minor upgrading. Yes Management, Corporate and Hyatt Franchising/ Training needs to help train the front of the house staff better. But for the rest of complaints I have read on this board it seems there are more complaniers. Come on people when you stay away from home it is different. There could be noise in a hotel, late. When you call ahead for a request ask for confirmation in a email/text/letter with your confirmation number and the name of the person you talked to. I have alway found that if there is there is a problem with the room contact the manager first, and if the problem continues let him know you will go up the line if the problem is not resolved. Always remember you as the customer, have the power when you are there. As after you leave you you can only complain here.

With the look of its lobby and general atmosphere you can see that this hotel wants to be a resort destination but falls a little short; some of this is in control of the hyatt/some of this is not. My reservation for the Manchester was for a family package (50% off the second room, adjoining and breakfast plan). Basic point is be sure to verify your email reservation details exactly in the email confirmation. A few weeks before arriving I called to change my arrival date and verify the reservation to find out the adjoining request had not been confirmed, which the reservation agent told me it had.. obviously a challenging situation with small kids but luckily something I corrected well before arriving and specifically asked for an email showing this request. When I actually arrived at the hotel; found out the wrong \"family plan\" had been reserved resulting in the breakfast plan not being added to my reservation .. again took several conversations with the staff and management (and a call to central res.) but ultimately things got fixed .. not sure if these issues were via central reservation or the Manchester directly but there seems to be an issue with their promotion packages so be sure to double check everything. Regarding the train horn comments .. you are going to hear the train regardless of your room location .. accept that if you're staying here. The metro, freight and commuter trains all pass the hotel on a track that is about 100 yds off the hotel and perpendicular to both towers, therefore all the rooms experience it. It's not that big a deal but if you're expecting no train horns; then you'll be disappointed. It is a downtown hotel and the street noises of a downtown location apply. For the size and cosmetics of the hotel, yes the pool is a bit small and it does seem like the suntan lotion film builds up at times; but again other factors are net positive; the elevated pool deck with a view of the San Diego waterfront and skyline as well as the various activities they try to plan for the kids gives almost a cruise like feel to the pool/hotel. Breakfast buffet was fantastic and not just because we had it comp'd as part of the rate plan .. really a good buffet (waffles are very tasty). We were out for other meals so can't comment on the restaurants for the other meals.

Our room was spacious and clean and the bed was very very comfy. The view on the harbor was amazing too! From our room we could see the harbor, Seaport Village, the USS Midway museum and some skyscrapers. The only drawbacks of the room were the old TV set, the internet connection fee ($12) and very little toiletries, but I guess we could have asked for more and we would have got them. We asked for more towels and they brought them to us right away. The service was very excellent. Our friends in the suite asked if they could fix the shower because it was leaking and instead of fixing it they were upgraded to the Manchester suite! It's on the 39th floor, which is the highest, and you can't have access to it if you haven't got a card that allows you to push the 39 button in the elevator, so we had to get our friends in the lobby (which is absolutely beautiful btw) to get us to their room. The junior suite was very nice, with a kitchenette, a living room with a big table for 8 persons, 2 couches and some armchairs, a master bedroom with a king-size bed, 2 bathrooms and a view on the whole bay, on the Coronado bidge and on the island and baseball stadium too. The Manchester suite was very fancy! First, the walls in the 39th floor hallways were made of glass so you could see the pool and the whole bay and the suite was just fabulous! A big living room with sofas and armchairs around the TV (which was old too), a big dining table, lots of ancient chinese pieces of pottery everywhere, a small kitchen, a huge master bedroom and 2 big bathrooms (one didn't have a shower though). The view form that suite was very nice too, but I have to say that the one from the standard suite was nicer. If you want a suite at the Hyatt I'd suggest to get the standard one. As of the other services, we went to the pool in the morning and it was pretty crowded but quiet anyways. They gave us towels and deckchairs and complimentary mints, chapstick (you could choose orange or coffee flavor) and key ring. We ordered food there but we didn't really like it. It wasn't very expensive but tacos were not so good and fruit too. Our friends got room service for breakfast and said gauffres were gorgeous though. I would recommend the hotel afterall since you can get to the Gaslamp quarter (where all the restaurants and nightlife are) in just 10 minutes on foot or you can rent bikes for the hotel.

Fantastic location right on the bay, adjacent to Seaport Village/waterfront park, and 5-10 minute walk to convention center and downtown. Impressive towering hotel with amazing lobby. The hotel staff in all areas were fantastic and accomodating. Rooms were fine and extremely clean along with the rest of the hotel and grounds. We stayed on the 9th floor facing the city and it was pretty loud. Windows do not drown out much noise. Between the traffic, sirens, adjacent train tracks, and various aircraft it was almost ever present. Couple that with the loud AC system and it could be an issue for some folks. Perhaps if you request an inside room facing the other hotel tower it would be less of a factor, but you give up on some of the view. Found the hotel food to be quite good and moderately priced. No free in-room wi-fi and parking is steep but common in San Diego. Fantastic and complete fitness center but there is a charge if you are not a Hyatt Passport Card member. We traveled with small children (under 10) and they loved the play area with field turf adjacent to the outdoor pool. Plenty of room to run around, play ping pong, foosball, kick soccer balls, throw the football, and even basketball courts. It added a ton to our trip and was an awesome touch! The outdoor pool is great with nice views all around. One small item was they did not have typical children's programming available on the TV line-up such as Disney or Nick which I found odd. Older TV's, no flat screens, and the picture and sound were inconsistent from channel to channel in our room.

Bedding was wrinkled like it was left in the dryer too long. Old box set TVs, like 22\". Asked for a rollaway bed at noon ( after we had to move from our first room that was a double, to a king) I needed a place for my 2 year old to sleep. Never got it. Had to call back at 8pm for the rollaway, did not recieve it until almost 9pm. Was dismayed to see a hallway FULL of extra rollaways down the hall from my room, after I literally waited 9 hours for one. Paid extra for the Grand Club. What a joke, it is a room like the breakfast bars in the holiday inn, you just need a key to access it and the floor its on. Everytime i went there, except for breakfast, there were no employees there. By the way breakfast in the club room is shabby too, Holiday Inn's breakfast bar is way more extensive and better food. Grand Club boasts concierge, and I called them twice only to be transferred to guest services, I still cant figure out what it is they do exactly. Their little paper booklet about the Hyatt had a booger and coffee stains on it. (I have pics of that by the way) Room decor was at best dissapointing in comparison to the lobby. If every room was decorated and cared for like the lobby this review might have been different. Like i said in desperate need of a re-launch. Only good thing about this hotel was the view. Thats it. Everything else was just scummy. Gross. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY, and I got a 50% discount because of all the problems. Only spoke to one employee that seemed to care. Customer service was abissmal at best. I honestly thought they should have comped the whole thing. The hubby and I cut our trip short because we could not stand being there for even one more minute. As my husband left ( we took seperate cars) he tried to get his parking stub validated, to which he was told that the garage we parked in (the big one attached to the hotel that says Hyatt on it...) wasnt their garage and parking isn't free. He then asked to speak to a manager, to which the 3 employees that were there (it was real early) refused. He asked two more times and they still did not. They acted as they couldn't hear him. When we left the garage, that \"isn't run by Hyatt\", it was attended by a Hyatt employee in uniform. When the hubhub and I go back to San Diego, we will stay elsewhere.

Beautiful public spaces, clean rooms - but very average accommodations (furnishings a bit worn, surprisingly.) Our original room given to us on the 14th floor had a large fan drying an obvious wet area on carpeting. We asked for a place to wait or other room and was given an upgrade on the 24th floor - with a spectacular view of the harbor and Seaport Village below! Hotel staff extremely accommodating & very gracious to give us this new room promptly! The view was the best part of this hotel stay. We even got to enjoy scenic fireworks off the USS Midway, watched from our 24th floor room. The room upgrade was really for the view, because room furnishings were a bit disappointing: noted worn areas on chair/draperies/bedspreads, slight stains on carpeting in this room. Disappointed that internet was not free/included, but co$t additional $10/day. ('Thought free internet was fairly standard in most hotels today, especially hotels of this quality?) San Diego is an expensive town, & this hotel was no different. Restaurants in hotel quite pricey, but we only ate at Redfield's (sports bar in lobby of hotel.) Food was O.K., but nothing special - except the price. Room service menu was way out of our league as well. Seaport Village next door had several smaller restaurants/cafes with excellent food at a little more reasonable prices. We especially enjoyed The Pier Restaurant - great seafood! Hotel is in a good location for walking to Convention Center and downtown/Gaslight District. There were many things to see & do here. Also enjoyed the San Diego Trolley Tour, which picks you up right next door at Seaport Village. Be sure you get to visit Old Town San Diego as well: what a wonderful tour back through history here! A very enjoyable day! Hotel staff were very helpful, providing maps of areas we requested & additional area information. We found Kansas City BBQ - across the street from the hotel (Top Gun movie with Tom Cruise, et al.....filmed some scenes here) had terrific food & better prices. One of the 2 hotel pools was closed, & the 2nd pool had some private party going on the one time we tried to use it, therefore gave up on a swim altogether. Our stay at the Manchester Grand Hyatt had its high & low points. We were a bit disappointed, & expected a little more for the price we were paying to stay here for a week.

Of course there are always pros and cons to every hotel. I will start with the pros: The location is near everything in downtown San Diego. You can walk everywhere easily. The views of the bay are amazing. I liked being next to seaport village and the gaslamp district. The service was great. Everyone was friendly and checkout was simple...no issues. Maid service was timely. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. I slept well every night despite all of the train and harbor noise. The common areas in the hotel are very elegant. I got a deal on our room so overall I was pleased. There were a few cons: I did not like their pool area. Most of the time they had it closed for maintenence. It seemed sort of blah if you ask me and I don't think I would have used it even if it was open. We walked next door to the Marriott and that pool is far superior, with waterfalls and firepits...the whole works. So if you are a big pool person, stay at the Marriott. The Hyatt caters to a convention crowd, so take note of that. We ate a very overpriced breakfast which I do not think was really worth it. Yes the rooms are a tad dated, esp. the bathrooms. But I didn't mind, because they were clean and everything worked correctly. I would stay at this Hyatt again because the service was good and they seemed to have everything together.

Decent coffee maker (although being picky would have preferred china cups instead of disposable cups but I know this is quite the norm in the states). Good amount of storage and nice spacious bathroom. Nothing to fault room wise. The decor is a little dated, but the king bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. I heard other people moaning that there were shower curtains over the bath instead of shower cubicles, but they were clean and totally prevented water from spilling on to the floor. The baths were the typical rather shallow american baths but there was nothing wrong with them. No the TV wasn't a plasma but then I dont go away to watch TV and as long as the picture is OK then I dont mind! Housekeeping was prompt and efficient, always plenty of towels and hot water. I am not usually a fan of the big buffet breakfast but found it to be delicious with plenty of choice and great service. The pool area was lovely, my only complaint would be with lazy guests who when they have finished around the pool are too idle to put their used towels in the large bin so other guests would know which loungers are available. The sun loungers had nice mattresses on them. There was a nice pool bar up on the sun terrace and food was delivered to the terrace via ordering over the telephones up by the pool. The food served up there was superb and I thoroughly recommend the Jerk Chicken Salad. The Top of the Hyatt Bar was ok. I prefer to be outdoors in such a beautiful place, the view was magnificent but I thought they could make more of it. Sallys on the water was great for sitting out on the waterfront sipping cocktails and we had a nice dinner there. I REALLY hope to return to San Diego (my husband was attending a conference) I have been to several American cities and it has to be my favourite.

It is really a shame their positives could not over come the laundry list of negatives. Room - Very run-of-the-mill overall. Furniture in need of updating despite our being in the \"new\" tower. 20\" CRT TV with terrible reception. Beds were tolerable. Hot water and water pressure both were acceptable. Air Conditioning - Upon check-in we were given an \"optional upgrade\" for a premium view in the newer tower. We accepted the $25/day premium, and admittedly enjoyed the view. The only problem was that if you opened the drapes to look outside, the temperature increased exponentially. Our A/C thermostat was set to 68 degrees, but after only one hour of the drapes open, the temperature rose to 87 degrees in the room. We called maintenance, who was very friendly and attentive, but who told us we would have to keep the drapes closed if we wanted the room to be cool. This surprised us based on a 68 degree high temperature outside! To cool the room we had to prop the room's door open and run the A/C full out for two and one half hours.The next day we left the drapes pulled all day with the thermostat still set at 68 degrees, and the room still rose to 77 degrees. When I discussed this with the staff, they said that they had not heard the same from any other guests. At dinner that night we heard that three others from our group had also complained. Adjustments were made and our view mitigated from pulled drapes, and by ten o'clock it was bearable. Reservations/Confirmations - We arrived prior two days prior to some of the rest of our party, and when we checked in we re-confirmed their check-in schedule two days prior to their arrival. The day before, we also confirmed their arrival and reservations. We re-confirmed at two hours prior to their arrival - each time be assured that there were no problems and that their rooms were guaranteed for late arrival. One of the party was coming from Sweden (with his 8 year-old son), the other from Mexico City. Both arrived to find that they had been bumped due to over-booking. This despite our confirming and re-confirming as recent as two hours prior to arrival. The one traveling from Sweden, with his 8 year-old son, had been in airplanes/airports for 21 hours upon arrival to San Diego. Suffice to say that another delay just added insult to injury. No apology offered, only a voucher and a taxicab ride to a hotel back at the airport. Two hours later, they were finally in a room. After repeated requests for an explanation, the staff only offered that they could not help it, they were just overbooked. Shockingly, they even said that they had been inconvenienced \"just as much as we were\" with the overbooking! I discussed the entire situation with the Assistant GM, who I originally was told had left for the day and he guaranteed me that he would investigate and \"get right back to me\". He cared so much that he did not even bother to call back. UPS deliveries - On our third day we had a time sensitive package to be delivered by 8:00 AM. At 7:30 AM, I called both the front desk and the shipping and receiving department to have them \"be on the lookout\" for the package. At 8:05 AM, upon being notified by UPS that the package was delivered at 7:20AM, I called again to the front desk, the shipping department, the bell desk and the business center and was assured that it had not arrived. With my patience waning, I called the GM of the property. He assured me that he would personally investigate it and report his findings. He called in about one and a half hours to say that the package \"was absolutely not on property nor had it been delivered - thus it is not our fault\". Five and one half hours (and 27 telephone calls later) they found the package - sitting in the receiving department exactly where it was supposed to have been and that it had, in fact, been delivered at 7:20AM. Needless to say, after the emphatic denial I heard nothing more from the GM. No apology, no explanation, no effort to rectify - nothing - zilch - nada. The problems with this property are much deeper than just the philosophy of the upper management. We found them to be rude, indifferent and absolutely refused to accept responsibility for any of their numerous gaffs. I moved our entire party to the Marriott next door who were unbelievably and genuinely appreciative of our business. We also changed three dinners that had originally been scheduled for the Hyatt (a total of 37 meals and drinks). I wish that I felt that the Hyatt had learned from their mistakes but I seriously doubt it. The 14 hotel nights @ $280 each and the dinners/drinks would amount to something around $8000 of lost revenue, based on my estimation. I suppose that the Hyatt can afford walking away from the business. Do not be convinced for a moment that they care - as I have not received a single call from anyone in management regarding any of these issues. jcrowleyiv@tx.rr.com", "Date": "May 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cGood service and breakfast.

My husband was attending a conference and I tagged along. We stayed at this same hotel several years ago and our stay then was fine. This trip, we both realized that while we love the location of the hotel, the hotel itself is not that great. On the positive, the location is right near the Gaslamp district and in close proximity to the Seaport Village so it was nice to be able to walk to shopping and dining. We did have a nice view from our room of the pool and the water. We saw some great sunsets but the windows were so FILTHY the pictures just showed the extensive brown dirt on the windows. They are long overdue cleaning the windows. My problems with this hotel are: Housekeeping/daily maid service was horrible. The bed was made up each day and towels were refreshed as necessary but beyond that, they didn't empty the trash in the bedroom area, didn't provide clean glasses (I had to find the maid to get new glasses) never vacuumed the room, didn't even show up one day until after 6:00 pm when I called TWICE to ask that our room be serviced. Restaurants were not good. Food in the sports bar was not good and the menu was very limited. One drink with premium gin was 9.00 at the bar. So, a 1/3 lb. burger with one cocktail was 25.00. Now, if the burger were great, I wouldn't have felt badly. But it was not good at all. We did order room service one night and it was pretty good, but they left our tray outside our door over 24 hours. I had to call twice to get them to finally come pick it up. It was probably our tray that the other reviewer is referring to! They also left bundled up dirty sheets in the hallway alot, too. I could never figure out why. Also, they have limited tv channels! They have network and a few others like ESPN, etc. They closed the pool one day at 2 for a private function. Since it was the only really nice \"pool\" day, I was not happy at all about that. Then there is the train. ALL DAY AND NIGHT LONG that TRAIN blew its horn several times to where it woke us up every night! Now parking. We got a rental car but returned it a day later because self parking at this hotel is $22.00 a day! This hotel clearly caters to the convention crowd and since I wasn't part of that, I can't speak for how they handle the meeting aspect of it, but if you are a leisure traveler, find another place to stay.

Tons of restaurants to choose from in easy walking distance as well as Hyatt's own excellent restaurants, Sally's was spectacular & Redfield's Deli serves Starbucks coffee! We have never stayed at a hotel of this caliber so the price, considering I am unemployed, was a bit high HOWEVER, the view was well worth the price.

The location was absolutely perfect...right on the bay (nice view from all rooms) within a short walk of the Gaslamp area, Seaport Village is right outside the door, the U.S.S Midway and the ferry to Coronado are just a few blocks away, the water taxi stops just a block or so away, and the train stops right in front of the hotel if you want to venture further from the hotel. Some reviewers have complained about the noise from the train....you could hear the train, but in my opinion it was just background noise that you would hear at any hotel in the dowtown area of any major city... nothing to worry about. The rooms were very nice and like I said before they had a great view of the bay. Our only minor complaint was that when we checked in we were told that they did not have a room with a king bed or a view over the pool so we brought our stuff up to the room they gave us. On our way down we talked to someone else about letting us know when a different room was available. She said a king room overlooking the pool was currently available and seemed confused as to why we were told otherwise when we checked in.

We had a great time and honestly didn't have enough time in San Diego. Sea World was probably our highlight...just amazing. I'm glad we went to the zoo, but it really is just like any other zoo, just a little bigger maybe. Seaport Village was great for a morning walk and to do some shopping.

I had a corner room on a higher floor (13th? 15th?) and from there I had a view of both downtown and Coronado Island across the bay. I could see the cruise ships, sailboats, tugboats, and military ships cruising the bay as well as the beautiful city lights at night. I had been to this hotel before for Comicon, but I did not spend the night there. Based on my visit (lobby areas) I didn't expect much. Typical Vegas-style chain hotel. However, my stay was great! Room was spacious and well-appointed with free Internet, refrigerator, sitting area, and working area. Bathroom was less upscale and more pedestrian. Parking was good. I used both the valet and self-parking. Location was nice. I was able to walk to Seaport Village for breakfast and it wasn't *too* much of a walk to Gas Lamp or Little Italy in the evenings as well as the USS Midway and the contemporary art museum. If you have business at the convention center (I didn't) it's just one hotel over. It wasn't as convenient to downtown as some of the other hotels, being more on the periphery of town. The lounge on the top floor has beautiful views. Pool area was very nice with two jacuzzis. Only complaint is that the food is expensive and mediocre. I would probably rate 4 stars, but I am rating 5 stars because my room and the view were so lovely. I would definitely ask for a corner room again, even if it costs more. A stay in an inner room would be less pleasant. One big negative was the train. The tracks are right outside the hotel and there is not only the constant trolley traffic, but also fully loaded freight trains passed in front of the hotel with a lot of attendant whistle-sounding. The city needs to do something about this by rerouting the trains or something. I didn't mark this hotel down because almost all hotels will suffer from the problem. Same with the occasional horns from the ships, one of which woke me up out of a sound sleep. However, that only happened once during the stay. I was pretty pissed at the time, but when it didn't recur I got over it. Again, the hotel gets a pass because you can hear a noise that loud from everywhere.

There's a small pool with lounge chairs on the fourth floor that overlooks the harbor - great play to sunbathe on hot day. Concierge is really helpful in planning activities and booking tickets in advance. I really liked the restaurants and shops by the harbor, I believe it is called the San Diego village. It's a good place to pick up souvenirs or cheap food since you can likely pick up a hefty tab at most of the restaurants in the hotel. There's a pizza, Mexican, Mediterranean, and ice cream joints. It's also a good place to catch the sun set along with a cheap pitcher of beer. Speaking of which, you MUST go to the top of the Hyatt and enjoy the views -- again on both sides of the lounge you can enjoy city views and harbor views. Great place to go for moderately priced drinks and watch the sun set. We even got complimentary champagne and took plenty of pictures! One thing to watch out for is the extra charges to use the gym.

Very helpful staff (Lauren?) ... she combined my 2 diff reservations into one (so I didn't have to move rooms!). Grand Club - continental breakfast was better than I imagined. Besides the assortment of bagels/muffins/toast you'd expect, there was an assortment of fresh berries (yum!), melons and cheeses. Evening appetizers were equally delicious and non-standard fare. We were never in the hotel during the day, but I think there were snacks/sodas offered all afternoon. Definitely worth the extra $ for Grand Club, esp. when traveling with 3 hungry kids (ages 11-14). Location - walking distance to everything: convention center, downtown/Gaslamp, harbor, bank & grocery store. Pool area - included two jacuzzis and fire pit overlooking the harbor. Cons: Rooms - we were in the South? (closest to conv center) tower. The rooms are small, but clean. They are definitely in need of renovation. Countertops/fixtures were really old (like a 2 star hotel). The lack of a bathroom fan probably contributed to the carpet outside being a bit soggy (had to leave the door open to vent) our entire stay. It seemed impossible to get 4 towels (even aft calling) each day or replenishment of bathroom supplies. There's a club outside by the pool (diff than the main pool) playing loud music until 2am. It wasn't terrible, but then again we were high up (30 flr). Internet fee - they must be one of the few hotels that still charge ($12.95) per day.

Turns out they cannot put a rollaway in the rooms with two double beds (fire code). The clerk (TINA) looked at how long we were staying, and asked me to wait a moment. She returned and told me they were going to move us to a larger room, big enough for two rollaways.

There was a Murphy bed for me, and two rollaways for the boys, a sofa, a dvd player, and two large windows looking out over the bay. I was dumbfounded.

As an architectural landmark it's breathtaking and definitely worthy of the word grand from it's strong wood arches and marbled lobbied floors, the Hyatt on the outside is pleasing to the eye. Its pool is reminiscent of a Las Vegas hotel pool, one of the larger ones in the downtown San Diego hotel district and ample room for everyone to lay out and enjoy the gorgeous weather. The breakfast buffet at Lael's is abundant (omelet station, lox and bagels and delicious coffee) and service is outstanding. The Hyatt also incorporates a lot of complimentary family friendly activities such as a swim-up movie at nightfall, for a small fee you and your fam can enjoy s'mores by the fire pit and an all day activity area for lawn bowling, football and foosball.

I called the hotel directly to ask questions about the noise level and the pool closure situation mentioned in another review. The manager assured me that our family would have a great room. She was not wrong! Our family received exceptional hospitality at the Manchester Grand Hyatt. The lobby is fantastic and looks just like the pictures on the Internet. Our welcome at check in was very friendly and accommodating. I explained to him that one of our girls had thrown up in the car on our way from Disneyland and asked to have a roll-a-way bed. He said that we probably didn't need it, but if I wanted one he was happy to send one up. I guess I had a puzzled look so he proceeded to say that we were in an 1,100 sq. ft. suite. I booked a regular room. We walked in the double doors to our room to find a huge hotel room complete with 2 sitting rooms with 3 couches, a dining room with seating for 8, an office, a kitchenette with an apartment size refrigerator, 2 bathrooms, a separate king bedroom and a full size Murphy bed in one of the sitting rooms. We were pleasantly surprised stay in a hotel suite that was equivalent to 5 rooms. The hotel went above and beyond to make our stay fantastic! It was a wonderful treat to be upgraded to a suite. The kitchenette counter was full of goodies for us and the girls when we checked in. My girls thought they were living \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\". They loved it! The management at the Hyatt made our stay truly magical. We know that our stay was exceptional, but we still will highly recommend this hotel to our family and friends. The room was perfect for our family and would be great for a large family or a business traveler on an extended stay. Some details to note: 1. This is definitely a convention hotel . It is the 2nd largest Hyatt in the world with over 1,600 rooms. This is probably why you find the Manchester on Hotwire and Priceline. Parking was convenient and easy to find a space. The rate was $22 per day for self parking. I know some people complain that this is high, but parking in a big city is to be expected. 2. The location is fantastic! It is walking distance to the Gaslamp District, the Convention Center, the Seaport and more. The views are spectacular. I've attached some pictures that I took from the hotel. 3. We did not try the hotel restaurants. They seemed busy and the food smelled great! There was a barista preparing coffee drinks to order in the morning. Coffee drinkers will love it! We purchased groceries at the nearby Ralph's Grocery store for breakfast items since we had a refrigerator. 4. The outdoor pool was beautiful. It was heated, but too chilly for me. My husband and kids swam, but I preferred the hot tub. There were 2 of them on either side of the pool deck. Both with great views of the harbor. I've attached some pictures. There is another pool in the spa area that is converted to a night club in the evenings during the summer months. We could hear the music when we were outside on the regular pool deck. There were a lot of young professionals staying at the hotel. The poolside bar was bustling with activity and people of all ages were seen throughout the hotel property. It seemed like a place to be seen in the evening. 5. Our room was very large and appointed well. The king bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows. They seemed to be down with a down duvet, but I can't be sure now. The king bedroom was handicap accessible in the bathroom. There were handles and a seat in the shower and handles near the toilet. There was a full length mirror in the bathroom for guests who could not see in the mirror over the sink. The lighting in this bathroom was not great. It would be difficult to put make up on with the dim florescent lighting. The countertops were marble with tile flooring. The curtains in this bedroom were remote control. I'm not sure if this was because it was a suite or if it was a handicap feature, but they were very cool and worked well. 6. In the foyer, there was another bathroom. This one was quite grand with 2 separate sinks on opposite walls, a toilet and a shower/tub. The countertops were green marble and the marble/tile accents on the floor and walls were cream and yellow. The lighting was excellent and included recessed lighting in the shower. 7. The furniture in the sitting rooms, dining room and office were dark green and golden yellow. It was a classic style. The furnishings were older, but well taken care of and in good condition. There were lots of accessories to make it seem like a professionally decorated room. As I said before, my kids thought it was super luxurious and they were in heaven! 8. This might not seem unusual to those who travel out west, but we were surprised that the windows opened. In the South it is too hot and humid to open the windows. It was nice to feel the great cool air and to hear the sounds on the street. We could hear the clippity-clop of horse drawn carriages and the sound of the trolley. I found it charming. I know others find the train loud and annoying. I guess it depends on your room location. We were on the 6th floor of the Seaport Tower with a view of the Navy ship. If you are a light sleeper you might want to ask to be in a room that does not face the train tracks. We were not bothered at all, but I did talk with other guests who were. Overall this was a great first visit to San Diego. We saw the San Diego Zoo, the San Diego Wild Animal Park and SeaWorld.

Later that night they showed a movie in one of the conference rooms and had a pop corn machine, but this seemed to be catered more to the little ones. The parking, as everyone else has mentioned, ran $22 a day for self parking and $32 for valet. The self parking garage is attached to the hotel and access in and out was a breeze. Petco Park is a nice stroll past the Convention Center (less then a mile) from the hotel and is an extremely safe walk at night, just mind the pedi-cabs as there are plenty of those and if you don't pay attention you may meet one unexpectedly. If you are going to the game, check to see if the Hotel is running there All-Star Deal, where if there are any home runs hit during the game you can receive discounts on your stay. Behind the hotel near the water is a great little shopping area where you can get pretty inexpensive food and drinks. If you need any incidentals, about a mile from the hotel is a grocery store called Ralph's which carries anything you may need, just ask the desk for directions. I took the walk myself at night, and although it seemed pretty safe and the area is very clean, there were your share of homeless in the area, (not a lot, but enough to notice) but not one of them bothered me. Still, the walk was pleasant. La Jolla was only 15 minutes away with some great kayaking, The San Diego Zoo (fantastic/all day event) was about the same, and Mission Beach had a great boardwalk with rides and games.

I had read a lot of negative reviews before traveling to this hotel and I am not sure exactly where all those negative people stayed, but it obviously was not anywhere near where we stayed. Maybe they have separate wing for rude and negative people and they put them alI together so they have something to complain about.

The rooftop bar is a perfect location to watch a sunset, but a glass of wine approaches $10. The maids charged us for simply moving some bottles in the minibar fridge to chill a bottle of champagne.

We also noticed when we got to the room that it smelled terrible--someone had been smoking there recently and a lot. I was reading that card that said \"this is a no-smoking room\" as I called the front desk to ask what had happened. May we change rooms? No other rooms available. We'll send a guy; he'll fix the smoke. So sorry. Their guy shows up with a can of spray something, and assured us it will be better when we get back from dinner. It was 50 minutes until our dinner reservations, so we went to the bar on the 40th floor. Great location. Sat at a window table, and no one noticed us for twenty minutes. So I got up, and the waitress finally came over. She took our orders. Fifteen minutes later she came back and said \"What did you order?\" I told her again, and she brought it ten minutes later. I chugged my beer, we ate some of the bread and cheese, but left most of it (about $35.00 for one beer, one glass of wine, and a plate of bread and cheese). No time. My wife took her wine and we carried it down the elevator and out to the hotel's restaurant which is not attached to the hotel (Sally's). The restaurant was fine. The food was excellent, but the atmosphere was very loud. Marble floors, marble tables, loud silverware, no tablecloths etc. Not intimate at all. We asked for the chef's table as advertised on the website, but the concierge had never heard of it, nor had the restaurant. We were placed on a small but long table near everyone else. No big deal, but nothing special. We returned to the room, the guy with the can had placed some kind of air machine near the bed which remained there all night. Helped with the smoke. The lamp next to the bed was unplugged (had been when we got there) and there was no place to plug it in that I could see, even after moving the furniture. Then I turned on the television. No reception. So I moved the television and found the cable and screwed it back in to the TV. In summary, nice hotel in the big picture, but this \"executive suite\" is an insult.

I wish I had known that there was a newer wing to the hotel; that there was a beautiful pool area above the lobby that we never knew existed because we assumed the pool we saw from our window was the main pool area. The main pool area is exquisite! I wish I had know a coke from the hotel bar would be $4 and parking in the hotel would be $17/night. Overall, San Diego turned out to be a little more expensive than I expected. Being from Boston, it's hard for me to get sticker shocked, but at times, I was; e.g. $24 for a pizza at Village Pizzaria in Coronado and a $7 eclair from the Hotel Del Coronado. I regret not trying the buffet at Lael's, a restaurant located in the hotel. Overall, I would definitely recommend the Manchester Grand Hyatt if you want to be close to it all.

The southern view, however, is much better if you are on the outside of the building, and there is less noise and street traffic. The rooms are okay, but lack some of the amenities touted on the website and some things show lack of attention to detail... (non-working desk phones in both of the rooms I had makes me wonder if that is a coincidence or the norm). It seems the recession has slowed business down and a staff member told me that renovations are being deferred until business picks up again. The location is nice, although the touristy Seaport Village that surrounds the place seems mostly closed due to the economy and time of year. The food is very good. We ate in Sally's Seafood on the Water and it was quite a delicious lunch. The restaurant, however, was empty. Going to try Top of the Hyatt on the 40th floor tonight and see how that is. Impressive lobby and first floor. The rooms are pretty much standard-issue Hyatt. Fast elevators, which is nice, although this is hardly full occupancy, so I guess that is not a good time to determine elevator speed. The owner was a vocal supporter of Prop 8 in California and that has prevented some groups and conventions from staying at the hotel. Possibly that explains the lack of business as compared to the much more bustling hotels in the area. Overall, it is fine.

The rooms are thoroughly cleaned each day - I saw the maid actually scrubbing down the wall of my shower. I like the triple sheeting and 6 pillows. Room service was fast, and a big cheeseburger with all the fixins' and huge serving of fries cost $24, including tip. (I do wish they'd brought a glass of water, though.) Sally's had a great chicken sandwich and blackened tuna. There is the problem of the one cup at a time coffee maker. I didn't even bother getting a key to the mini bar refrigerator with its $10 a day restocking fee if you use it for your own stuff. I did end up buying one of the $4.50 bottles of water because I don't like the taste of the tap water in San Diego. The spa is a good deal if you feel like some pampering. My one hour massage also bought me an afternoon with the steam shower, jacuzzi, a private lap pool and dried fruit and water while lounging in the sun and shade with a book. I could have ordered pool side food and drink, too. The hotel backs up to Seaport Village, a beautiful park and shopping area. (My husband and I bought hats, ate a couple of meals. ) The first day I came, there was an art show along the shore. Just across Harbor Drive is the Gaslamp area with shopping and tons of unique restaurants. (Enjoyed meals at Osetra with their wine fairies and La Bocca.) There's a Ralph's grocery 5 blocks from the hotel. Watch out for the pedicabs - $30 a person if you don't haggle. The shuttle from the airport cost me $8 one way.

When we joined them over the weekend, my parents were told that the Hyatt would try to accomdate us in a room next to their room. Apparently, the person in the next room was a late check out and there some coordination problems with housekeeping so we ended up waiting almost three hours to get a room. We checked back with the front desk periodically and it was frustrating to be told that it would just take a few minutes longer. To their credit, the front desk was always polite. We were trying to be patient since we had been promised a great room next to my parents. Finally after two 1/2 hours I called housekeeping directly to find out what was going on. To make a long story short, after three hours, we took a room three doors down with the same gorgeous Bay View and a King size bed. With two kids in tow, we would have preferred double beds but we managed. Room service is pricey but the food was pretty good and delivered quickly. It is true that the elavators are a bit slow but the place is incredibly busy! I would have preferred a bigger and less crowded pool too. Otherwise, service was fine. Sally's by the Bay serves an incredible and reasonably priced brunch on Sundays from 10-3. They even have a great kids menu.

The lobby area is beautiful but when you reach the elevator area, there's a stench of what seems to be a water/sewer issue. We noticed it on each floor. The rooms are rather small and ready for some updating. The carpet was dirty but the view was nice and the bed was comfortable. There's a sign in the bathroom indicating that linens are only replaced upon request in order to conserve water and energy which is a great idea. However, the housekeeping was somewhat lacking. We had dirty glassware left in our room day after day. We even tried setting it on the floor in the hallway but there it stayed. We occupied our room for six nights and not once was the room vacuumed. There was also an awful smell each time we turned on the bathroom sink - like sewage. The Bellmen were very helpful and courteous. The staff at the Concierge desk were also very knowledgeable. The pool is nice but definitely in need of more shade. There are a few cabanas but other than that, no shady areas for those who need to avoid the sun. We attended the July 4th BBQ and while the food was tasty, it was mayhem. They ran out of several items in the first few minutes and the line backed up. I used the workout room and it was extremely state of the art and clean.

Before staying here, we researched what others on this website had to say. The Manchester Grand Hyatt hotel was a very pleasant experience. Fabulous location, location, location. Our room was very nicely appointed, but was not a suite. But then, we did not book or pay for a suite. We were very happy with our room. We stayed on the 30th floor of the older tower. Views? OMG! Beds and pillows- were great. Room was great-just remember- we did not pay for, or stay in a suite. This review is for a standard room. Hospitality and Personnel- excellent and friendly. If you, like us, want to bring a cooler of some kind, and some groceries- un-like other hotels we've stayed at- you will not be looked down upon. We stayed on July 4th. A very busy day for all water front locations in this area. We booked our room- using hotwire.com and paid a measly $159. for our room (prior to tax). Truly a deal and 1/2. My one caveat, is that I wanted to use the spa-and was told ahead of time, that day usage of the spa for a hotel guest would cost $10. We went to the spa, and we were told it would now cost $25. HUH, over a 24 hour period the cost went up 2 and 1/2 times? Apparently YES. I did ask for the manager, told her I'd been quoted $10. for a full day of the spa \"yesterday\", she explained that yes-management had increased the charge to $25. However, she would honor the $10. we'd been quoted the day before. (hurumph-well I should think so). In regards to the spa. The men's and women's are separate, each has a sauna, steam room, lockers and bathrooms separate. Together-there are lounging areas, a private pool and spa (no kiddies allowed). A wonderfull pool and jacuzzi area with views to die for overlooking the bay, the boats and the ocean. Truly worth it, if it's a busy time, and you don't want to be around children. The workout room, cost a gues $5.00. But- it is pretty impressive and worth the money for sure. The hotel itself- the lobby, the bars, the restaurants and the gift shops- are all well appointed, with fabulous artwork- fixtures, flat screen TV's and great service. IF- you happen to go on July 4th. I don't think there is a better place to see Fireworks in all of San Diego. Even my \"I really don't care about Firework's\" hubby was impressed with the show that was put on. We would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat. PS: If you're into sailing- right in front of the hotel (on the water) you can rent a 25' Catalina Sailboat for two hours for $108. For breakfast- mosey over to the Edgewater Cafe. Great people watching, reasonable food, right on the water. For dinner- We would recommend: \"Roy's Asian Fusion Cusine\" less expensive then \"Sally's\" way better, and world famous. *But, make an early reservation for Roy's.

The bathroom did not have the curved shower rod. I can't remember staying in a hotel in the past few years without this feature so I felt claustrophobic when I took my shower. Perhaps other rooms in the hotel had been updated but not my room. The second complaint which many others have mentioned is the noise from the trolley/train. It is definitely noticeable in the room. I'm not a light sleeper so it did not bother me but I can see how others may have a hard time falling asleep or waking up due to the noise. I used the gym on two occasions. One of the nicer hotel gyms I've used. Not only does it have a good selection of aerobic type equipment but it also has many free weights and weight-lifting equipment as well which I rarely find in hotel gyms.

It's within walking distance to Seaport Village, the harbor, the convention center, the trolley station, and even the Gaslamp district. Unfortunately the hotel does not offer a free airport shuttle. I noticed that several other hotels in the area do offer free airport shuttles. Cab fare to the airport was about $11. This is definitely a business/convention hotel. There were several meetings going on while I was there, along with the accompanying crowds. Even then, I think it is family-friendly and I would enjoy staying here for vacation. I would stay here again if visiting San Diego.", "Date": "April 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "CA", "Title": "\u201cWATCH YOUR BILL !!!

Our 8 year old daughter came with us. This is a pretty new hotel (5 years?), and the style is very traditional/Versailles/English country manor, which normally I don't care for, but they do it well and lots of other folks love that style, so if you do, you'll love the hotel that much more. Staff was lovely except for when we initially arrived, which was late in the evening. We had been confirmed a king bed with rollaway but were told that only double bed rooms were available. A couple of stern looks and statements later, and we got a nice king room on the 19th floor with a rollaway, which was high quality rollaway, not just a cot. Unfortunately, we had to move furniture ourselves and set up the bed ourselves, but we decided better to just get it done than wait and have to tip someone else (attention hotel management!). Also, there were not enough towels nor were there robes on our arrival. A call to housekeeping resulted in delivery of robes and a mountain of extra towels within 15 minutes. The cleaners did a great job and were very sweet to us during our stay. However, a colleague staying in the other tower (Seaport) commented on a distinct lack of cleaning of her room during our stay. Our room looked out to the other tower and over the pool, and we could see the navy yards across the bay and the ocean, and also trains and trolleys. We would recommend this hotel for people with kids because there's so much transportation to see just from the windows: aircraft carriers coming and going, commuter trains, freight trains, F5s, helicopters, commercial jets, trollies, pedicabs, etc. If you have one of those kids who likes to watch things that move, this is the hotel for you! On that note, let us comment that YES, the train will wake you up in the middle of every night, always at different times!! The horn is very loud, even on the higher floors. It was only a minor nuisance for us, though, and we always fell right back to sleep. The only other weird thing about our room was a distinct lack of hot water pressure, even in the shower--I swear I haven't been in such a large hotel where you're taking a shower and the water starts to turn cold after 15 minutes. And there was almost no water pressure at all in the sink (attention hotel management again! room 1902!) Now for the amenities: gorgeous gym with 24 hour access and personal trainers onsite. There is a nice spa, though we did not partake. The pool area has 2 jacuzzis, and people seemed to be pretty considerate about monitoring kids. You can see the ocean from the pool area. The breakfast buffet is very pricey, but very comprehensive, good for a fancy Sunday brunch. For cheaper breakfast, you can go just to the courtyard outside for a starbuck's type place owned by the hotel. Even that is a bit pricey, so if you walk literally 2-3 blocks away you can find much cheaper local places. Also there's a Ralph's supermarket about a 5-10 minute walk away, so we stocked up on fruits and snacks to keep on hand. Also fun is the Top of the Hyatt bar lounge on the 40th floor, with nice panoramic views, and it's OK to bring you kids up there for a Shirley Temple while you unwind with a beer before setting out in search of dinner! Seaport Village is right next door, if you like that kind of thing, and it is nice to walk all along the harbor from the hotel up to the Midway. And if you have to be at the convention center, you walk out of the hotel, past the Marriott and there you are (< 1/2 mile). Parking is NOT included, self-park is $20 a day, valet $28 with unlimited in-out, and the valets were lovely--very helpful and it never took more than 10 minutes after a call from our room to get the car--most times it was waiting for us by the time we got out. Concierges were a bit fussy, but helpful. Our impression there is that there may not be enough of them and they may start to feel overwhelmed. Also, they will tend to only guide you the \"tourist way\" to destinations, but if you're like us and more adventurous, you will have to get the insider info elsewhere.

Good tip - check the specials the hotel offers (as we had buffet breakfast free with our room) and do join their Gold Passport program. Prior to arriving, we were offered Hyatt e-concierge services (we requested a quiet room with a nice view and extra pillows). WOW - they put us on the 24th floor, in a corner room for $152/night! Room was pretty standard - but the views were magnificent! Also had a window that opened for fresh air. Hotel service is outstanding throughout. Used valet parking - and car was always ready with a 5 minute notice - plus the attendants gave good directions (that were quick and precise). The fitness center is on the 4th floor with top of the line, current cardio machines, free weights, and exercise areas. Some treadmills have direct views of the bay (cool to watch cruise ships and navy helicopters coming & going). Pool area also has two jacuzzi hot tubs plus gas powered firepits, and beautiful harbor and city views. Downtown location is close to everything - plus the airport (under 10 minutes away).

And, Seaport Village might be a bit \"touristy\", but it is a great place to people watch and spend the day. There were several street performers; a magician, a few palm readers, and even a nice woman selling home made tye-dye shirts.

(Bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper.) These trains affect ALL hotels that are in this harbor/ waterfront area, so there is not much you can do to avoid it if you need to be near the convention center.

This hotel is in a great location with beautiful views of the bay and marinas and within walking distance of Seaport Village (parks, music, affordable eateries), downtown\u2019s famous Gaslamp District, the Midway (retired aircraft carrier \u2013 open to the public), and a short ferry ride to Coronado Island. It\u2019s also located a reasonably short taxi ride away from Balboa Park and the San Diego Zoo (both of which, I recommend highly). The Hyatt\u2019s entrance is \u201cgrand\u201d and the lobby and restaurants/bars contained therein are all beautiful and immaculate. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t say the same about the rooms. The hotel hallways, rooms and room d\u00e9cor/furnishings are about the same size and quality as a roadside Comfort Inn or Hampton Inn (the exception was that the bed and bedding were very comfortable). In addition, the room\u2019s walls and windows are paper thin, and as a result, the sound of slamming doors, running water, televisions, conversations, hallway traffic, outdoor trains and automobile traffic were ubiquitous. I also want to add that I felt that I was being nickled and dimed by this hotel. I'm used to using a long distance access card (toll-free number) for free, but the Hyatt charges $1.00 per call. In addition, they charge $9.95 for each 24 hour connection to the internet. With regard to the room service, the unusually limited selection was not just overpriced (like most hotels), but ridiculously overpriced...especially when you add the $3.00 delivery charge and the required 21 percent gratuity to the price of the meal. For example, after all was said and done, my waffle and cranberry juice breakfast cost just over $29.00. And, with regard to laundry, getting my suitcase-wrinkled shirts pressed cost $7.75 each. With regard to the service, I will say that each Hyatt employee I dealt with was earnest and kind. There were a few problems for which the hotel personnel bent over backwards to remedy \u2013 which in the end, they did. However, I don\u2019t want to overstate these problems.

Room service was overpriced but I'm not sure when/where it's not. Sounds good overall, except for one thing...... It's darn near impossible to get any sleep there due to noise! The hotel has the unfortunate location of being directly next to train tracks. The trains blast their horn as a warning for the pedestrian crossing that they traverse. What this means is that every hour or so throughout the night there's a ridiculously loud train horn blasting into the room (even in rooms on the upper floors where I was.). It was so ridiculous that it was comical at first, however upon not being able to sleep it got really old, really fast. (I definitely wouldn't consider myself a light sleeper.) The hotel windows are cheap, thin, single-pane construction. I'd imagine if the hotel were to sink money into nicely constructed double-pane windows the noise would be diminished by quite a bit. They've chosen not to however and the guests are left to deal with this. After the first night of noise I asked the concierge where I could buy some earplugs. Without hesitation she reached into a drawer and pulled some out. I'm fairly certain that this a frequent request and one that Hyatt should be a bit embarrassed about.

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and can't for the life of me understand the negativity of some of the other reviewers. This hotel is beautiful! Check in was very efficient. I arrived at noon and was given a room without any problem, even though it was several hours before stated check in. I requested a room in the Seaport tower with a bay view and was not charged extra for this. What a fantastic view of the bay and the ships passing by! One window does actually open, which was great because I love fresh air. However, it's very noisy at night and had to close it over night....trains, horns! The walls must be pretty thin because I could hear jazz music blaring from the room next door which kept me from falling asleep one night. I called the desk and within 15 minutes the music had stopped. The rooms have been recently renovated- comfy pillow top bedding with lots of pillows, new carpeting...very clean. The rooms have an ipod docking station/alarm clock, which I thought was wonderful. Housekeeping was very efficient and our room was made up daily. I ordered room service for breakfast twice and was delighted each time. Pricey with a $3 delivery charge and a 21% room service charge (including tip) but it was very convenient and delicious. The food was a great temperature and received within a half hour of placing the order both times. They even delivered one morning to the 4th floor pool deck where I was enjoying the beautiful San Diego weather. I also had brunch in the hotel restaurant, which was very good. They have a fantastic buffet with omelets made to order. The rest of the meals we had outside of the hotel. There are many casual dining restaurants within an easy walking distance, especially in the Seaport village located directly behind the hotel. There is everything from order-at-the-window tacos and margaritas, hot dogs, etc. to fine sit down dining overlooking the bay. We had a really nice dinner at the Harbor House in the Seaport village, which is right on the boardwalk by the bay. Expensive, everything is ala carte, but very good. Our favorite restaurant was Anthony's, located between the Midway and the Star of India on the boardwalk. I had the Sea Bass one night and the California spiny lobster another night...salad, bread and side included for under $30. I didn't see prices like this anywhere else in the gas lamp or Seaport Village. I did not rent a car and would not recommend doing so unless you need it to travel outside of the city. Everything worth seeing is within a few miles. Taxis are always readily available at the front of the hotel with reasonable fares. Taxi fare one way from the airport was $12. I understand there was a daily charge of $20 for parking a car. The shops at the Seaport Village were fantastic, also good shopping at the Horton Plaza. I liked Seaport Village because the shops were so unique. Horton Plaza had stores that you see in any mall. I really enjoyed just walking up and down the boardwalk. A lot of activity with T-shirt and jewelry vendors, there were several cruise ships that were docked while we were there. Lots of military ships passing and the navy seals were always active. My only complaint was the large number of homeless people that literally littered the beautiful park areas adjacent to the boardwalk. It would have been nice to sit on the benches for a while and watch the boats float by on the bay, but couldn't. Another reader said they were not approached by them, I was twice. I have to say it was very creepy walking down here at night, I wouldn't recommend it. My Mom took a tour of the Midway while I was at my conference and she really enjoyed it. I would also highly recommend the Trolley Tour. Tickets are $30 and available at any of the trolley stops (one in Seaport Village). The tour is 2 hours if you don't get off and is fully narrated. There are stops at the Zoo, the museum district, the cruise ship terminal, Old Town and Coronado Island. We got off in Old Town, which had a lot of shopping and had a great lunch at Baja Rockin' Lobster. We also got off in Coronado Island which had great shopping as well and went through the hotel Del Coronado. We went through the back of the hotel and sat on the beautiful white sand beach and watched the Pacific surf. I was told the sunset from there was out of this world. I spent a lot of time on the 4th floor pool area, which was beautiful. Decent sized pool, 2 hot tubs and cushioned lounge chairs. Chairs were hard to come by at midday, but available. There were beautiful views of down town San Diego and the Bay from up here. There was not anywhere to get food or drinks by the pool but there were phones where you could call to have something delivered. In fact the only place where you could get a bottle of water or a soft drink was in the gift shop in the Harbor Tower. There are no beverage machines located anywhere in the hotel. I would also highly recommend going to the 40th floor of the Harbor Tower and have a drink at the Top of the Hyatt. The views here were fantastic!

But on a trip this month, I felt it was slipping a bit much like the days before the remodel. This hotel is perfectly fine for a business stay, but for those looking for a getaway, you may want to consider elsewhere. Here are some things to know: Arrival and Front Desk - All of the staff was pleasant and efficient. I could overhear all of the front desk staff giving the same sales pitch to upgrade rooms \"for only $20 additional dollars a night\", this was in response to the fact that all of us requested king beds but could only be given doubles. The person who helped me gave me room keys, but forgot to have them coded for my room so they didn't work. She also forgot to give me a key to the mini bar, so I called down for it later. Rooms -- Beds are well appointed with new linens, down comforter, etc. However the room had several little things wrong with it - the internet connection did not work and the outlets by the desk did not work consistently, so I had to sit on the bed and plug in there. They do not provide robes at this hotel, which I still don't understand. I requested one and received a very shabby and stained robe. It had nail polish all over the front of it. A robe isn't a necessity for everyone, but it is standard at any 4 and most 3-star hotels. The hairdryer worked, but the switch was broken, so you had to jiggle it for the dryer to come on. The bathroom was clean, but the grout is very stained and needs redone and sealed in black so that it doesn't appear so dirty (in this case it ws white grout around the edges of the room that slowly darkened to black where a person stands at the sink) I reported the electrical issues, but they weren't able to fix them during my stay. Fitness Center - The Fitness Center could be outstanding, but everyone I spoke to agreed it misses the mark. It's open 24 hours which is excellent, but there is only about a 10x10 space to do any stretching or ab work. There are TV monitors set up at each cardio machine, but they did not work. Every day the attendant would say \"they are being installed tonight\" but the next day it was just the same condition. What made this worse is that the machines faced windows which overlooked the bay, but due to the 17 inch blank screen in front of you, you couldn't enjoy the view. Restaurants - Here is where they Hyatt has done well. They have a variety of restaurants and lounges to choose from and they are all good quality with a variety of options. Sally's is a nice spot that feels separate from the hotel, even though it's not. All in all, this is still one of the better Hyatts, but I think they need to stay dedicated to keeping the rooms in good shape and aim to make the room amenities features of the room instead of detractors.

Unexplained long wait and no response when I asked what the problem was. Also the room rate included complimentary breakfast, but he said he didn't know anything about it and told us to come back later for vouchers. The vouchers we eventually got ended up being pretty much useless anyways because the lines at the restaurant were over an hour long. The real problem started when I asked Housekeeping to bring me a set of towels and other customary hospitality items for an extra (paid) guest. What I received were two tightly stacked water glasses that could not be separated and two bath towels in one of which I later found a stranger's p*b*c hair. When I called Housekeeping to complain about the hair in the towel, the operator hung up on me mid-sentence and didn't pick up the phone on my second attempt. I was able to reach Housekeeping a few minutes later. Shortly thereafter, there was a loud knock on the door- it was a maid asking what time we'll be checking out. It was barely 10AM at this time, and the stated check-out time was 12 Noon (we had already had another maid knocking only an hour earlier at which time we discovered the room didn't have a do-not-disturb sign). We figured things could go only worse and decided to leave the premises immediately, especially because my brother, who had just come back after having tried to get some breakfast and getting tired of endless waiting, just wanted to go somewhere to eat in peace. On the way out, a hotel personnel who showed me the location of express check-out asked me how my stay was. So prompted, I briefly mentioned the hair in the towel and being driven out by the hourly visits by the maids. He was horrified by these events that \"should never have happened\" and insisted that I wait to speak with a manager. However, when an assistant manager saw me, the tune changed immediately. The assistant manager said, although Hyatt guests would normally be compensated for the type of experience we were subjected to, there was really nothing he could do and advised me to speak with Expedia- \"people who book through third parties are not Hyatt guests,\" according to him. No, sympathy, no apologies, and no assurances of following up with housekeeping! Only after I became loud and belligerent upon being incited by his comment, did this assistant manager remember to apologize for my experience.

The hotel is huge and is in a great spot. It's on the bay across from Coronado Island. The rooms were very comfortable and big enough for 3 people to move around in. The bathroom also was a bit bigger, with a separate cupboard to put your toiletries in (rather than bunching them up near the sink). The bedding was wonderful! It was a down comforter and pillows so soft that I'm going to order some for my home. the staff here was extremely nice and helpful in giving you directions, helping you get a cab, etc. the poolside area on the 4th floor was huge, with a lot of lawn furniture, cabanas, a bar, restaurant, children's area where they could get toys, fire pits and foosball and ping pong tables. given that it was a huge hotel, the pool area was always crowded. a nice size margarita by the pool was $9 -- about what i expected. the workout room, which overlooks the ocean, is also on the 4th floor near the pool. the equipment was a bit older but it did the trick. they provided dry towels and cold wet towels for guests and a water cooler. they were supposed to charge for using the fitness room, but no one was ever there to take my name, so i didn't pay. out behind the hotel is Seaport Village, which is a bunch of restaurants and shops along the boardwalk and next to the park. it's a nice place to shop and eat. plenty of variety. the park and boardwalk are also nice to walk and run in in the mornings. In the summer, they have orchestra concerts by the water. it's only $12 for lawn seats. That's also where you'll find a lot of the tours of the city to sign up for. we went into the Maritime Museum on the aircraft carrier. I'm not a big military buff, but I thought it was pretty cool and worth the $15 entry fee. The Gaslamp district of shops, bars and restaurants is a short walk. that's a pretty cool place to go too. It's also by the regular mall, which wasn't all that impressive. it looks a lot bigger than it actually is. There's a place in there (Rocco's maybe?) where you can get a manicure and pedicure for $30 total! granted it's not the luxurious spa experience but, if you're looking just to pamper your feet and hands for a while, it's not bad. that service is $95 at the Hyatt's spa. I would skip Old Town unless you're looking to kill some time. It was just a bunch of the same shops you can see in Seaport Village but in an old town setting. One of the locals told us Old Town is under new management who isn't taking care of it and it might shut down anyway. We also took a trip to Ensenada, Mexico. It was ok. Our tour guide/bus driver wasn't that good, so we didn't learn much about the areas we went through. However, my aunt took the same trip 2 years ago and loved it. She said her tour guide was great that time. So I guess it's a coin toss. We took the pedicabs a few times too. Those are fun but they're looking to rip off tourists. Don't pay more than $10 for a ride. We found that when one person told us it was $20, another would come up and ask us what we wanted to pay. We never paid over $10. There are a lot of homeless people in San Diego and many line the boardwalk outside Seaport Village. They never said anything though and seemed harmless.

Let's get right to the Travel Duck tips: 1. There are two towers - the Seaport Tower (built 2004) and Harbor Tower (built 1992). I have stayed in both towers and highly recommend the newer Seaport Tower. The front desk person was very helpful in finding us a room with a great view in the Seaport Tower. 2. The hotel charges $20/day for self park and $28/day for valet. Self Park is a pain as you have to go to at least the third level to find a spot. I would choose valet next time for the extra few bucks a day. 3. In San Diego, you must have a \"fish taco.\" I recommend Baja Rockin Lobster in the GasLamp district on 5th Street. 4. For the best breakfast in San Diego, try Kona's on Pacific Beach at the Pier. The line is long but moves quick. and you will be full all morning. 5. There are often long lines at the hotel upon check in. However, if you are a Gold Passport member you can go to a special line - saves precious beach time. 6. You can walk from the hotel to Gas Lamp district (10 minutes); Petco Park (15 minutes); or Seaport Village (2 minutes). You can also take a bicycle cab - no need to call one since 20 of them will harass you when you leave the front door. 7. The hotel pool is very nice but it was tough to find a chair. Get there early. And, to the nice gentleman smoking a cigar which blew all over the pool area - I suggest the Cigar Bar in Gas Lamp Quarter. 8. I found the bellman from Baltimore (forgot his name) very helpful - he even printed me out directions to In and Out Burger. All the staff were very pleasant. 9. Are you still reading? Aren't you bored yet? If you want more San Diego tips feel free to ask.

Seaport Village is right outside the hotel, so there are no worries about parking if you park at the hotel garage (expensive, but in/out privileges handy). The regular room we were in looked to be recently remodeled, at least where bedding and furniture was. The bathroom needed some help, especially the toilet, as the one in there was way beyond its useful life. It looked ok, but flushed horribly and it took over a half hour for the tank to fill. The people that worked there were very friendly, especially at the concierge desk. There was always a line but they pushed it through quickly so the wait was not long. The cleaning people mostly kept to themselves and were slow. We came back to our room at 4 pm and it still was not made up. I saw one of the ladies who cleans rooms on that floor and just asked her for more towels and shampoo because I ended making the bed myself. She did not speak English so I just pointed to what I wanted on her cart. She was nice and smiled a lot. Her smile was catchy! She was probably happy that she didn't need to do our room, but at least she understood English. When we got back each evening from the Gaslamp District, we had \"movie night\" in our room through the hotel's television. Movies are cheap - cheaper than going to a theater. Room service is excellent (as I've found typical in Hyatts) and we watched movies at night to wind down from our busy day. I love how you can pause a movie in case you need to answer the door (when midnight snacks are delivered). It rewinds about the last 10 seconds so you do not miss anything. Hyatt's movies are latest releases too, some not yet available on DVD. Gaslamp District is within walking distance, maybe a 15 minute walk. The Gaslamp website includes this Hyatt in their list of hotels, which is a bit deceiving for someone not used to walking. The concierge suggested cabbing it instead of walking it. We cabbed it there to meet our reservation times one day, but walked back. The great thing is the safety factor. The area is well lit and feels very safe. Certain streets are very crowded and you can tell that food is the main reason people go there. So many restaurants and bars compared to shopping places. We spent many hours walking around at night.

We were asked to show ID, although the greeter did not ask ID for the couple who entered just before us. I had a Massachsuetts driver's license, and my husband had a French passport. This is where it got interesting. The greeter said that he could let me in but could not accept the foreign passport because it did not include weight, a required a physical descriptive according to California law. We responded that the Massachusetts license didn't list weight either and that didn't seem to be a problem for him, and he basically said \"well, I've seen those licenses before and I know where that's coming from.\" There were a number of things that disturbed us about this experience. It seemed ridiculous that a French passport is valid to get past customs and into the country but apparently not into the Top of the Hyatt lounge. The provincial attitude of the greeter was insulting and in striking contrast to the Hyatt's self-promoted image as a world-class hotel. It also was evident that the policy was being applied unfairly and arbitrarily -- we wouldn't have had a problem if the greeter checked ID on everyone, but he clearly was picking and choosing to be difficult with us. We did complain to the manager who apologized for the experience. We later found 2 small bottles of Evian and 3 chocolate-covered strawberries delivered to our room.

After 5 days in L.A., we decided to drive down to San Diego for a 3 day getaway. We are from the East Coast and this was our first time in California. I researched a lot of hotels before deciding on this one. I did read reviews about the train noise, so when booking I brought this to the customer service rep and she immediately put me on hold to verify this with the Hotel. She came back on the line and I was told honestly that the train noise can be heard on the lower floors but faintly on the higher floors. My request was made and noted that we would like a room on as high as floor as possible. I recieved an email confirmation stating this - also stating the room would be $299 night. I forgot to state that I am a government employee and would like the government rate. Within 24 hours I got an updated corrected price of $180/night - quite a difference. I would need to bring proof of my govt. employment, etc.. which I did at sign in with no problems. Once there we were impressed with the huge lobby area and great location and views from our window. We were given the 24th floor and did not hear any train sounds at all - and I am a light sleeper. Views of water, boats, etc... were wonderful. I read a review about Lael's buffet - which was fantastic for breakfast and one night for the Italian buffet - yes, it was pricey - but my two children were told they would be given the half price discount without my even asking about it. They are ages 11 and 16 - so not terribly young. Waitors, and the hotel staff in general were very happy to assist and were very friendly. There were always taxi's waiting if you needed one. Rooms were spacious enough and clean. One thing I did not like was that you had to pay to use the work-out room. It was extremely beautiful and had great machines - but I always feel it should be included. I think it was $10 for 2/3 days - not a lot - but should be free !! Other than that - hotel was what we thought it would be and had a great trip !!

And she again said no. I then said, there has to be someone in the hotel who can get them to me... you are charging me to hold them are you not? She said yes and I said to her... well then I should be able to get them whenever I need them. (I needed them that night) She said she would try to get them to me. I had told her I needed a book and some papers that were in one of the boxes. She was able to get the boxes with the help of security and when they delivered them to me she said... \"these boxes sure look like paper to me\" as she rolled her eyes and gave me this ugly stare. I told her that I understood she was having to go out of her way to get these boxes for me and that I appreciated her efforts, but she had no right to talk to me like that. I told her I was paying for the boxes and that I should be able to get them anytime I wanted them. I asked her if she wanted me to open them up for her so she could see the papers I needed and she just remained silent. I called down to the manager on duty and he said she must have not meant what she said! Nice apology huh? This hotel needs a lesson on service! Would I stay here again...

VERY INCONVENIENT, and could have been avoided had they honored our reservation request. The beds, in and of themselves, weren't as uncomfortable as I had gathered from other reviews.

There wasn't a coffee maker in the room, unless it was in the mini-bar that was locked (why lock up the coffee?).

It is on the boardwalk, ten minute walk from the Gaslight, close to the airport, and in a safe neighborhood.

Pros: Location Nice staff; everybody was helpful and cheerful Pretty lobby Mostly quiet (see below) in the rooms; you hear the usual doors slamming, hallway conversations and running water, but it's no worse than anywhere else Quick, plentiful elevators Rooms are decent size The brunch in the hotel restaurant was good, and expensive as expected, but a nice splurge. The waiter was incredibly solicitious and pleasant, and made the experience relaxing and enjoyable. Cons Expensive for what you get; the rooms are dated and a bit shabby. There is no indoor pool; although there is a lovely outdoor pool and sunning area, we couldn't use it and my bathing suit sat unused in my suitcase, Not so quiet at 6:00 am when the helicopters from the Naval Ships stationed nearby hover above the water and the tugboats blast their horns Does many functions at once; meetings, weddings, charity events, so you may come at a busy time and not get the room you requested. I almost didn't get a nonsmoking room; a tip from the check-in guy is call the day before and specifically request the room you want to be reserved for you. It also can get chaotic with all these events and get very loud and crowded in public areas. We couldn't get to the bar on the 40th floor at any time during our stay because it was so crowded we were turned away. Everything is expensive, a diet coke and lemonade were eight bucks. The water in the room is 6 bucks (walk to Starbucks across the street, it is 2.75 there for a bottle of water). My own personal gripes: The toiletries smell weird. I don't know what's in them, but they really stink. Bring your own stuff. On the day of checkout, the housekeeper tried to open the door while I was getting dressed, around 10am. Checkout is clearly stated on the back of the door as noon, yet somebody from the front desk came around 11:00 to ask when I might get around to checking out. If checkout is noon, don't bother me until after that. I have until noon, I've paid until noon, and unless you want to give me back some of my cash, the hotel can wait until I check out at noon. I thought that was really rude. The water pressure is low and the water is really soft (or is it hard? It is the one that makes you still feel soapy after you've rinsed off). I expected better.

It was a very busy weekend and seems like everyone was busy preparing for something big thats coming up. However, I was just there to have a relaxing weekend visiting San Diego For the first time. I did alot of the research online (including research here) and noticed there alot of the people refer to stay at a newer tower however people will charge you extra $ since its newer . In my case, I was pretty lucky that the check in guy offered me a complimentary upgrade to the new tower but did not offer me the regency club room since its all gone and he was saying there's not much difference besides the Flat screen TV. The Lobby is HUGE. One of the biggest hotel lobby I have ever seem. It IS pretty connecting 2 towers altogether. The Room we had was on the 24th floor, facing the ocean and the room size is OK, not big not small but the furniture is a bit WORN. The color of the room makes it seem really old and our biggest complain is the BED. Its to my understanding that Hyatt should be upgraded their mattress by now (as stated in their website). HOWEVER, the bed at this hotel was NOT upgraded. It is those mattress withOUT pillowtop, bad linen and the floral top bedspread (God I HATE this kind of bed, I have to give credits for Hilton Hotel for having such a wonderful bed which makes me doesn't want to wake up in the morning). And btw, their pillow is PRETTY flat too, like those u will get at the coach class flight. The shower room is just SO SO but I like their white ginger collection, they smells just right. The parking is easy with in&out previliages, the staffs are generally friendly but they certainly look understaffed and the staffs do complain about the lack of manpower in the hotel. The concerige recommended the \"Fish Market\" too. IT is a short walk from the hotel and it got a nice view of the bay, but the food is so so. I am from Orange County and for the price, I think u can find a better quality seafood (and more variety) at Market Broiler (in the Block of Orange), just to get u an idea how their seafood quality r like. However, the real Perk for this hotel is their buffet. They offered Friday night seafood and Sat BBQ and Sun Brunch. Whereas Sunday brunch is my favorite. They have the BEST oysters I had in buffets (Even better than those vegas buffet). They serve the TRUE restaurant quality seafood (go there if u eat tons of food and picky as I am). I think its better value to eat here than eating sunday brunch on the Hotel Del Mar on the Corona Island. THey aren't as all that as they seem. Being a historic hotel can not justify everything (esp the QUALITY, and their bathroom STINKS!!). Good Job for Hyatt for this part! They have a lovely jacuzzi and tennis court on 5th floor? Everyone should try that out. and I really, really hope that Hyatt would make an effort to listen to their customer's complain b/c my friend whom stayed at the Hyatt 2 wks ago (in vancouver) had problem with hsi rooms but management NEVER responded ever since. It seems like a common problem among the hyatt chain hotels. I was hoping to stay at Omnis but I had to stay where priceline would take me.

The hotel also offers complimentary compact refrigerators so call the front desk and get one to keep all your bottled water cool or for snacks.

I had pre-booked a non-smoking king bed, but was told it was unavailable when I arrived. I could take two single beds or upgrade (for $40) to a \"panoramic view\" room with a king. I chose the upgrade. It was a corner room, with a view of the bay and of the front of the hotel. The lobby is very beautiful, and the staff handling check-in was wonderful. (Staff was wonderful throughout my stay.) The room was a bit of a disappointment, as the carpet is getting old and one of three big windows was blocked by a wall. I had visited the Hyatt website right before the trip and was anticipating the new bed, six pillows, and iPod-ready radio-alarm clock... perhaps a flat screen LCD TV. None of these were present in my room. I ordered room service a few times, which arrived in a timely manner and was appealing. I ordered sausage with my breakfast one morning but got bacon. I called to let Room Service know and they offered to reduce the charge on the tab. When I checked out they had not done that, and no one associated with Room Service has any recollection of that offer. To their credit, they immediately reduced that charge by 25%. In-room internet was wireless, but required a credit card and could not be billed to the room. I wish all hotels offered free internet connections in every room. Charge for this was $9.95 per day. The area surrounding the hotel is great, and fun for exploring. I enjoyed visiting the KC Barbeque restaurant and bar directly across from the hotel, the site of filming the \"sleazy bar scene\" in Top Gun. It's teeny-tiny. I was on the 17th floor and happy I was not a floor below that. The previous reviews mention noise from the trains and they are LOUD. The trolley trains make a little noise as they come by, but the AMTRAK trains blow their VERY loud horns at each intersection. Because of the convergence of streets right at the hotel, there's at least two intersections the train has to go through right there. Some trains just gave a little blast but some engineers must have enjoyed really leaning on the horn! I will say that I was not disturbed in my sleep, though. Thick curtains?

I\u2019m going to include more than just the Hyatt in my report in the hope that you\u2019ll find the information useful. ORBITZ: I booked a complete package deal that included flight, hotel and rental car through Orbitz. A day after I made my booking I realized I could have save a little over $100 if I had booked the pieces individually through Orbitz. I notified Orbitz (because they advertised that I would save money by booking a package), while they were sympathetic, they said, \u201cthanks for letting us know, but we can\u2019t verify your claim\u201d, even though I could pull up put each piece (flight, car and room) add them together and show them they were less than the package I bought. They had no interest in verifying my claim, because they \u201chad no way to see each component\u201d from their computer. A manager finally did agree to either cancel my package so I could book the components individually, or send me a voucher for $100 off my next Orbits booking \u2013 like I\u2019m going to use them again\u2026. RENTAL CAR: Whatever you do not use Advantage Rental cars. They are a complete rip-off. It seems like they have only one bus that runs every hour, and the people are very unfriendly with long lines. I\u2019ve had personal problems with them and many people I\u2019ve spoken with have also had problems. I rented a car from Alamo. The people behind the desk were great, very friendly and helpful, but the car (Impala) was really dirty. I could barely see out of the windshield. HYATT: For the money (around $280+tax/night) for a standard room there are better hotels. The valets are very good, especially the guy in the suit \u2013 he\u2019s excellent. We arrived at 11:00 AM, had not trouble checking-in, and getting a room. The room was very typical \u2013 nothing special. While they advertise having two pools, one of the pools is for spa users only, so in reality you only have free use of one pool. I think it\u2019s absurd that they charge $10/24 hours for Internet service (wireless or hardwired). Especially when it\u2019s 802.11b at 11 mbps and my card only picked it up at 54%. Numerous times during my stay their access points went down and I lost my connection and my work (I should know better). After some discussion with the manager, he agreed to waive my charge for a day because of crashes. Still, considering the price of the room \u2013 Internet should be free, and reliable. Room service was fast and friendly, the food good, but a bit over priced. The workout room is adequate, but crowed in the morning \u2013 as you would expect. The Hyatt is a next to the train tracks so every night you\u2019ll hear a very loud train whistle at 3:00 AM \u2013 I\u2019m sure you can hear it at other hotels as well, but the Hyatt is right next to it so it\u2019s really loud. AREA RESTAURANTS: The concierge directed us to the Fish Market for dinner. (He claimed it was less expensive, less touristy and had a better menu than the restaurants in the Gaslamp district \u2013 he must get kick-backs, because it wasn\u2019t so.) It was OK \u2013 crowed, a little expensive and noisy with indifferent service. We waited in line at 20 minutes just to make a reservation and to get one of those electronic gadgets that lights up when your table is ready. We waited another 20 minutes after checking in with the hostess before a table was available. As a hint; you may want to go upstairs to the \u201cTop of the Market\u201d. There wasn\u2019t a line, and you can usually get seated immediately. The entrees are little more ($4-6 a plate), but the choices are greater and it\u2019s quieter. We also ate at Fred\u2019s Mexican Restaurant on Fifth Street; expensive and uninspired. Despite what they say on their menu, their meat is tough and unidentifiable.

The hotel has grown enormously, and in my view, most of the character has been sucked out of it. A lot of the orientation of the original hotel toward the harbor has been replaced with an orientation toward a vast front lobby that would fit in well in Las Vegas. The light, contemporary style of the hotel (which seemed perfect for the setting, to me), has been replaced with a very commonplace pseudo-traditional look, that might be more appropriate in Kansas City or Columbus rather than in a waterfront hotel in San Diego. The hotel was overbooked the night I stayed there. Many people in our convention were \"bumped\" to stay at a nearby hotel---I'm glad I checked in early to avoid this fate (since the meetings were all at the Hyatt). Despite my complaints about the remodeling of the hotel, there are some positives. Its in a great location, and that won't change. Plus, many of the otherwise ordinary rooms do have great views.

I think we only heard the train once, and even then we both asked eachother if we were sure we heard or just dreamed it. The room has lots of room and though the frig I requested, and never brought me, we managed to make room in the mini bar frig. The bed was somewhat comfy, but not what I was expecting from the pictures of a \"feather bed\". The sheets were nice. The bathroom had a nice shower head, but I must say that it definately shows it's age and resembles a bathroom in a Comfort Inn or Best Western. I can see how they added touches to try and avoid that appearence but they need to remodel all together. overall the room was comfortable with nice touches. The staff was very friendly and all very helpful and attentive. THe food was great! We ordered room service twice and while one night the guys ordered pizza from Domino's, I ordered a steak, with extra mashed potatos and creme brulee! We ate at the Buffet twice and enjoyed them both very much. We ate the breakfast buffet and I was very happy to see that they had the Dannon Lite-n-fit yogurt! (LA Weightloss friendly hotel!!). You get the usual options for the buffet and sweet fresh squeezed oj. We also ate at the Friday night seafood buffet. Pricy but worth it. The guys all had their fill of seafood and they mentioned that it tasted very fresh and good. I had my choice of salads and since I don't like fish, the chef at the buffet gladly tossed me up some pasta with a sauce minus the shrimp or lobster. I do like shrimp a little and I asked for a few shrimp just plained grilled. I got them just the way I asked. Since we had Regency Club (Concierge Level) we had our other breakfasts in there and it included everything except for the made to order omlettes. They always had cookies set out and for the night time they usually had cheeses and something hot like quesadilla rolls. Good stuff. We used them alot for the drinks. Saved alot of money! not having to buy them somewhere else and the goodies we took with us. Overall we had a good stay.

The meals and room service was outrageous. $5 for a glass of OJ!!! We went to Ralph's and stocked up on water and snacks and never really ate anywhere down there except starbucks. The safe was not big enough to keep out lap tops in. The noise of the trains did not seem to bother us on the 20th floor.

The Hyatt website is not very helpful with respect to understanding where you want to be in the tower and which rooms are best so I called the reservation line. They requested that I be placed in the Seaport Tower, which is apparently newer than the Harbor tower (southern tower) and also requested a high floor. These requests seemed to work as I was granted both when I checked in. The rooms are about a C+ to B as Hyatt goes, and the bathrooms were nothing special, just your typical standard conference hotel bathroom. The room rate really only paid for the view not for a better room accommodation with respect to service, furnishings or fixtures. Housekeeping was OK as they did not put back the iron or ironing board, no big deal but for a high rate I would have expected better service. Self-Parking is $18 a day, but you can walk to Anthony's fish grotto, Seaport Village and Horton Plaza. The spa facilities are about B, and the massage I had was the same. The spa has a separate outdoor pool and hot tub, which I did not use. The \"Top of the Hyatt bar\" on the top floor of the Harbor Tower has good views and I would recommend it for a sunset drink if you have a clear day. Finally the hotel has two computers in the lobby where you can do online check-in for your airline and print boarding passes (a must these days).

I visted one of the bars in the hotel (several times) and was surprised to find that the prices weren't outrageous. the bartenders were attentive and friendly. The bar is situated in a beautiful, comfortable and very spacious lobby. I also visited Lael's (one of the hotel's restaurants) for the breakfast buffet and for dinner.

I'm not a connoisseur of fancy hotels, but I thought this place was very nice and luxurious. The elevators were fast and convenient; the room was good sized and had a very nice view of the harbor and city. It had a desk with a wired high-speed connection (not free), and the bathroom had a decent sized tub. The air conditioning worked well, and the window cracked open so you could hear the ambience of downtown (basically the trolley crossing every 20 minutes). With the window closed, it was comfortably quiet at night. There were tons of facilities including pool/jacuzzi deck, spa, tennis courts, gym, top floor restaurant, and a LOT more. The look and feel of this hotel seemed to reflect a classic or old fashioned nature- polished stone floor lobby, lots of fine woods, brass, and complimentary tones. I usually don't like staying at higher end hotels because I hate dealing with all the extra steps, tips etc. However, this hotel offered self parking, and overall, everything was really straightforward. On a minor note, the proliferation of the Manchester family photos throughout the hotel was a little awkward. I'm not sure what they were trying to achieve with this, but it could be perceived as self-aggrandizement. We took advantage of the Grand Getaway package, which for $209/night, included free self parking, free breakfast buffet, discounts around town, and (apparently) a room with a nice view. To our pleasant surprise, our room was on the 28th floor of the harbor tower, even though we didn't spend the extra money for the \"really nice view\" upgrades (I forget what they were really called). The only snafu we hit was that we didn't get breakfast vouchers when we checked in, so they were going to charge us $72 for our breakfasts when we were checking out. When I tried to resolve it with one of the ladies at the desk (Rosie), she told us that the reason we were charged was because we ate from the wrong buffet. She even \"double-checked\" with someone (or pretended to) and confirmed that this was probably the case. This didn't make sense to us, because there were no other breakfast buffets in the hotel, so we asked to speak to someone else. The person we then spoke to was much nicer. She explained that we should have received vouchers (when we checked in) that we could use at the buffet. She apologized for this not happening, and said that sometimes it's difficult to keep track of all the details of the packages and offers.

There are beautiful murals, vast check in desk, efficient bellstand personnel. The negative aspects are these: For such a grand hotel, every morning, we had no hot water. This seemed to happen to a lot of people! The business center was very small, and located in one of the towers (there wasn't one for each tower-how inconvenient for guests!), which is not close, if you're in the other tower. The rooms are relatively small, in comparison to what you think you'd be getting from viewing the lobby. The bathrooms are standard boring. Nothing redeeming here-not even the toiletries. The bedding is actually that fabric where you could slide off the bed if you're not careful, because its polyester, or some combination that makes it really slick! The mattresses were even a disappointment. Hallways were narrow, and not very bright. There was definitely no money spent on lobbies on each floor, with, for example two wing- backed chairs, a console table, lamp and flower arrangement would have been nice. Nope, nothing-only the bank of elevators in a smallish area, not enough room for embellishment. The restaurant (and I say one-not more than one in this hotel, believe it or not) was great, however, the service came with great attitude, and I ate there twice (dinner, and breakfast). I must say, however, that room service was very efficient, and everything ordered from them was even more than expected. The bar on the 40th floor had a fantastic view, with mediocre service, and a sad appetizer list...probably because its too far from the kitchen to have anything presentable, so, it has to be something that can be microwaved by the waitstaff. I called the hotel manager the morning I had no hot water, and immediately had three \"engineers\" in my room, however, according to the bell staff, this hot water thing is an ongoing problem, and not the \"mixing valve\" as I was fed by the manager. My husband and I attended functions at the convention center, which sometimes necessitated that we rode the bus provided. The buses would not come up the drive to pick us up (which was troublesome in the rain), and it may have been because they were asked not to. We couldn't figure it out.

Perhaps its the fact that they are quite busy almost every time I passed, but there was a lack of interest showed when I made certain requests (like adding my frequent airline points). I barely was able to say \"thank you\" when I was rudely dismissed when the agent called for the next guest and looked at me as if to get out the way. Another gripe is that the self parking line was always long! It took us about fifteen minutes in line to finally get to a parking attendant. If you happen to stay here on a seemingly busy weekend like I had, allow ample time for the parking garage. The garage not only caters to hotel guests but to the general public as well, which is probably why parking was the way it was.

A good motel, no doubt, very clean and spacious, but with nothing of the luxury touches you expect at the Hyatt. I had just stayed two weeks at the Westin down the road, and this room was quite a contrast. Unattractive bathrooms, very ordinary beds, flannel throws instead of comforters and an irritating shortage of powerpoints (I had to disconnect the table lamp to plug in my laptop). Also, TVs that neither pull out nor swivel, so the only place you can see them is in bed. The chairs at the desk were the regular dinner-table kinds that don't swivel or lean or cna be adjusted for height. All in all, very unfriendly to the business traveller.

I agree with the prior comments that this hotel frequently features large crowds of conference-goers, but it seemed to me that the hotel staff is completely capable of handling these crowds. The staff was consistently very pleasant, attentive, and helpful. I was on the 20th floor of the Harbor Tower and the views were just stunning. I could have just stayed in my room, ordered room service, and enjoyed the views of Navy vessels and sail boats in the bay. The outdoor pool is smallish, but the entire patio area is quite large, and, again, has a great view of the San Diego Bay. The hotel is very nicely located between the Seaport Village (which has good, if not great, restaurants) and the Gaslight District (which has great restaurants). The Embarcadero Marina park (just out the hotel's back doors) is beautiful, with great running/walking paths. The hotel is also quite close (by bus or car) to Balboa Park.

This has to be the hotel's best feature. This hotel is so big, too big to be personal. It was quite an adjustment coming from Hilton La Jolla, just 20 min. up the road, in which we had a very pleasant stay the night before. The room that was given to us was on the 27th floor and admittedly was very good size with plenty of space, however, the decor seemed very outdated and ugly (dark green flower beddings, the kind you would find in your grandma's house). We had a partial (like 10 %) water view and the rest was overlooking the city, but windows were dirty which kind of reduced the impact of the view. By the way, there is no balcony. The bathroom floor had hairs and we had to call to request some bath robes as there were none present in the room. They took forever to bring them and we found stains on them when they finally arrived. The major disappointment was the swimming pool/spa area. Too small for a hotel this size (it was like my friend's apartment swimming pool) and we were packed like sardines in the jaccuzi. If you fancy a peaceful swim, you need to get up early). We had a AAA deal which included free breakfast buffet. When you enter the restaurant the first thing you see is an amazing gourmet brunch buffet. But don't be fooled, we discovered that this was not part of the AAA deal, and we were shown to a smaller lesser value breakfast selection. It was still nice, but it was like dangling candy in front of a child and then taking it away. Parking is expensive, $16 overnight. The checking staff and concierge were very helpful, but restaurant hostess came across very rude. We liked our waitress though.

We arrived early to the hotel and decided to see if we could check-in early. We asked if it was too early to check-in and he said, 'absolutely not.' We were in the Seaport tower with a king, non-smoking room, on the 27th floor. We booked our room through Priceline for a very discounted price. After check-in, we gazed at the amazing new lobby. Beautiful floors, murals, lighting, and furniture decorate the gigantic space. Our room was tastefully decorated and had a wonderful partial view of Seaport Village and then of the harbor. We had a nice armoire with the TV, in room safe, and refrigerator fully stocked with munchies and drinks. Our king sized bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. There was an over sized desk and a chair and ottoman conveniently placed right near the window. The bathroom was very elegant. However, our only complaint, the water pressure was a little weak, nothing too major, however. The hotel work-out facilities are very impressive. Each treadmill had its own flat screen TV. There were also steppers, ellipticals, free weights, and bicycles. There was a charge for using the facilities, $5.00/day, but being a Hyatt Gold Passport member, it's free. The main pool area is very nice and a great size. We had lunch up at the grill one day and were very impressed with the service and value. I also had a massage at the hotel which was unbelievably relaxing! I enjoyed the steam spa and sauna for total relaxation. With any spa services, one can use the spa pool for the day, otherwise, it would be $5.00/day. We had delicious breakfast items at the Redfield Deli and also enjoyed having drinks at the Top of the Hyatt bar one evening. (Prices are a bit spending, but definitely go and check out the view!) Location wise, this was perfect. We were very close to the Gaslamp district, along with Seaport Village, and a quick trolley ride or taxi can take you to Old Town or the zoo in about 10 minutes.
