The room was very large with plenty of seating and storage. The bathroom was very nice and the shower really good. The view of the river was wonderful. The bed was really firm, which we liked. We were glad not to be next to or near the road, which is a busy main road. The only problem we experienced was the sound of someone running water in the middle of the night. It almost sounded as if it was in the same room! The staff are certainly friendly and helpful, especially the waiter at breakfast. Breakfast is a high standard for Italy with a good cold buffet, endless capuccini or espresso, plus hot scrambled eggs and that awful thin shredded stuff that passes for bacon on the continent and in the USA.Partly we chose this place for the swimming pool, which is just what you need after a day's sight-seeing in the Tuscan heat. We had a great swim. Shame the weather turned after the first day. We usually walked in to the town - a pleasant 20 minute stroll along the Arno (tip: take the southern bank - the traffic is much lighter and you get better views). Bus no 14 also passes nearby (single tickets available from Tabacchi, hotel has weekly passes only). We arrived and left by taxi (\u9227?5 approx from SMN railway station).We didn't eat in the hotel but can certainly reccommed the Bellariva restaurant fives minutes walk along the Lungarno into town. We were the only tourists at what is clearly a popular local place. Great food, nice riverside setting, good value. Gelateria Pinguino, also nearby, does incredible icecream.Overall, we were very happy with the hotel but maybe found it a bit of trek during poor weather.", "Date": "Sep 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR443402249", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Grisby341"}, {"Content": "Lovely, just lovely!

It was also a nice touch to have tea and coffee making facilities, which we've never had in Italy before.The walk into town was not as long as we thought it was going to be. From the hotel to the Palazzo Vecchio was twenty minutes, even in sweltering heat. The staff were very welcoming and friendly, especially the afternoon/evening waiter. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble for them and they were very happy to book us tickets for the Uffizi gallery so that we didn't have to wait in the long queues. The pool was of a good size and perfect after a day out sightseeing, though it could do with a few more loungers. Whilst hotel is situated close to a busy road, meaning that there is some traffic noise when you're sunbathing, we really didn't find this to be an issue. Overall, we found this hotel to be great value for money. It's the perfect hotel to act as a good base for sightseeing AND for lazing around by the pool with a good book.

I could see how this might have been nice in the summer, to have a pool and be out of the city (provided you get one of the nice rooms) In October, when it rains and is cold, it isn't a pleasant walk to the city center or the bus, and there is hardly anything nearby to even get some food or drink.

The hotel staff was friendly, and the swimming pool is right outside the restaurant so you could either sunbathe by the pool or sit and have a drink on one of the outdoor tables.

The bus gets quite busy when it gets to the centre so I would advise to avoid peak times if you don't crowds. You do however get a seat as the stop is outside of town. It takes about 5 - 10 minutes by bus (depending on where in town you want to go to). 15 minutes if you are going to the train station. It does also go via a nice route which gives you the opportunity to sightsee a little. The hotel gives you a small pocket sized map to find the bus stop and your way around Florence.
