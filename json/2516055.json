We got upgraded to the penthouse floor (thanks to the husband's SPG rewards membership level) which was pretty nice. Our room was spacious, clean, and modern. I'm usually very picky about my shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, etc, and would always bring mine with me from home as I do not like using the generic hotel products. However, I really loved the products provided by the hotel. The hotel spa downstairs uses these same products that are provided in the rooms. If you are enrolled in their SPG rewards program, they have an eco-green program that allows you to get an additional 500 points for each day that you decline housekeeping to come into your room. You can still request for more toiletries if you need, should you decide to go with this eco-green route. Afterall, we don't need a change of freshly laundered towels everyday, do we? The check-in staff did tell us that under California law, they are required to have housekeeping come in at least once every 3 days. So if you are there for several days, you can choose which day you want or don't want housekeeping. The check-in staff was polite and courteous. Concierge was always friendly and greeted us whenever we stepped out of the hotel (whenever they were around and not disappearing to help other guests, that is). The location of the hotel is pretty good and safe in Westwood . Given its proximity to UCLA, they have a relatively reliable bus system (probably unheard of in LA). It is just a short bus ride away to Beverly Hills (15mins) and Santa Monica (25 mins).... a rarity given that you generally need a car to get around LA.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mke", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "DepartingDuo", "ReviewID": "UR129211561", "Content": "Checkin was super. Associate gave us several recommendations for how to get around and good local places to eat near attractions. She also offered their \"back yard\" pool area as a lunch option. Room was lovely--a suite that felt like home. Backyard restaurant by pool was disappointing. We were seated and never waited on. A waitress finally glanced our way and I motioned for her to come over. We were not her table so she took our drink order and said a gentleman would be over to take the food order. He took his time coming over. We wondered if it was his first day or if he just didn't care. Food took for-ever to arrive. He never checked on us or refilled our drinks. We left a pitiful tip. We did attempt to sit by the pool the next day. Unfortunately it was full and we decided not to hang around at the bar waiting for lounge chairs to open up. We were afraid we would get the same waiter. There are plenty of other places to eat. Hotel is worth staying at I just wouldn't eat near the pool. Besides the poor service it also wasn't a value for our dollar. They are charging way too much money for pizza and sandwiches. We enjoyed the suite and had a great view of UCLA and the city.

But that changed with my recent one-night stay at the W in Westwood. In short, I love the neighbourhood and I love the hotel even more. Unlike other Ws, it is trendy but not overly trendy. The room was spacious and although the gentleman at check-in didn\u2019t mention it outright, I think he upgraded my suite to an even bigger suite. An unfortunate incident with the shower in the room was the only negative but I am sure it was more a mechanical issue rather than a standard of the rooms there. I drove into the hotel at 7pm and was greeted by a friendly gentleman at the valet desk who quickly took care of my car and bags for me. Check-in was equally swift and within minutes, I was on my way to my room. Upon entering, I was surprised that it was bigger than what I remembered booking. It started with a seating area with sofas and an office table, with an adjoining bathroom, then the room continues with another two separate rooms, one the bedroom and the other, another living room with a sofa bed. Since I was travelling solo, it was simply too much. The bed was very comfortable and easily took care of my Zs. The only negative during my entire stay was with the shower. The water pressure was extremely strong, like Niagara Falls-strong, and it was either that or no pressure at all. That shouldn\u2019t be a problem at all for me but the temperature also fluctuated between heaven and hell. One second, it was lukewarm, another it would be scalding hot and next it would be ice cold. Since it was already late by the time I took a shower and I was tired, I fought through and managed to get it done. I complained to the hotel staff upon check-out and they apologized. I really hope they would have fixed it by now because someone could get hurt. On my next trip to LA, I would definitely stay at the W again.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New England", "Title": "\u201cGreat service\u201d", "Author": "averytfunk", "ReviewID": "UR128416459", "Content": "This hotel is very service oriented.

There was plenty of room. The food was really good-more than just hotel food. Breakfast was a standout. Service was generally excellent. The front desk was very responsive when there were problems--which there were. Except for having to remind the server at the pool that a half hour was too long to be forgotten, room service and other dining service was great. The concierge we saw, Karron, was really friendly and helpful. 1. Climate control didn\u2019t work. It was hot when I entered the room. The bellman offered to adjust the temperature. He turned the temperature down. Through the long sweaty night, the air conditioning didn\u2019t come on. By morning I had turned the thermostat down to 60. The thermometer read 72. It was steamy. 2. The windows didn\u2019t open, so no relief was available. 3. I informed the front desk of the in the morning. They sent up a repair person, who left a card saying that the problem was repaired. When I arrived back in the room, it was hot. The thermometer said 72, even though the thermostat was set to 60. Actual temperature was 76. This was true in both rooms of the suite. 4. That evening, I asked the front desk to repair it or move me. Right away, a friendly maintenance person came to the room. He explained, in a way I didn\u2019t understand, why the climate system could not work and yet it was working as designed, and that the temperature setting on the thermostat was irrelevant and had nearly no effect on the system, something about coolant water needing to be reset for many or all rooms at some other location in the hotel other than my room. He opened the windows. 5. With the open windows, I was able to sleep eventually, on the second night. 6. I signed onto and paid for internet access in my room. It worked great for an hour before dinner. After dinner, I needed to upload some work to my office. But I could not sign on. There was no signal. I called the desk. They connected me to tech support. I spent about an hour with a friendly person. After an hour of her repeatedly restarting something at their end\u2014there was and is nothing wrong with my computer, which connected perfectly in the lobby\u2014she was able to get my computer connected for no more than a second or two before the signal disappeared again. 7. Every hotel is currently using the television as a revenue source. Theirs, however, is unusually annoying. Every time the TV is turned on (see photo), I had to page through many (6) different stops of pay services to get directly to regular free TV. Although there was a channel 'guide,' this only said what network was on which channel number. There was no guide to what shows were on. There are no cable systems that don\u2019t provide this, so why not share the secret with your guests? I can only imagine it's to drive guests to pay TV. 8. There is a large, heavy, immobile round piece of furniture in the living room of the suite (see photo). It is not useful as a room-service table because it\u2019s only about 15 inches high. Since it can\u2019t be moved, it interferes with use of the room rather than enhances it. After the first time, I insisted that room service bring up a table with my order. 9. There are zero outlets anywhere near the bed. Forget having your cell phone on the night table, recharging. Bring an extension cord with you. Make it a long one, since there aren't outlets even near the side of the bed. The hotel's lamp and radio occupy all the plugs on the extension cord they use that goes toward the wall in the middle of the headboard. If you want to use that, know that it's not 3-prong, and that you not have either a lamp or an alarm clock. 10. There is minimal clearance at the foot of the bed (see photo). So you, like me and all the other guests, will sleep on one side of the bed. The mattress, at one point in the distant past, have been luxurious. Now, however, the sleeping side is like a rigid hammock into which your body will have to fold whether it fits or not. There is nothing about my experience I want to repeat. There is nothing about my stay that suggests a first-class hotel.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel however We did not feel al home\u201d", "Author": "Guillermo H", "ReviewID": "UR127955128", "Content": "The hotel facilities are good as in any other W however our room was quite noisey And We could hear everything that was happening On the hallway!

We arrived with our 3 year old and found it a little intimidating at 3pm in the afternoon - most of the lounges / cabanas near the pool were taken up by painstakingly coiffed and groomed types with carefully planned tans sipping cocktails who did not seem impressed when we arrived with our excited son avec les pool toys. Staff on the other hand were very welcoming and perhaps on other day, with another crowd, the pool would have been more inviting. The hotel restaurant also doubles as a very trendy bar in the evenings and can come across all power-breakfast and business meeting-like during the mornings. Concierge was very helpful and knowledgeable (and importantly not pushy) so please do take advantage in terms of restaurant choice etc. Overall, a very nice stay but not really somewhere we'd want to hang out for more than 1-2 nights at a stretch unless travelling for work.

I had two wheeled bags that my daughter and I had to lug up the stairs without any assistance (there is no ramp). This shocked me given that there were 2 employees standing around NOT BUSY when we arrived. I'm all for independence but come on...this is the W!!! I am an SPG Platinum member and received an upgrade to a Fabulous Suite which was spacious and quiet as all the other reviews have mentioned. Cons to room: We had shower issues, and the TINY TINY TINY supplied hairdryer overheated and when they brought me a new one it was much larger and they couldn't believe the room still had the tiny \"old\" one. Really? Wouldn't housekeeping notice this before it had to overheat and almost set the place on fire? Our trip to the pool was met with poor service and NO TOWELS! Everyone was asking for towels and we kept being told \"we don't have anything to do with the pool\" by the wait staff. You gotta get some help out there by the pool!! It is pricey to stay here! We did get free internet b/c of the platinum status but everything else cost us a pretty penny! the 9:30 restaurant is very pricey! In the morning they do offer coffee and tea complimentary but anything else (pastry, hard boiled egg, cereal) is $5.00 and up. Pancakes $15.00. A burger $15.00 (for a kid)!!! Just go to Ralph's and get you some snacks and then eat at one of the local restaurants around town. We were charged to have a 4 page document printed ($1.00 a page). The only thing free to print is the boarding passes for airlines. The entire staff should be friendly at all times and I didn't find this to be the case at this W. I felt the staff to be a little snobby and pretentious. You are supposed to get bottled waters when you leave but not once did we get offered one. I saw plenty of people being offered waters but never in our 3 night stay did we get offered a water. Maybe b/c our rental car wasn't nice enough...I don't know.

Westwood is a cute little residential suburb. Although quiet on weekends, on week days the cute cafes and shops are packed with college students and staff. The lobby and bar are classic W. Staff at the welcome desk and concierge were very helpful, and the bell boys brought my bags up straight away. I have stayed at the W in a number of cities world wide but this was the first time I have been upgraded (from a Wonderful room to the Spectacular Suite), which was HUGE considering I was visiting alone! It had a separate lounge and dining area. The bathroom was an odd shape but the shower pressure and towels were good and replaced and cleaned thoroughly each day. Ordered one of the \"make your own burger\"s for in-room dinner one night and was pleasantly surprised it only took about 15-20 minutes. Was very yummy! The pool itself isn't huge but there are lots of sun beds and cabanas so it didn't feel over crowded. Didn't have time to eat at the backyard restaurant unfortunately, but the food I saw people eating looked lovely, and it's a gorgeous spot to sit out on a warm day! This hotel does allow pets. I don't own any pets and was a little worried about noise from dogs in near by rooms, but didn't hear anything at all at night. Not even the music coming from the lobby which was VERY loud on friday night, but I love the young cool W vibe that comes with the chain. The main frustration about this hotel: I HATE that the internet is not free. If I can go to Starbucks and pay $4 for a coffee and get free wifi, surely a hotel where I'm paying $250+++ a night should include it?? $14 per day is insane in this day in age.

There is natural wood in the construction and it's a low-profile building, not a high-rise.

Even though I am happy with the W because of its \"cool\" vibe, here is some deficiencies: 1) We experienced some miserable service at the restaurant - maybe it is because we got served by the bar tender but he was just a pretty bad waiter. But I will discuss that in a separate review. 2) Upon checking in, we went back to the reception area and asked for a bar of soap and slippers. Now, normally, there is a soap to wash your hands in the bathroom. It is such a basic necessity but somehow was forgotten. It is also nice to get slippers to use in the bathroom. When we asked at the reception desk, he just handed them to us. I would have expected that he has them sent to our room. 3) Elevator in the middle - supposed to work if you \"properly\" insert your room card.

Take everything that made you acutely aware of how common you were and lather on a cream too rich to afford. Welcome to the W, Westwood. Subtly perched on a hill just below Sunset and within walking distance to UCLA, the hotel is a deliberate venue. You're unlikely to happen upon it, and it hasn't the \"Hey, look at me!\" glitz that the W in Hollywood airs. People are mellow here. They act \"normal\", unlike the posers who want everyone to think they're \"somebody\", the conspicuously insecure types, prowling around the lobby at the W, Hollywood. Most people here appear on business or on vacation. The men don't hide their wedding bands, and the women aren't all model wannabes. However, the Sunday pool parties and other public events (like the Friday and Saturday night club) are crashed by the broke but beautiful. As a parent, I like that the hotel draws families. Many mums and dads tote toddlers, and the pool is packed with t(w)eenie boppers, splashing about. However, the hotel couldn't be further from family-oriented. Children aren't allowed to \"indulge\" in any of the W's activities or even sit on the sofas in the lounge because they are associated with the bar, Whiskey Blue. In fact, the only place kids can be present outside of their rooms is in The Backyard, the pool area. Who wants to dine while inhaling chlorine every day? The only thing I didn't like about the pool setup is that unoccupied cabanas aren't available to guests without a $150 ransom. Here, you will bake under the SoCal sun or pay the cabana premium because there aren't even any umbrellas by the pool. Activity restrictions aside, the rooms make this W a gem. Hilltop views to the left; Wilshire Corridor views to the right. The \"Fabulous\" suite is basically a two-bedroom apartment without a kitchen. There is a living room, a bedroom, a wet bar, and an office with a pullout sofa. So far, this ranks as my favorite W, if for the suite features alone. ;-) P.S.

I stayed here with my husband and 2 toddlers. The Spectacular Corner Suite we booked \u00a0was lovely, spacious, clean and tastefully \u00a0decorated. The bed was really comfortable. My only gripe is that the bathroom was small and could do with some drawers for toiletries. The bench space was not enough. I thought the showerhead looked a bit cheap but no complaints as the water pressure was good. I did note that the were no coffee/tea making facilities in the room but these are complimnetary at the ninethirty restaurant downstairs. Our corner room was nice and quiet. Staff here, particularly Kathrine (concierge) and Gary (doorman) were ever so obliging. Our 1 year old was really ill so she organised a few numbers for me to call and had the Accura complimentary car, take us to our chosen physician in Santa Monica. Gary organised to have our broken stroller repaired by the hotel's engineerng department. We did have trouble with a request for a microwave oven, needed to heat up our toddlers' meals and milk. When i made the booking, i spoke with reservation and told her it was imperative that we had one and that i would book a room based on whether we could get one. They said we could but when we arrived, i was told there wasnt one available but we would get the first one that became available. One did later that evening but \u00a0quickly discovered that it was faulty. A call to them sent engineering to come and take a look at it and wasnt able to fix it. In the mean time, they sent a kettle which was fine. The next day, I had to call again to say no one had since been up to repair or replace the microwave. We had breakfast the first morning we were there. Offerings were good but a little pricey as with room service. Poolside restaurant was good and they staff were really friendly. Found the kids menu a little too pricey compared to other hotels. We were looking forward to taking out kids to the pool one day but it was closed for a photoshoot. The next day, we found that the pool wasnt heated and the cabanas were being cleaned so that was a disappointment. Had a blissful treatment at the Bliss Spa on level 2. This is a must do for any stay at the W. Be su to partake in the complimentary brownies in the lounge. Location is not bad. Near Ralphs, Trader Joes and Wholefoods if you need groceries. Short drive to Century City and Beverly Hills shopping. Note that valet is $35 a night. We booked online and there was package that included parking and 2 sip tickets for cocktails. It would have been the same price for the room only.

The issues, however, seem to be going on chain-wide as several of my last stays at Ws had been quite disappointing. You know something is wrong if at every single property of the chain you are staying at, you'll witness unhappy customers at reception arguing about issues they've encountered. Was the same here and I'm not surprised: The staff seem helplessly overworked, far too few people man the reception and there is hardly ever anyone at the concierge desk. Hence you can literally feel how unhappy and disengaged everyone is which shows in the service provided. Just a few examples were the Accura service which offers the last drive out at 5:15 (who needs it so well before dinner?) and then has an unshaven, hardly speaking driver- I remember that being much better from a few years back. Other usual issue was late check out but then getting the key cut only till noon. As a result I was standing in my bathrobe coming from the pool with water dripping from me at reception, no one caring and making me wait for ages. Then having the guts to ask me for ID! Good joke. Ah and the \"Whatever whenever\" as in almost all W hotels these days totally overpromised: Tried once, no one picked up. Tried twice, person on other end totally stressed and trying to get rid of you as fast as possible. Property itself also a total disappointment: Besides the horrid location (in the middle of no where next to a uni campus, 25 bucks plus for a cab ride each way to get to Hollywood or West Hollywood), the building is an old and ugly concrete block that clearly shows its age. Pool in reality is muuuch smaller than shown on their website and worst of it all, the walls throughout the building are paper thin and most guests seem to be teens and twens who share (officially or inofficially) share their rooms with three four others in order to afford them and then make use of that by partying all night- very classy. Bathrooms have simple stuck to the wall shower heads and come with a yuck old shower curtain (!), like in one of those mouldy hotels from the 80ies. All in all an utter disappointment, cancelled my upcoming trip in March straight away and instead booked with the competition. If you're staying in the area, I would recommend the Andaz in West Hollywood or the Rennaissance up on Hollywood Boulevard- both offer better service than the W, are usually cheaper even and definitely are located better.

Not sure what this building was before it became a hotel, but they really missed the boat. Simply put, the quality of construction and amenities is crap. Natural lighting on most of the rooms that face the interior of this \"H\" shaped building is terrible, and compounded by plantation shutters that don't match the chic-esq decor that the hotel tries to project. In the morning, the plumbing is so loud it woke us up. Adding to the negative vibe here is that there stress having everything you want, many things that most hotels offer, like an in-room coffee machine do not exist. I don't want to have to get dressed to get my first cup of joe in the morning, nor do I want to pay $8 for it either.

In this case they deliver on a few things but miss the mark on most. Most of the problems relate to design and upkeep, starting with the fact that the hallways and room smelled old and musty throughout our stay. I brought this to the attention of whatever/whenever who could only have housekeeping 'spray', which didn't solve the problem. The problem could likely be solved by being able to open the small windows in the room, but maintenance claimed that they could only be opened by four inches, hence there is little if any fresh air in the rooms. Speaking of windows, the exterior windows were absolutely filthy, looked liked they haven't been washed in years. The windows are small to begin with, allow little light in the rooms, and they have these overly large shutters on the inside of the windows. Combine inability to open windows with dirty, small windows and you have a room that smells stale. Old windows are also not double glazed and the room was noisy - we heard traffic , pool noise, gardeners working all day and night despite being mid-lvel in a largely residential neighborhood. Bathroom was disproportionally small compared to the room itself, had only a single sink with very little counter space and nowhere to store toiletries. Tub/shower was standard (small) and with non-hygenic creepy shower curtain that stuck to you while shower was on. Wood veneer was fraying off bathroom door, grout was moldy and there was no exhaust fan in bathroom. Other than that, the West Elm inspired hipster room with funky decor was ok. Pool area was pleasant enough, but furniture was shabby, lounges torn and stained and the pool itself wasn't the infinity variety one would expect in a hip boutique hotel in LA. It seemed like the old pool from whatever the property was before W took over. Only positive I can think of was a friendly staff, who were always eager to help. I personally think W needs a strong dose of quality control and this property could use some management attention.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMediocre Hotel with trendy aspirations that fails to deliver.\u201d", "Author": "FrancisDavid", "ReviewID": "UR118585516", "Content": "Stayed for four nights. I travel extensively (globally) and have normally loved W hotels. Not this one. Place looks great, but they clearly don't keep it in good condition.

Here are a few highlights: air con controls did not work, so only way to control room temp was to turn off completely then wake up and turn on, then off, etc. First morning order breakfast, and they send wrong order (not a big deal, happens) but the coffee mug they give me had dirt, old oatmeal and lip stick stains. I send back. They bring me a new pot (but no cup). Hmmm. Come back to room second evening after all day meetings, and room had not been cleaned. I was told short staffed--really, on the busiest weekend in LA with the Emmys? Phone near bed didn't work, and I advised them first day. Was never fixed entire four days. Noticed that lobby area near bar and the hallways were not cleaned often. Normally, could care less, but it was very unpleasant to see the same used martini and wine glasses in the lobby and the food trays sitting outside people's doors for days on end. And the hotel could use a better vacuum. Now with all of these minor nits, I did politely raise concerns with front desk etc. Each was met with a lovely smile, a knowing head-shake, and some charming lne about \"whatever we Whenever, what is your wish\" or something. Sadly, nothing was done. At check out, I again expressed my concerns and I think they really do care---but I would suspect nothing was done. They still had old wine glasses piled up near the bar from the night before. I will not be staying there again, and will return to my normal LA hotels of the Four Seasons and the Beverly Hilton.

During my stay on the fourth of July weekend and days prior to seeing my monthly credit card statement, I was very happy with the W Los Angeles Westwood hotel. After that I'm still pissed. The Room - I stayed at the Spectacular Suite. The room looked somewhat similar to the pictures on the hotel website - spacious and nice, however, some signs of dated (particular the couch and its pillow cases) and I was a bit freak out by the countless mold-like spots on the circular mirror above the bed (still unable to figure out whether it was the original design or the real mold). Thin wall though, can easily hear the conversation from the hallway and the big bangs when other guests shutting their doors. No problem with plumbing as mentioned by other reviewers. The Staff and Service - Nice and very friendly staff. Anyway I still wonder why they kept telling me their names. I asked for a quiet room and they did assign me the nice one on the north wing. I didn't have a chance to try Acura Experience which is a drop-off service within 5 miles of the hotel (they don't do pick-up just simply drop-off). The service available M-F 7am-3pm, SAT-SUN 10am-6pm. The free Wi-Fi - I managed to access the hotel free Wi-Fi in my room (on the 14th floor) both on laptop and iPhone for the entire stay. I first logged on to the free Wi-Fi at the lobby from my phone - select the Living_Room Wi-Fi The Pool - The pool is relatively small and suitable for kids, don't trust what you see from the website. Private cabana looks great but they charge you for it. The Neighborhood - Westwood is such a nice neighborhood, the hotel located on the skirt of UCLA campus (one reviewer said the W used to be the UCLA dorm, I didn't have a chance to verify it). Many nice restaurants, cinemas and shops, you name it from Trader Joe's, RiteAid, CVS, Ralphs, Best Buy, AT&T, T-Mobile, Radio Shack, Urban Outfitters to Victoria's Secret. I'd recommend Le Pain Quotidien and Elysee for breakfast. Napavalley Grille has a beautiful outdoor seating area but mediocre food, not sure why it was packed. The sushi place right next to Le Pain Quotidien is so so. From the Airport - I took Prime Shuttle which costs $15. I guess Super Shuttle offers the same price. The GIMMICK and UGLY ENDING - You gotta watch your bills and your credit card statement. The hotel charged my credit card for minibar without my knowledge after I left. During the check out, they told me everything is all set, no extra charge since I prepaid for my room on the hotel website. Fortunately, after checked out, I was waiting for my friend to pick me up for about an hour at the lobby which they could have told me if something was missing but they didn't. When I saw the charge on my credit card statement, I rang them up and they told me it was a charge from the minibar and said can't do anything, I've to contact billing dept directly during the office hours (M-F/9-5). I wrote them and they gave me a refund about a week after. But still, I'm pissed. So without bad ending that they charged me for something that I didn't consume or service that I didn't use, I'd have rated my stay highly. Unfortunately, the rip-off scheme dragged down the whole customer satisfaction level. And I won't stay at this property again because of this incident. It's a big disappointment for the hotel in this class. I saw similar mention from other customers too so think twice before you book or hand them your credit cards. Good luck!

We checked in really late on our first night there (like at 1AM). The lobby was a bit overwhelming at that hour. Music was blaring and the whole place felt like a dance club not a hotel lobby. It was a bit too much after traveling on a plane all day. I just wanted to get to my room, not deal with the party scene, scantily clad people, and all that noise. We were rewarded when we finally did get to our room. There was a bottle of champagne and a chocolate dessert set out for my birthday! It was a nice surprise treat for 1AM. The rooms themselves are quiet and spacious. There is a lot of hallway noise and banging around in the morning though from the cleaning staff. They were especially loud when they were right above our room. Our room was a junior suite and it had a separate living room with a couch and tv. I'm not sure if every room is like that but it was nice. I liked the toiletries in the bathroom. They were Bliss spa products and smelled lemony. This hotel does have some crazy charges though - wifi, valet parking, room service, etc. We asked for beach towels one day and they put a $50 charge on your card until you return them. We returned them and I asked to make sure they would remove the charge and the guy said he would right away. Well guess what, the charge was still there upon check-out! I asked them to remove it again and they finally did. Just make sure you double check your bill at check-out. We had a 50% off coupon for room service and our breakfast bill for 1 croissant, 2 muffins, and 2 glasses of tap water was still $14. The elevators are super annoying here. You have to insert your card in just the right way to get to your floor. If another group already entered the elevator and did their card then you are screwed. The elevator is already zooming past your floor before you get to insert your card and press your floor button. You will end up going way up to a high floor and then you'll have to ride the elevator back down again to your floor. I heard numerous people complaining about this. The hotel should just get rid of the need to swipe the cards first. I would stay at this hotel again if the price was right. The rooms are pretty luxurious and the hotel is in a nice location.

The hotel is not right in the center of activity, but I liked that! It was pretty quiet, very relaxing, and just a short drive away from Hollywood, Robertson, etc. When we arrived, there was a fruit and cheese tray and Fiji bottled water waiting for us, along with a hand written note telling us to enjoy our stay... A nice little extra touch! We stayed in a decent-sized suite with plenty of seating space to relax, drink wine, and watch TV. The room was very clean, and we we received excellent customer service throughout our stay. The few drawbacks about the room were that shower didn't drain very well or have ventilation in the form of a fan, etc. (wouldn't bother normal people, but I am a bit chlostrophobic!), the hair dryer was AWFUL, and the room never seemed to get cold enough. But as I said before, the customer service is beyond reproach... I'm sure if we had mentioned any of this to the staff, they would have made every effort to remedy these situations, but we never took the time to ask. There is also no overhead lighting, but that only bothered me when I was trying to get ready/put on my makeup, etc. The Bliss products that they leave in the bathroom each day are actually ones that you will want to use instead of the products that you brought with you! The parking is $35 a night, and it is worth it the 1st night when you are onloading all your bags and getting familiar with the area. If you don't feel like paying that much for parking every day (we didn't!), there is very inexpensive parking just around the corner, across the street from UCLA & down the street from Best Buy.

I was a little worried based off of some of the reviews, but I always read through and am willing to sometimes take a chance to see if my experience is the same as others....and I must say I 100% disagree with all of the negative reviews! We had a PHENOMENAL time!!! I was so bad at getting people's names this trip (I usually get them and remember...but basically from June 30 at 8pm until July 3 at 9am anyone who was working the desk, lobby, breakfast area or valet/front door is included in this comment), but all of these people were absolutely cheerful, helpful and very nice!! They even asked us if we got to our room and decided we wanted another one, to let her know and she would be happy to change it for us. The day we checked out, the nice young man at the front desk was very helpful in correcting our bill and asked to make sure there wasn't anything else he could do for us. I think we didn't encounter a single person who wasn't attentive and super helpful! We had so much fun with the camera booth in the elevator always dancing and making funny faces...you just have to remember that you might be striking some funny dance pose right as the doors open!!! We laughed every time! The room was GREAT!! We had a great living room with a huge L-shaped couch, you usual cool W decor and then a great sleeping area that had everything that we needed. Even loved the Ipod/Iphone hookup so we could jam to our own tunes while getting ready to go out! Yes, as in previous reviews, the bathrooms may be small...but really...you are in LA...how much time are you going to spend in the bathroom??!?! It really goes with the modern decor and even with 2 girls in one room, we didn't have a problem sharing the bathroom. We also enjoyed the hotel bar one night after a dinner on the town. The decor in the W bars are just exceptional and fun! I love love the live DJ!!! I'd agree though, it's not a place to be bringing your little kids down, but for the rest of us, it was such a nice relaxing, fun environment. We did park at the hotel the first nigh which was $35/night...but to be honest, I travel a lot for work and in every major CITY (not the burbs) that is not unheard of and is fairly common rate...I paid the same in Atlanta. BUT one tip I might add for those staying is that we found parking literally right around the corner every single other day/night!! Yes, they have parking meters, but we put in a couple of dollars and it was good for a few hours...more than enough time for us to get ready or between our outings and then after 8pm it was free until 8am (M-S) or 11am(Sun). There was an open parking spot every time, so I'd highly recommend if you aren't just hanging out at the hotel all day. But when we did use the valet, they were superb!!! They offered us bottled water for our trip out for the day and if we needed anything else. The location is great also! It's not right in the middle of BH, but literally right down the road from the Bev Hilton and all the Rodeo Drive/Robertston Blvd fun!! I loved the location (PS: Try Paris Bakery around the corner). Hmmm, trying to think of the cons....still thinking....oh, right, we thought the hairdryer was too small...you know how girls need a big hairdryer! And if THAT is the only thing I can come up with, then I'd say this is a definite A+ for the W LA!!! It was my cousin's first trip to LA and she said she loved the hotel and the great service they gave us! We'd definitely come back and recommend to anyone!!!

I should have read the reviews prior to our visit. The W Hotel in Westwood tries too hard to be hip. In doing so, they really miss the mark. The exterior of the hotel is aged and unattractive, but the club atmosphere starts with the blue lighted stairs and continues to the lounge like lobby with loud music. If traveling with children, avoid the pool which is small, crowded and filled with drunk young adults making out on chaise lounge chairs. Even the cabana interiors have silhouettes of people dancing with hands in the air. We drove to LA and called the hotel 5 minutes out to see if our rooms were ready, the front desk stated that they could not tell me until I was at the hotel. I told them the cross streets and explained that we would be there in a few minutes if the room was ready, but would rather come later if it was not ready. They again stated that I had to be there in person at the front desk before they could provide any information. Upon arrival, I was told that our rooms were not ready. I mentioned that they needed to be connecting (as we told the reservation specialist and was noted in our confirmation). He told me that the hotel had no connecting rooms and that ours were on separate floors. 45 minutes later, he found 2 rooms on a low floor that were next to each other. He gave me the key to one. It was a queen (we reserved and paid for a king) and was cramped with a garden view (which actually meant we looked out onto the roof). I told the front desk that the selection was not acceptable and told him we would sight see and return later that evening. At 7PM, we returned and were given keys to our new rooms. They were on the same floor and down the hall from each other. Not really what we wanted since the 2nd room was for our children. Every time we needed to interact, we had to dress and head down the hall. We ended up with a queen (downgraded from what we paid for). They layout of the rooms is odd at best. Small bathrooms with shower/ tub combo, plastic trash cans, 1 robe, no slippers, and limited bath amenities - basically what you'd expect at a Holiday Inn. The bathroom did not connect to the bed room. The water heater made the temp too hot or warm with alternating cold. The desk chairs are hard plastic and too low to be useful. Poor lighting. The beds are firm - almost futon like. There is only 1 extra pillow to provide a total of three and no extra blanket. The windows do not provide adequate sound proofing from the party at the pool and the shutters without blackout curtains ensure that you will be up with the sun. There is no newspaper delivery nor turndown service. We called for slippers and waited 45 min the 1st night before canceling the order and re-ordering the following day. The carpet in the hallway was never vacuumed during our 3 day stay and there was hair in our bathroom and in bedroom drawers. Parking was $35 per day. Wi-fi is $14.99 per 24 hours (noon to noon). We were there for a birthday (as noted on the reservation), but no acknowledgement was made by management. Upon receipt of our bill, we noted that we were charged parking for 2 vehicles and also a mini bar item that we did not consume. The best things about the hotel are the: Valet attendants - polite and prompt Location- adjacent to UCLA campus Fun restaurants and snacks - Ditty Reese, Barney's Beanery, Stans Donuts You can experience the fun of Westwood at other hotels.

The following incidents occurred: 1. Upon arrival late Thursday night, my sister and I were given a suite with a Queen at a rate of $389. I recalled that we had a King, and the next morning on my way out the door, I asked about it. The woman at the front desk would not give me the King without my confirmation or unless I would pay an extra $30 or $40 a night. I didn\u2019t have my reservation confirmation with me, but I found it later that day, and our reservation confirmation stated we had a suite with a King for $369. This was remedied Friday afternoon upon another visit to the front desk. We were ultimately charged $389 for the room, but on Sunday when I checked out, I was able to get the price adjusted to the quoted rate. 2. When I woke up in our suite with a Queen on Friday morning. I went to the bathroom to shower and inside the tub there was a brown/black splatter liquid everywhere. It looked like mud or sewage or someone had been violently ill all over the tub. I immediately called the concierge to have it fixed. I waited a half hour and no one came. I had an appointment I had to make, so I called back. Someone finally came within the hour. He cleaned up the mess but said that he\u2019d need to come back to clear out the drain. I had to shower and get ready to leave, so I showered in water that literally came up to my knees. Disgusting. 3. We switched rooms Friday afternoon. Again, the shower in our second room filled up to mid calf every time we showered. This is absolutely filthy. 4. Our second room, like the first, mysteriously only had one robe. I requested one on Friday afternoon. None arrived. I requested one late Friday evening. None arrived. I called for a third time Saturday afternoon for a robe, and finally one arrived. 5. Upon arrival in the second room, I went to grab a glass. The glass was covered in \u201cprotective/sanitary\u201d plastic, but it also was covered in a yellow fugusy film around the rim. I called for new glasses. None arrived. I called for new glasses with the robe late Friday evening, and they finally arrived. In addition, it was quite shocking that housekeeping did not remove this filthy glass from the room when they cleaned it on Saturday. While all of these things were unacceptable for a hotel with such a high rate, what was so baffling to me was the fact that no one asked me how my stay was (even on check out when I was getting our bill adjusted!!!), tried to remedy any of these situations, or seem to really care about our stay.

Take a couple steps and there was a 42\" plasma tv on a swivel above a wrap around couch. The bed was made up with extra thick blankets and padding. And made me sleepy looking at it. The bathroom was nice and clean. After we checked in to our Spectacular Suite, I had to go to the music studio to do some recording. My wife found herself by the pool a few minutes later and had fun relaxing poolside. She also enjoyed the spa. The location was great. I was able to get to Rodeo Dr, Hollywood, Venice Beach and other sight seeing locations easily. We danced the night away at the club. I wish our stay was a little longer. Overall my wife left talking great things about LA. So you guys help me win her over The pros- room was very nice. The mini-bar was fully stocked. The bed was extra comfy. The room service was great. The cons- we didn't have a tub, just a shower. The windows didn't have black out drapes so I ended up getting up earlier then I would have like to. And there was only one person at the front desk when I needed to ask a mid stay question. Ohh and parking is $35 per 24 hr period. Thank you Alyssa for all your help.

We really appreciate the convenience and high standards of this hotel property. The staff throughout the hotel really seems to enjoy what it\u2019s doing. They truly understand the hospitality business. The property is spotless, and the rooms are very clean and modern. We regularly dine at the hotel and major changes have recently occurred. Although we had always been happy with the food at Nine Thirty (which is the street address of the hotel) and the Backyard, we were anticipating the arrival of the new chef, Dakota Weiss, at the beginning of the year. We had heard from Ren Hirose, the GM, and restaurant managers Chris Cazares and Stephanie Sanders that she had survived an amazing round of tastings, up against some 20-plus other chefs. No doubt the competition was fierce \u2013 sounds like it could have been a ubiquitous reality show. We gave her about three weeks to settle in before heading over for our first visit, and the verdict is in. Naturally, in such a short time she hadn\u2019t completely redone the menus, but her touches were already apparent. For example, the previous chef had an appetizer (or \u201cside,\u201d as it\u2019s referred to there) of Brussels sprouts. Many people don\u2019t particularly care for Brussels sprouts, but these were good. Very good. They\u2019re something we never would have previously thought to order off a menu. Dakota Weiss changed the seasonings and made the preparation healthier (grilled rather than fried), and we didn\u2019t miss the old version at all. Being independently creative, Dakota moved on from Brussels sprouts to create an appetizer of baby artichokes in smoked garlic aioli and chopped basil that is also healthy, flavorful and out of this world. Her new creations are full of twists. A very grown up macaroni and cheese uses very small, round pasta (their true name escapes us), with bacon, apple bits and garlic bread crumbs. This is definitely not the fake orange powdered boxed stuff we all made growing up, nor even an adult version of a traditional mac and cheese. Other sides were delightfully different \u2013 charred broccoli with lemon, red chili oil and parmesan. Honestly, if all food were prepared and served this way, multitudes of children wouldn\u2019t have grown up afraid to try anything green, healthy and supposedly boring. We\u2019re working our way through the menu \u2013 we often order several sides (and \u201csmalls\u201d which are truly a few bites to share), some of which show up time and time again \u2013 and entrees (a \u201clarge\u201d). There\u2019s something for every palate \u2013 seafood, fish, chicken, steak. A favorite is the beef bourguignon \u2013 anyone who has watched \u201cJulie and Julia\u201d might try it for that reason alone, but it is quite satisfying. And the desserts are lots of fun and creative \u2013 who would think of a chocolate creation, including chocolate puffed rice \u2013 in a tall parfait glass? Everything is beautifully plated. But the most fun is Dakota herself. We asked to meet her after our first meal and have spoken with her several times since, and all we can say is, what fun. She definitely looks the part of a creative person. If you saw her on the street, you might think she was an actress. Always bubbly and charming, her tone indicates her love for what she\u2019s doing, which is good given the long hours and weighty expectations. Although many very creative people are thought of as not being terribly business-minded or organized (yes, it\u2019s a stereotype, but there is a reason they exist!), her comments indicate her seriousness about how she runs her kitchen. There, she\u2019s definitely the captain of the ship and she expects it to be run with precision and excellence -- but for the staff to enjoy it as well. We\u2019re looking forward to more dining adventures as Dakota sets new culinary trends.", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monrovia, Liberia", "Title": "\u201cLike coming home\u201d", "Author": "avizaid", "ReviewID": "UR106337357", "Content": "Right in the center of all action.The mega suite is very specious,interesting food at the Resturant next to the pool.", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cAllergy to cigarette smoke\u201d", "Author": "nyctravel8", "ReviewID": "UR106157465", "Content": "I have been looking forward to my stay at the W hotel since Feb. when I booked my \"fabulous suite\".

It was the weekend of the Oscars so the hotel was sold out and when I arrived at approximately 11pm, they told me that had upgraded me once, but had to upgrade me again since they were completely sold out. Worked for me, I got to stay in an amazing Mega suite. A bit unnecessary for my 8 hours in the hotel (only spent sleeping), but the 8-room suite was incredible. Very nicely done and very spacious, there was a huge entryway with wet bar area, which lead to a bathroom on the right and one bedroom, a table area straight ahead and a large couch area with TV, etc. Off of that, there was a room with a couch and a desk, another bedroom and another bathroom with a huge soaking tub. I really can't say I experienced much of the hotel since I was there only to sleep, but the little service I had was pretty good. The hotel is missing some of the touches I've experienced at other Ws (personal notes or message on the phone welcoming me) and even when I was being checked in, the man seemed a bit like he was doing me a favor giving me the upgrade. Trust me, I appreciate it, but it's also their choice -- it's a much better experience when they say with excitement, we have a great room for you! without making you feel like you owe them something more. I think the location is great, you can walk to Westwood shops and restaurants so in the morning it was easy to pick something up at the Coffee Bean. I was even able to find street parking overnight. The hotel was chaotic on a Thu night, very trendy, but I didn't have any issue with the noise once I was in my room. I agree with the one comment about the lighting though -- there are lights everywhere but not a lot of light switches so you're attempting to find the switch on each light in the dark which is a bit of a pain.

What a great trip! We were celebrating two birthdays (one late Dec / the other early Jan) with a long 3-night weekend and after reading reviews and looking at many of the Starwood properties I know I picked the right place. First, I was booked into the new W Hollywood and after reading horrible reviews of noise and partying all night I decided that was not the scene we were looking for. Then, booked the Sheraton Delfina Santa Monica (we've been there before, nice but nothing overly special) and because I wanted to be closer to Beverly Hills area made a reservation for the SLS. Then decided that would be overkill (and dark) so finally ended up at the W Westwood. The right choice. What was best about it? The Service. I had let the hotel know that we were celebrating a birthday (via e-mail) and as a SPG Gold member anything they could do upgrade wise would be appreciated. Upon check-in I was offered a corner Spectacular Suite on a high floor (which was great since there were just the two of us, about 600sf). As I used Starpoints, I could have paid to upgrade to one of the bigger suites ($60-$200 a night) but this one meet our needs just fine. The bed was the highlight--really comfy. Check-in was a breeze, the suite was ready (benefit of checking in on a Thursday). Was even asked if I needed a 4 pm checkout on Sunday (nice touch!). Was taken up to the room and not long after we arrived a up came a bottle of champagne and a little chocolate cake with a card from Ren the GM. How cool is that? That is one of the reasons I stay loyal to Starwood-- most of them know how to take care of their frequent guests. As I majored in hospitality and worked in several hotels, I know how difficult it is to try and please everyone and we loyal guests can be demanding. :) Whenever I called for wine glasses, extra towels or to get the room serviced quickly someone was there in 5 minutes. Amazing. Folks on the phone were friendly and professional and were able to answer my questions. A note about the area--it seemed like a strange for a W Hotel to be. I usually think of them as beach front or in the heart of the city. I'm assuming this hotel was something else and was converted into a W. They did a good job. Few things to note: The AT&T iPhone Service was great from the suite. Full 3G - good signal strength. Was a nice surprise. I wish the bathroom in our suite was bigger and more modern. It was really small and the toilet faced the sink. Very strange set-up. When checking in I found out that many of the suites don't have bath tubs (just showers) and we wanted a tub so maybe that's the reason. Don't know how big the shower only ones are. Bring a portable speaker system for your iPod/iPhone if you want to listen to music in your suite. I was surprised that it was missing since it seems like that is common in the W's I've stayed in. With the strange residential like location, you aren't going to get amazing views from your suite like you would if you were closer to the beach or the hills. And, because the hotel was most likely a refurb the windows are small and have shutters. All furniture is modern, TV's are new and the bed comfy. There is only one robe in the suite which is strange. You have to call for another one. Maybe they get more solo business travelers there? The facility itself is the perfect size. Great lobby lounging (a W trademark) and bar area out by the pool with complimentary coffee in the cafe each morning. FYI, housekeeping will also bring up a coffee maker to your room upon request but the coffee downstairs is much better and worth trekking down for. One disappointment is the pool itself. Really small pool (it's much smaller than the picture makes it out to be) and it is very cold... i couldn't go in but a few kids braved it and went in. Cabanas are nice -- the entire pool deck could use a face lift and a large group hot tub would be a great addition to the place. There is room for one. The 24 hour complimentary gym is great-- cold towels for your face after working out along with green apples. Way cool. Watch your face in the elevator... funny and creative. You'll realize what I'm taking about once you are inside the elevator. :) Sunday brunch is a great deal for the areq. For 20.11 you get two courses. Show your SPG card and get 15% off your bill. We sat out by the water fall/pool and had a nice brunch. Food was tasty. Many folks have remarked about pricing. For those of you that don't want to spend $38 a night for Valet and don't mind walking a block, there is a garage that does overnight parking with in and out privileges for $14 a night (cash only, tax included). In addition, you can avoid the overpriced mini-bar by walking a few blocks to Trader Joes. There is also a Riteaid, CVS, Ralph's market, Wholefoods and even a Best Buy right near the hotel. We had a few drinks at the lounge bar but went to TJ's and brought back snacks, water and some wine to share with friends who were visiting us in our room. The hotel is laid back and didn't seem to have a problem with it. They also will bring up whatever extra glasses you need (just tip please!) We had a great lunch a Angelinos (6 min walk from the hotel, Yelp it). Family run and excellent food. $10 bucks gets you their daily pasta special (generous portion) and a salad. It was really good and I high recommend it. We walked around the area and it primarily caters to college students. Looks like some of the more expensive restaurants have gone under and there are lots of for lease signs out where retail shops used to be. You'll find plenty of burger and pizza joints, Starbucks, Peets, Subway, etc. I guess it is a sigh of the times. Need an ATM, they are close... you can easily walk to most places. If you have a car, be sure to check out Nook Bistro. It's about a 15 min drive from the hotel but the food is amazing. Small place and reservations are highly recommended. If you have an iPhone, download the Nook app and you can win a free drink or desert. Very creative idea. Popular place -- we couldn't get a reservation but went anyway and had to beg to get in... it worked, barely. :) Heading over to West Hollywood? Traffic is a nightmare, especially on Wilshire. Make sure allow ample time to get around during rush hour. Ok, I think I've rambled on enough. This place is worth it. Thank you Ren and your amazing staff for a wonderful time and excellent service.

First, the location was great. My room looked out onto the UCLA campus -- but was still quiet -- and the area definitely had a neighborhood-ly feel. A short walk down the tree-lined mostly residential street brings you to several major thoroughfares, with shops and restaurants aplenty. Head up Weyburn Ave. three blocks to the intersection of Westwood Blvd and you'll be in an area that feels like a little college town. I-405 is only a few minutes away by car, and the trip to Santa Monica took about 15 or 20 minutes (much longer at rush hour). Staff at the hotel were all friendly, especially the desk and the parking valets - though watch out, the mandatory valet parking will set you back a pretty penny per night. (Whether you have a car or not, don't forget to take advantage of the free Acura shuttle service that will take you to local spots.) Service was as expected from a W, though I found the staff at this hotel (and the hotel in general) far less pretentious than say, the Atlanta W Midtown. The pancake breakfast downstairs was quite good, but definitely not worth the more than $25 with tax and tip. The room was clean and modern, and fairly spacious. My only complaint about the room was the lack of outlets anywhere close to the bed. So if you want to charge your phone overnight and leave it next to the bed you're out of luck (though the hotel did provide an industrial-strength extension cord when I asked). There's also a kiosk in the lobby for free printing of airline boarding passes. Finally, the big disappointment was the fitness center. While it is fairly well-equipped, with treadmills, bikes, ellipticals, balance balls, free weights and machines, it felt extremely cramped. It was also so dark the I couldn't even read the numbers printed on the machines' weight stacks (or the instructions). That was an annoyance, but could also be a safety issue and should be corrected.

Not everyone's cup of tea i gather but right up my alley. Dislike - basic 1-bedroom suite too small (in bedroom you couldn't get to the window without walking over the merely full-sized bed).

Westwood is the home of UCLA and Westwood Village which is a great place. The Hotel is walking distance to the campus, several great restaurants, Diddy Reese cookies, Stan's Doughnuts and BJs. The hotel is located about a mile from the I-405. It is about 3 miles from Beverly Hills. While it is a little further out of the way, it is a lovely place to stay without all the hustle and bustle of LA/ Beverly Hills. The service at the hotel is very good and lives up to the W standard. Lance welcomes you as soon as you stop. The hotel has valet parking ( $35 a day which irritates me). The hotel also has the Acura experience. An acura MDX drives you around the immediate vicinity for free. It is very nice. I had a specatcular suite which was very roomy. All of the rooms in this hotel are supposed to be suites. The room had a spacious living room with a large plasma tv. The beds are very comfortable and there was another LCD tv in the bedroom. The bathroom was modern with a good shower and good water pressure. There was no bathtub however. Internet is not free ( $14.95 per day, another irritation). The rooms were cleaned well however, I happen to like the Bliss products so I keep them for travel use. After the 2nd day the maid stopped replacing them. I was not happy with this. Ive never been to a hotel where this happen. And in doing this she didnt replace the shampoo an conditioner which were empty and needed replacing. SWEAT ( the hotel gym) is adequare with TechnoGym equipment. There are treadmills, ellipticals and bikes all with tvs. There are also dumbells up to 50 lbs and an ab machine. There is water, apples and cold towels. However, they did not provide earphones for the gym. The pool is nice and a nice place to relax. I ate at the restaurant 930 which was a very pleasant meal.

Although previous posters have mentioned poor service, the service we experienced, from the front desk to the concierge to the pool staff were all friendly and helpful. The building is definitely older, but the decor is modern. The lobby has the cool, clean style of the other W's. I'm just sorry I didn't grab one of the cupcakes when we checked-in. They were gone by the time we came back down to the lobby. We had a corner room so it may have been slightly larger than the others. It was nice to have a separate sitting room with a TV and desk. The view from the bedroom wasn't that great - right above the generator looking into another buidling, but we didn't spend much time in there anyway. The bathroom was really spacious and had a great shower. The only thing I didn't like was the small sink. It's too easy to splash water around the vanity. The Bliss products were great! One of the reasons we selected the W was because of the pool. It was actually much smaller than I had envisioned (and would have guessed looking at the pictures), so it was quite crowded when we went to check it out the first day. It was later in the day, so we didn't actually go to the pool. But we went down to the pool early on Saturday morning to stake our claim to two pool chairs. I guess many people come to the pool who aren't hotel guests, so they actually had \"security\" at the pool entrance. Service at the pool was a little slow at times, but they came around to check on us fairly regularly. One nice thing about the pool area is they have magazines and sunscreen for guests to use. No need to run out to the drug store if you forgot your sunscreen! The food was a little expensive for what it was, but it was well prepared - although it's a bit hard to eat on the pool chairs without a table. Even though we only stayed for two nights, the hotel staff seemed to recognize us and welcome us back whenever we walked in or rode the elevator. Because the buiiding is older (it seems like it's a converted apartment or condo complex), the walls are thin and it can get noisy. I'm glad we requested a room away from the elevators. I also thought it was interesting that we had to sign a document that said we wouldn't have more than 4 people in the room. I guess they've had plenty of party and noise complaints....

While it was a bit out of the way, I read the reviews here in Trip Advisor and was curious about the mix of comments. My experience started VERY badly as I was greeted aggressively by a valet/security guy at curbside who snapped that i was parking in a hotel zone. I replied \"great, because I'm checking in\" he then asked if I was \"sure\" that I was a guest <!> I stifled the snappy comebacks that sprang to mind (e.g., \"Seeing as you've created this *great* first impression, NO, I'm not sure I want to be a guest\"). In case you're wondering if I was dressed like Jed Clampett driving a jalopy, take it on faith I wasn't. It was an unimpressive Hertz Honda Accord - i guess that wasn't up to his standard. Fortunately, my experience at check in was very nice and the room was great. Bellman brought up my bag within two minutes of my arrival and gave a quick overview of the room features. As a Starwood Platinum I was upgraded to a King Suite which was clean, very well appointed and stylish (typical W style and standard). As it was late evening, I opted to eat at one of the two in-house restaurants. Thinking I was entering the bar area of the restaurant, I mistakenly approached the in-house lounge. The bouncer and hostess at the lounge were very polite and offered me the appetizer menu for their area or suggested I consider the adjacent restaurant (\"9:15\") if I wanted a full dinner. I opted for the full restaurant but sat at its bar seating. I had a good martini and had a very good dinner. Appetizer of mushrooms was excellent and the main course (duck) was very good, cooked to order and generous. Prices are towards the high end but not unexpected. Back to the room to do some work in the full size office area and then to bed. In the morning, my shower was more eventful than hoped for as the shower curtain (as others have noted) was determined to wrap, entangle and smother me. I pushed it out of the tub and, post shower, noticed that i left about a gallon of water tubside. When preparing to leave, I called ahead to have my car brought up. I went to the valet area. No car. Spoke to the valet and he asked for my ticket. Then my name. Then my room number. At this point 20+ minutes had elapsed since my call and i'd been standing there for about 10. No apology offered (or expected given the previous night's experience) I went back in and asked for a manager to explain why they couldn't make this simple process of retrieving cars work - especially when they charge $32 a day for parking! (the charge itself isn't an issue for me as I am on expenses, but even for LA hotel parking it is high and, more to the point, it is completely screwed up). All in all, a great experience sandwiched between very poor first and last impressions.

Even though I was wearing a tie and a jacket, I felt uncomfortable just walking up the steps to the front door. I expected to see a nice lobby, essentially a public place that one can check out. Instead, it is really a large foyer, with a check in desk and elevators. I was quickly accosted by an ostensibly friendly large employee who asked \"May I help you?\", but more in the manner that a retail clerk asks if they suspect someone is shoplifting!!

I have stayed in major hotels all over the world, and so I don't think I was overwhelmed or intimidated, but instead I got the impression that this place is stuck on itself as a very \"secure\" place for celebrities, and that the guys in the lobby and the front step area have a Kevin Costner \"bodyguard\" complex. So maybe it is just \"me\" in this case, but I think this place is overly impressed with itself. I have not experienced this at the Beverly Hills Hotel or the Huntington in Pasadena.

Let me begin by saying we do not usually travel to large cities, and quite frankly do not look for that kind of trip. We decided it was due time to see all the glitz and glamour of the Hollywood and Beverly Hills area of LA. This hotel had a great location as far as being an easy drive to anywhere you'd want to go, including the beaches of Santa Monica. Just remember that you will be in Westwood, which is a college town, there will not be stars out the front door. However, when we were at the W they were filming a commercial for Maybeline with Haley Berry, so there goes that idea. The W is a very very \"hip\" and \"cool\" place to relax. As far as service went we had absolutely no problems whatsoever. We did not come across anybody that was \"too good\" to talk to us or to answer our questions. Checkin and out both with smoothly. The Valets were friendly upon arrival/departure and always said something nice or asked if we needed a cab. We never used room service nor did we valet our car. Turns out that there is tons of easy to find street parking around the hotel, so save your $34 unless you will be spending a lot of time in your room in the middle of the day and will be going in and out often. The rooms were great. Exactly how a W should look. We were told that we were upgraded to a corner \"spectacular suite\" because we are platinum preferred Starwood members, and we used our points for this stay. On that note I would never pay the going rate for this room, I would only stay there using points. A few complaints about the room. The shower curtain liner is HORRIBLE. It basically tries to attack you the entire time you are in the shower. You are basically forced to hang it up on the tub and flood the floor of the bathroom. Why they do not have the curved shower curtain rod that even motel 6's have, i have no idea. Ther other complaint is the bed. Its just not comfortable. They claim they have a special W bed, but each morning we woke up with lower back pain. I'd expect a better bed. Road noise from outside is very load. Basically it sounds like the windows are open all the time, but remember, its in the middle of LA, so what can I expect. We were even on the 8th floor, so this was a surprise. As others notied, the Bliss products that you find in the room and in the spa are great. Definately live up to the quality of the hotel and live up to what you expect from a W. There are plenty of places to eat and shop a short walk from the hotel, so thats always nice. Overall its a nice place. Parking in all of LA is a ripoff so no change here. Would we return??

Don't get me wrong: There are some good people working at this hotel. DJ runs the parking extraordinarily well, and Shirley remembers every guest at the restaurant.

Let's be clear: For the price of this two star hotel, you can stay at the five-star Hotel Bel Air (factor in the free parking at the Bel Air), where you will be wowed by the facility, the service and the food. The problem is clearly the management and their decisions, not the workers and their performance.

You can tell that the hotel is sometimes a social scene, as Kim Kardashian (of reality TV fame) was hosting a mother's day party there during my stay. But that did not seem to be the primary focus of the hotel and staff. They seem to have struck a good balance between comfort / service & social activity. The location is also very good - it's easy to walk to Westwood Village and the UCLA campus. Because the neighborhood is residential (and very, very pretty), noise was minimal (normal traffic noise in a big city). My room was a 2-room suite similar to those described by others. It was fine - but impossible to find the light switches at times and the bathroom sink was not the most efficient. But these are minor complaints.

Having stayed at several such hotels (mainly Ws) in the recent past where you have to contend with poorly lit hallways, loud elevator music, strange room layout and lobby area crowded with the \"young happening crowd\" in evenings, I was dreading more of the same. I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel is on a residential area, and doesn't seem to attract the nightclub crowd. The front desk was efficient and helpful at check in, and the concierge was helpful with local walking directions. The hotel isn't too big, so you feel you get personal and efficient service. I stayed in a \"Spectacular\" room, which as others have described, has two parts - one small bedroom with a king bed, a 42\" LCD and night lamps; and a living area with a L shaped sofa, a work desk, a refrigerator, and an entertainment center with another 42\" LCD+DVD player+music system with iPod deck. Overall, it was pretty spacious and bigger than most rooms that I am used to in business trips. The room service was the usual over priced stuff, so I chose to walk down to the nearby shopping area about 10 minutes away. You can take a map from the concierge that will give you locations of various chain restaurants and shops within walking distance. For more distant trips, there is a taxi stand right outside the hotel. Finally, there were some \"triump of style over substance\" things in a hotel that does bill itself to be part of the hippest chain of hotels. The sink in the bath room looks great, but has barely enough space for one person's toiletries. The room has quite a few fancy lamps whose on-off switches will be difficult to find (I gave up on some).

I was thoroughly impressed with this hotel. The last time we were in LA for work we stayed at The Standard on Sunset - now THAT place is overhyped and tries much too hard to be trendy. The W was cool but not too cool. The staff were very friendly, helpful and professional. Check in was a breeze and I was upgraded to a VERY spacious \"Spectacular\" suite - I'm still not too sure why, but I certainly appreciated it. The room was very cosy, comfortable and perfectly functional. The living room had a great L-shaped couch, great colour scheme, interesting artwork and a good size, well positioned desk. The entertainment system was perfect for my needs/wants. A large flat screen TV and a full stereo system with an iPod docking station. The bedroom was comfortable and also included a large flat screen TV as well as a Tivoli bedside clock/radio (I now NEED to get one of those!). The bed was so comfortable... After we were done work we would relax at the Backyard Restaurant which was very chill and not too \"Hollywood\". We were able to enjoy a few beers and snacks and truly relax. Our waiter was attentive but not aggressive or over eager to please. The bar/lounge on the main floor was a great hangout after dinner, until it became a club at about 10pm. They dimmed the lights and pumped up the music. It was just too loud and too young for me. But it seemed to be a VERY popular spot, so if you're into that, you'll like it there. The hotel is located within walking distance to UCLA. Breakfast at Jerry's was great, and there are plenty of other dining choices in the UCLA neighbourhood.

For those of you who have never stayed at a W, it is all about service, as they say, \"Whenever/Whatever.\" We stayed over Easter (4-9 to 4-13) and check in was a breeze. We had 2 rooms and both were a suite. We were able to check in early, given pool views and rooms on the same floor. The suite we each had was a 1 bedroom with a nice size living room that had a wet bar, couch (seating for 4 easily), flat screen TV, DVD player, stereo, desk. The bed room had a queen size bed tightly squeezed into the bedroom with a flat screen on the wall. The TV location made it hard to walk around the bed, but was something I could deal with. The bathroom was a nice size with rain forest shower head that had plenty of power and plenty of hot water. Bath amenities are the standard Bliss lemon/sage. Also the bedroom closet was more than antiquate and had a safe that I could easily fit my lap top, camera and other valuables in. The room was clean and well lite. The windows open for some fresh California (hmm..well sort of fresh) air. I ordered room service each morning and to my surprise each suite has a loud doorbell. With the W's normal standard of service, the room service waiter asked to enter the room and set up everything very nicely. I only ordered a large pot of coffee ($20) and the assortment of 3 pastries ($15), Coffee was fresh as were the pastries. The pool area is a decent size for the hotel, the pool itself small. Plenty of cabanas and lounge chairs. Enjoyed it. Ate at the Backyard and Saturday brunch was $39 and very good. Great salad!! I would recommend for a nice outdoor meal. Great seating area with couches and comfy chairs! Whiskey Blue had a crowd on Saturday night and we had to show our room key to get into the hotel and once again for the elevator. Was crowded and did not visit that night. We did have drinks the first night, $12-$14 a drink, standard LA prices. Valet is very attentive and always willing to give great directions for those traveling without a GPS. Valet is $32 per night with unlimited in/out. Arriving late on evening I found that my room key was not working. You do need a key to get up in the elevator to your room, but my friend's key worked for that. My fault for carrying my key next to my cell phone, but the front desk was helpful -- and keeping a hooker in her place. She was demanding to contact a room (didn't have room number but only a name and it wasn't a full name..hmmmm) and the front desk simply told her she could use the courtesy phone and the operator would connect her to the room if she had the full name .. The lovely hooker in her fashionable cut off shorts and extremal high heels used some colorful language that allowed security to remove her. I like the idea that they do take care of their guest's security and volume levels. It allows a relaxing time. The rooms are quite and the do tell you in the in room guide that no parties are allowed in the suites and violators will be evicted. So if you are coming here to have a big party -- better think twice! I liked this as it allows you to sleep in peace!!! This hotel has excellent customer service at all points of contact. People are friendly and seem to enjoy their job! I would recommend this hotel to everyone who is planning on visiting Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, UCLA, Hollywood and Santa Monica..close to all.

Staff is very kind and attentive, they definitely have a little \"Hollywood\" edge to them, but are very helpful & kind. However, be prepared to spend money...lot's of money if hanging out at the hotel and pool. It's hard not to spend $20 just walking around the place. Spend a couple hours at the pool and you'll be down a hundred or so bucks in a heartbeat. I went there expecting everything to be expensive, but I blew through money so quick it was scary. In addition, this may sound odd, but as nice as the room and atmosphere was...it really got on my nerves after a full day of hanging out. The best way I could describe it is that it's a place for every Hollywood \"Wannabe\" and the occasional actual movie or TV star to visit. You go out to the pool, and every local wannabe movie star, singer, or otherwise comes there to be seen, and I mean \"be seen\". The sights are incredible and WELL worth the time at the pool (do not bring someone under the age of 17 to the pool). However, the fakeness is so thick it'll gag you...it's like being at a live Broadway show, but you're in real life. The girls and guys are top notch, but they also feel like they ALL have to act the part - all the time, which get's annoying. They even set-up a fake security force (it's real security, but not at ALL needed) with velvet ropes outside of the hotel at night with guys having the ear-piece radios and everything to keep the \"lesser cool\" crowd out of the hotel lounges/clubs. It's kind of funny to watch because it makes you feel like you're going to the most exclusive hang-out in the world, but it's really not - it's just a show so they feel like they're one of those super exclusive Hollywood clubs...again, all the \"Wannabe's\" come rolling back in for the night shift. I know this review sounds crazy, but it's one of those things you have to \"see to believe\". It's a great place to stay and experience a great atmosphere - but if you go there to hang out all day/night, it will drive you crazy and cost tons of money unless you have 6-pack abs, and a face of gold, a million dollar wardrobe, and another million sitting in the bank.

My wife knew someone at another Starwood property that got us upgraded to a Fabulous Suite. This was the second best type of suite and featured 2 big flat screens, an office, living room and bedroom.

We saw Reggie Miller the first night and we were told by a poolside waitress that Samantha Ronson (Lindsay Lohan's gf) was djing the night before we arrived and her and Lindsay were hanging out. I think it was a good thing that we missed that. The outdoor pool area becomes a little lounge / restaurant and is draws a nice crowd. On Sunday evenings they show an old movie on this huge projector and people just lounge out with drinks. Speaking of the pool, don't expect to do laps. We're talking tiny; about the size of the plastic bath tub your mother used to bath you in when you were 1. There are cabanas avail. for rent for for about $200 a day, plus drinks.

I found the valet person, bell-hop person, security, and room service person to be very nice. We were thinking of going out to Hollywood or Santa Monica to party, but ended at the hotel bar which was perfect. It was surprising spacious, had good music, and a dance floor. Also, because I am an SPG Gold Member I was able to check-in early and check-out early which was much appreciated. Rooms service was fast and we ordered something not on the menu ant they were able to make it happen. Also, the hotel knew it was my birthday and sent complimentary snacks and alcoholic beverages as well as birthday card. Finally, all the rooms were on the same floor which was quite convenient. Cons - Not to many cons, just little things that prevented a score of \"Excellent.\" First, we had some champagne we were planning to bring in and enjoy in the room. We were told that's not allowed because of city mandate and because the W is such a high profile hotel. Upon leaving, I was told by another employee that it was simply because the hotel wanted the income from the minibar. I didn't appreciated the inconsistencies. Second, the front desk staff/manager didn't exactly exude a warm demeanor. There is something to be said about being nice and welcoming.

PRICE: I paid $279 for one night and the other night I used my 12,000 SPG points. ****Suggestion****** If you use points only, you might not get an upgrade. Since I paid for a night and I asked the booking agent to put a note on my file to request an upgrade, I was being upgraded to a suite, which was very comfortable and spacious. However, the best deal is to use points and cash, which is $89 a night and 4,000 points. So for 2 nights you will end up using 8,000 points and only $180 but you need to book ahead to avoid blackout dates. PARKING: Some attacked the $31 valet parking fee but I found it being rather fair, considering we have in and out privilege, and we stayed for 2 nights 3 days there but W only charge $62 for about 20 times in and out. POOL area is VERY nice and hip with great music; fruit juice/apples for free. BREAKFAST: Smoked salmon bagel for $13 very good portion of smoked salmon; Lobster Omlette $20 had good serving of lobster meat and mascarpone cheese in the middle, yummy! BAR: Very happening at night, HIP, good gimlet, had a great cucumber martini there, $12 each which every nice corner bar in LA charge at least $10 anyways so at the W it isn\u2019t that bad. SHOWER: The shower head is amazing with the best water pressure ever! BLISS shower gel and face wash is very refreshing. BED: My best sleep for the longest time. Heavenly!

One f the worse hings of ths W is the elevators - every doubel I have stayed out in the US (over 12....you wait forever!!). I doubt get it!!

The hotel is okay, I think we paid near $400 for our room, which was a large suite. Coming from NYC, the size of the rooms are impressive. But I had the most horrible experience. I left my sunglasses and video ipod, priced around $700 in total, in the pocket of a robe. I had spent the afternoon by the pool and upon going back to my room, I placed the ipod and sunglasses (in a large pearl case) in the pocket of my robe. I hung up the robe on the bathroom door and took a shower. The following morning, when i checked out, I forgot to take the items from the robe. The next day, I realized I had forgotten my items in the robe in the bathroom. I called the hotel several times. The first time, I spoke with an agent named William who said he would conduct an investigation and give me a call right back. He did not call me back. So I called later in the evening and spoke to another agent who called me back within 10 minutes and said the items had not been found. Which was peculiar to me because I know for certain that i left them there. The next day, I called to talk to manager at the hotel. I spoke directly to the manager's assistant who assured me she would look further into the matter and get back to me as soon as possible. This was almost 3 weeks ago and I have heard nothing. It was a very bad experience for me because I think that hotels should be accountable and not take their customer's belongings that they overlook. I have never had an experience like this where i was not able to reclaim forgotten merchandise in a hotel room. Im dissappointed in the hotel and their staff for their lack of professionalism. I know that an ipod and sunglasses are not the end of the world, and thankfully it was not a much more important personal belonging. My advice is, avoid this hotel. It is overpriced and not worth the hassle.

I had a small problem getting a light bulb replaced in the room (it took a call to the front desk, then two follow-up calls on their part to see if it had been done before it was actually accomplished), but I don't consider a burnt-out bulb to be a big problem, so fixing it right away wasn't something that irritated me. So I might agree that perhaps the staff is not up to the typical W standard for coordination, but I did not at any time find anyone unprofessional or rude. I lived in Westwood for a while and feared that the location would mean lots of noise and drunken carousing outside, but their street is away from Westwood Village and very quiet. The building seems nestled in a private jungle, and I found that its reputation for being dark was well-deserved. At night, they keep the lobby area relatively dim and use projections on the wall for decoration. I was impressed by the execution of this, since it can be glaring if not well integrated. The use of projection along with the closed-circuit tv in the elevator (not recorded or monitored, just for entertainment inside the elevator) is a nice nod to \"The Industry\" of the host city. The rooms are very big for hotel rooms (I had the lowest level of room), and while it is true that they do not have lots of light fixtures, during the daytime, the windows that ran along the entire side of the room (and open wide) let in plenty of light. But yes, at night, the rooms seem kind of dark. The decor is nice, but a bit reserved for a W. Again though, there is a tie-in with Los Angeles in the photos of the city at night that adorn the walls. The bathrooms are huge, and have a stand apart from the vanity for locating your own toiletries. That's a nice touch. As for the staff, I found everyone to be amazingly friendly, putting forth a lot of effort to achieve the W goal of making you feel like you're coming home when you arrive at the curb. The welcome ambassador (or whatever they call them) that greeted us upon arrival remembered my name, my interests, some amazingly obscure details from brief conversations we had and offered some amazing tips each time I passed through the doors. As for the Internet access not working, I first experienced that problem, but when they sent an engineer up to the room, he explained that the little black boxes that are inline between the ethernet from the wall and your computer often fail, so if you just use the blue ethernet cable from the wall and plug it directly into your computer, it works like a charm. I am surprised at the report from the previous reviewer that had employees talking about it being a widespread problem, since even the bellhop seemed to think that might be the problem before the engineer arrived. Perhaps they only recently discovered this workaround. Pros: Amazing welcome staff, friendly (if not well-coordinated) staff in other areas, lush surroundings, good public area design, beautiful views, that killer W bed Cons: Expensive parking rates ($24/day, I think), dark rooms (at night; maybe a pro for some), not very funky room elements for a W, although I felt the lobby made up for this", "Date": "November 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat rooms- poor service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4040955", "Content": "All rooms are suites and well decorated, but the staff is not service-oriented.

Typically, we stay at Le Meridien Beverly Hills, but wanted to mix it up this time and got two suites at the W Hotel LA in Westwood. (They only have suites, no rooms, which is nice) We paid $430 a night and our friend spent over $1100 for the two nights. The hotel itself is beautifully decorated, although it was a little too dark inside. My friend suggested the dim lighting was to prevent guests from noticing the fact that the building was slightly run down, but I don't agree. There is two pools - a main pool where everyone lounges and a smaller pool off of the gym. I'd recommend coming early to guarantee a lounge chair at the main pool, otherwise you'll end up having to rent one of their cabans for $200/hr. And that is probably why they allow many of the lounge chairs to sit empty for hours just because someone had reserved it with their towel. You can also enjoy a nice lunch at the restaurant by the pool. Make sure you order a mojito. BTW, the gym is very nice and well equipped with free weights as well. The rooms themselves are spacious and the beds are very comfortable. The walls are obviously very thick as you can't hear your neighbours. Scott, at the Conceirge is also very helpful. For example, he got us last minute dinner reservation at Koi and got my friend (female) into some of the hippest night clubs in LA. It didn't hurt that she was blonde and stacked. However, there were serious problems: 1. They misplaced a pair of jeans I had laundered and didn't really seem to care about it. However, the jeans were eventually recovered (by my own efforts) but they didn't charge me for the service. 2. They initially placed us in a room with a handicap shower, i.e. a nozzle attached to a hose which you had to hold when you showering - very annoying. We had to move to a room with a 'normal' shower. 3. Before heading out for the evening, we had requested clean towels. When we returned, we discovered a stack of clean towels on the bathroom sink and a pile of damp towels still sitting in the tub. We called downstairs and informed them that we were going to put the used towels in the hall way and asked them to send someone up to pick them up. At that time, the night manager (who had only been there for 2 months) threaten to throw us out of the hotel if we did that. I have never have been threaten to be kicked out of a hotel ever. When I went downstairs to confront the night manager, he was agressive, hostile and rude. There was no apology or attempts to resolve the situation in an appropriate manner. Furthermore, we had requested a bliss kit, i.e. a package of the mini-shampoo, lotion, etc... you get in your room. What we got was a brown paper bag with several of the little bottles sitting in our sink. Overall the experience was fine. However, that experience with the night manager soured our entire stay.

I had to call the concierge because there was no list of dvd's in the room. She told me to look for a W book with list inside. There wasn't a W book. she promised to send one up. It never arrived. I had to call her TWO MORE TIMES to get the list of dvd's. list arrived: I ordered. 11) someone brings up film -- its not a dvd -- its video. I send it back. I don't have a vcr.

The suites are all done in W style--which I think lacks personality and could use some splashes of color--color which is strangely absent from this hotel in its entirety. I question whether the furniture was completely new due to the rather staggering number of stains on the upholstery in both rooms I had. I had one of the larger suites--three rooms--a living room, bedroom and office--which face the rear of the hotel and was much more quiet and serene than anything facing the street or overlooking the pool area....which was the fate of several of my co-workers. This is a scene hotel--the lobby bar is packed with pretty young things and there are a steady stream of hipper than thou young people who party hearty. You'd do well to avoid any room on a lower floor in front or overlooking the pool. The noise is such that one of my co-workers had to be moved in the middle of the night. But the problem here isn't the rooms with their excellent beds-- it's the service or almost complete lack of it. I came home at 8:00 to find two maids in the room giving it the first housekeeping service of the day! There is no turndown service at all which might solve the ice shortage... I waited up to 45 minutes for ice from room service The only competent service is in the Parking Garage...everyone else gives attitude and looks pretty and that's about it. One bellman promised to look after two things for me and never appeared again. The other problem here is that the the menu is extremely limited and unchanging from brunch to lunch to dinner. What is served is certainly passable but no one would want to eat there 9 days straight which was our fate. The main restaurant, which we were assured would be open, was not. The outdoor restaurant is the only option and in the flooding rains of last week, was forced indoors to take up a position in some conference rooms on the second floor. There tables were set for 8 and 12 so you were forced to sit with strangers--not my idea of a good time. The only option to this unattractive arrangement was room service and the delays were horrific -- 45 minutes for abowl oif cereal and juice and this with a 20% service charge attached to it. Amazingly, one young bartender told me that they had staffed up in preparation for the opening of the restaurant. Why these waiters weren't pressed into service to cope with the room service is beyond me. This really is a sad state of affairs at a hotel that could be so much better. I think service in this Hotel seems to suffer from the fact that there is only one professional waiter (Moses) in the bunch--the rest are all incredibly cute boys and girls who clearly have no intention of staying longer than it takes to pay for their head shots. I do feel badly about writing this. But it's just a dirty rotten shame that this place hasn't got its act together. If I were W management, I wouldn't allow this place to denigrate my brand the way it does. I'll wait here to read whether it ever lives up to its potential.", "Date": "October 25, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHated It!\u201d", "Author": "diving4gold", "ReviewID": "UR2703687", "Content": "Don't bother wasting your money on this one.

The rooms are adequate, but the walls are paper thin, the traffic noise from outside is terrible (no double glazing) and it was especially disappointing to hear the staff cleaning the next-door room at midnight with the stereo on full-tilt! The pool staff are hilariously bad, way too cool to actually do their job and find somewhere for you to sit - prefer to just grunt at people and tell people where they can't sit! Reading other reviews, it seems to be a regular occurrence to close the swimming pool and the bar down for private events, leaving nowhere for the guests to go. Indeed when we stayed there a couple of weeks ago, the whole hotel was taken over by a film crew and we were even banished from the lobby!!
