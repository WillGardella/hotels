This is a relatively new hotel -- opened about 2 years ago, I believe. Check in was easy and the person at the desk was very courteous. The room was clean, and it was spacious. I opted for a king size bed, which left plenty of room to walk around. There was a comfortable chair in the corner for lounging, as well as a desk for work. The room included a small refrigerator (not stocked) and an well appointed bathroom with a large walk in shower. There were two sets of pillows on the bed -- one marked soft and the other marked firm. Unfortunately, neither were to my liking, but I made do with what I had. I had a glass of wine in the bar before calling it a night -- it was a generous glass. The hotel has a small fitness room ( a stationary bike, 2 treadmills and an elliptical), and the fitness room is open 24 hours a day. There is also a business center that has a couple of computers and printers. The restaurant offers a buffet or order off the menu options in the morning. As I was not there for lunch or dinner, I do not know what those menus are like. I opted for the buffet, which had a nice selection of cold and hot foods, including beverages. The price, as I recall, was about $12. The food was good. All in all, this was a good place to stay -- convenient to where my meeting was, and it offers easy access to where ever you may want to go in Phoenix as it is just off University near the 143. I don't know that one room or another matters, but I was in room 204 -- it was certainly quiet.

The buffet was around $11 per person, which was a bit pricey for the food provided, but was the quickest option. Many of the items, such as cereal, juice, coffee were fine.

Eventually, I made the desk clerk guide me to one of the several bits of S. 48th Street in the area. Once there, the people were very nice. The bartender lent me her bottle opener so I could open the beer I had in my room. The hotel is clean and bright. The room was good-sized and had pillows labeled as firm or soft. The firm pillows were very firm. The bed was reasonably comfortable. The only real problem was the noise, and not from airplanes. This is one of those hotels where the doors slam closed unless you're careful. This woke both my daughter and me on several occasions. Also, while it's nice to have microwaves in the room, they are perhaps the loudest, beepingest microwaves I've seen. You can easily hear them in the next room.

Thankfully the Holiday Inn was running a shuttle service and so we hitched a ride. The hotel is much closer to the airport than I imagined, which is convenient. We were able to get booked into a room with no reservation. The man at the counter was very helpful and even scrounged up a baby bed for us and because our flight had been canceled he helped us with a discounted rate and included breakfast which took away some of the sting of not being home after a long day. The room was nice and clean, and comfortable with a large shower. The next morning the people working the restaurant area were very friendly and helpful, and the shuttle driver came and loaded up our luggage while we ate.

I use Holiday Inn Express Hotels a lot, but I try to steer clear of the regular Holiday Inn branded hotels as I have been often disappointed by old properties in need of renovation. However, this Holiday Inn is very new. My stay started well with a very friendly greeting at the front desk. The lobby is beautiful - a step above what you typically find at this price level. The room was large,with a comfortable work area. The wireless internet speed was the fastest I have ever had at a hotel (and free). The beds were great, the bathroom large, and all were well-cleaned. I had a room service dinner one night. Though what was labelled as shrimp scampi was really shrimp with pasta alfredo, it was really tasty. The food arrived quickly. The menu prices were very reasonable. There is a 20% gratuity automatically added, but no service up charge from the regular dining room menu prices. There is a small bar area on the first floor. It's intimate and comfortable. Prices were reasonable and the bar tender friendly and accomodating even though the place was full. Breakfast, as at all Holiday Inns (non-Express) is not complimentary. One morning I had the buffet for $9.95, and thought I got good value. The only two downsides (minor): The scrambled eggs were overcooked (a pet peeve) and the one waiter was a little overwhelmed, so my plate was not cleared and I had to chase him to get my check. If I had time, I would have ordered from the a la carte menu to get freshly cooked eggs. NOTE: you can see the kitchen from the buffet area, and it was clean. There is a huge selection of restaurants within a 5 minute drive. I don't think there are any within easy walking distance. One minor complaint: Parking is tight.

The hotel is about 10 minutes from the airport adjacent to the freeway in a corporate park area. It is away from the flight path, so no noise from airplanes flying overhead. The hotel is brand new, and was probably built within the last year. It has the new design theme of Holiday Inn and will blow away all of your past connotations of the shabby Holiday Inns of the 1980s. The design of the hotel exterior, lobby and rooms is sleek and modern. The front desk is more like a kiosk....it's a smaller hotel, so it works. The rooms have an upscale look reminiscent of Westin and Wyndham. Even the bathrooms have granite counters and large, stone tiled bath areas. My only complaint about the sleeping rooms, was that it does not come with an in-room safe. All of the other essential amenities are there - wi-fi, mini-fridge, microwave, coffee maker, iron and iron board and hair dryer. Other reviewers have complained about the restaurant, and quite frankly, it is small. It can maybe seat 50 guests (there is a small buffet area during breakfast in the rear), so if there is a group staying at the hotel, it can easily get too busy there. My suggestion is to avoid staying at this hotel if there is a group of more than 15 rooms staying there....the property is just not designed to handle groups. Otherwise, the hotel really is beautiful, and I hope all Holidays Inns around the country are going for this new look.

If you like this location for a specific reason but want to reduce the noise, you could ask for a room in the back which does not face 143. It is very easy to get to and located on a street that is not busy at all. Once you pull out onto University Ave it was a straight shot to Ash Ave (street?) where I parked. It was a total of 2.5 miles. This was very nice. Upon check-in I was greeted by two nice gentlemen. It ended up I was given the wrong key card but it happens and when I went back down to get another, I was given a free drink card for my trouble. The room was a king. It was nicely appointed with a large clean bathroom and wonderful amenities from Bath and Body. I think the shampoo and conditioner were coconut and verbena or lime. There was a new large LG TV. It had a large refrigerator which I used and a microwave which I did not use. There was a coffee machine but the coffee was not good. Downstairs has better coffee. The bed was a little firm for me and the pillows were ok. I was too tired to really care. The only thing that sort of irked me was the breakfast. Originally, I had made reservations months in advance using AAA at $145. It came with continental breakfast. I was searching again just for kicks and found that the AAA rate for the same room had gone down to $108. Well, naturally I changed over. I was not made aware that at this rate there is no continental breakfast and it never occurred to me that it would change. When I went downstairs for the first time to get breakfast, I did what I always do at hotels with CB, I went to the buffet and started to get my food. Well, the young man attending the buffet area appeared to be more attentive than I cared for. I like to be left alone in the morning as this is not really my time of day. One thing led to another and finally it was made clear that breakfast was not free; I had to have a card. I clarified with the desk and was told that at my rate, breakfast was not included. Now, I got such a good rate and breakfast was only $11.00 that I really did not care about the money and I was still in the better with the rate change. However, I would have liked to be made aware of it and further what they offered was not quite worth this price. It also did not include tip which I did not leave this time because 1) expensive for what I got 2) I don\u2019t need someone asking me if I need anything off a buffet. Now, if you are a simple person and like A LOT of eggs and sausage or A LOT of fruit (which was quite tasty) then you might think the price is not so bad.

Sleep Quality: beds & pillows very comfortable; beds are firm but have a cushion top or fluffy mattress pad and are very comfortable for sleepers in any position; pillows come in firm or soft, but if you prefers a different thickness of pillow call the front desk as they have different pillows available. This hotel is very close to the airport, but is very quiet; we did not hear planes unless we were out in the pool.

Value: hotel was a great value; breakfast buffet (fresh juices included) a little pricey ($9.95 at the time) but was worth it, and our kids ate free, so it was about $5 pp. Our server was very nice and willing to assist; food was delicious; cook offered to make additional waffles for us.
