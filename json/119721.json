Expect to call maintenance at least once a day for something not working (toilet would not stop rumming, bathtub would not drain, cordless phone never worked.) Expect smokers in the rooms below rooms 521 and 523 which prevents you from using the balcony in any way. Expect to pay an excessive amount for parking. Expect to pay cash for the yellow cabs contracted to the hotel (even though there are stickers in the window showing credit card logos.) Expect unannounced tree maintenance at the pool the day you decide to stay on the property. Yes, this property is close to sea world. But my advice is to stay clear of this Hilton.

We travelled with two young kids, mixing business and family stay. We chose a garden view twin room, in one of the villas. Very happy with the room - good size, very comfortable, had a fridge microwave and sink which was good for looking after the kids' needs. Our view was over the back garden which was basically a fence, so that was not so hot, but we didn't mind. The resort itself is very good. It's not Dubai, so don't expect a never ending buffet and marble pillars, but the resort does itself justice. The pool is heated, and the depth is 3 - 5 feet so the kids could touch the bottom in areas. There are two wonderful hot tubs just off the pool, a table tennis table and a giant draughts set. It's very picturesque and the sunset over the bay is an attractive sight. There's a motor boat, jetski kayak rental on the beach, which we didn't use as the weather was not great. The beach is a manmade looking one, but it's fine for the kids. Jogging or rollerblading along the bayfront is fun, and there are bikes to rent. There's a very good children's playground about 7-10 mins walk along the waterfront. We travelled downtown to the convention centre, to balboa park and the zoo, as well as to seaworld - all by taxi, very easy short trips. Fashion mall is much better the name sounds, and has some good toy shops as well as a wide range of clothing. Food choices in the hotel are good, for both adults and kids, and the room service choices are good too. it's fairly gourmet and the quality is quite high. As it's off season now, we didn't have the full choice of dining as some of the venues were not open. The best thing about the hotel is the staff - exceptionally friendly and happy to please - Larry in the restaurant and Ramon on the front desk were great, but all the staff create a happy, easy going and helpful environment. The only annoying thing about the hotel is the lack of in room wifi - we went to the onsite convention centre to login to free wifi. Amenities - a very good hotel shop, helpful reception and conceriege, business centre, fed ex package handling, hotel shuttle - very helpful and individualised service, great value on zoo and sea world tickets (prices similar but many additional perks included esp sea world multi entry) Why not 5 stars - well it's just a little old, the choices are just a little limited compared to modern resort hotels esp in the Middle East and Asia, but the staff make up for all of this - it deserves a 4.5 rating.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "DiamondGirl419", "Title": "\u201cNice property---great value!\u201d", "Author": "DiamondGirl419", "ReviewID": "UR126464289", "Content": "We booked this hotel through Priceline on a $79 per night bid. We weren't sure what to expect because of some of the reviews on Trip Advisor, but I can say that I was pleased with this property. We were assigned a room on the 6th floor tower across from the lobby and had wonderful views of Mission Bay and beyond. The balcony was furnished with a table and 2 chairs and made for quiet mornings as the sun came up. Our room was beautifully appointed--the room and bathroom appeared to have been the result of a recent remodel. Very comfy bed with a nightlite attached to the headboard for those who want to read if your traveling companion wants to sleep. Check-in was very easy and quick. We purchased coffee and yogurt every morning and both were delicious. Lunch at poolside was great---we had waitresses so you could order adult beverages and foods such as grilled chicken sandwiches or burgers. The prices were about the same as any other resort we've been to. We took a taxi service to this hotel from the airport rather than rent a car. Not worth renting a car since you have to pay for parking here as well as the cost of a rental. We were only staying here 2 nights as a layover on our way to Maui. The hotel does offer a shuttle service to Old Town San Diego and SeaWorld for free. Other destinations are available for a fee. This property is well landscaped and cared for. I loved it because I felt like we were on our own island area...very private even though you could look out past the property gates and watch all the joggers, walkers and runners on the paved path along Mission Bay. Hilton also has bike rentals and I believe boats of some sort too ( I saw a dock with Hilton's name on it).. When we were here, it was off-season, so the cabanas were free to sit under...Nice touch...69-72 degrees all day...just perfect! The only thing I can address with concern is that the hot tub was MUCH too hot. Most guests here complained about it. Yes, it should be more hot than warm, but this was very, very hot (and I CAN take a lot of heat)....So if I'm sayin' it's hot...it's WAY hot.

Typically when I travel on business, or for a conference I stay at a Marriott and commute or walk to the other location. Because the Hilton is out on its own, and is a beautiful resort property we opted to stay onsite. After reading reviews about the price of parking we decided it'd be more cost effective to use a taxi to get from the airport, and to visit other areas. For our 3 night stay we ended up spending about $100 on taxi fares. This was to get to and from the airport, as well as round trip taxi service to and from Old Town, and Pacific Beach. I believe this was still much less expensive than the cost of a rental car, along with gas, and $32 a day parking which is highly excessive! Unfortunately San Diego is a driving town, and not having a car made us feel trapped. There are no restaurants, are markets even remotely close. You are pretty much required to only eat, drink, and buy any odds and ends you may need at the hotel. We needed sunscreen and paid $18 for it! Our room was located in the Tower on floor 4, and overlooked the lobby and driveway area, so we did not have a view. The rooms are decent, and the bed is pretty comfortable. However I think the rooms were designed by a man, as there was no full length mirror or decent lighting, something I desire when staying at a hotel. The room felt like a Vampires Liar. Another issue that did not affect us but did cause difficulty for other conference attendees was the cost of the internet, apparently not wireless in the room, and $15 a day. We had a 3G iPad, Thank Goodness! Now that my complaints are out of the way, I do think it's important to address the positives of this hotel. First and foremost is the service. The hotel staff is wonderful! Everyone is so nice and helpful. I did not run into one discourteous representative of this hotel, and I was there for almost four days straight so this says a lot. While I didn't get to use the pool area, it looked amazing! Luckily I was able to use the running path around the bay, which was great. The west side of the property was beautiful! I think this resort would be a great place to stay with your family, in one of the condo/suites on the bay side of the hotel. They appear to be fully equipped with kitchens, so you could prepare your own meals, pending you had a car to go to the market. I personally don't think I'd stay at this property again because of the parking. It's very expensive at $32 a day, and I just would never be willing to pay that along with a $200 plus per night room cost, and I'd never go to suburban San Diego again without a car. If they lowered their parking cost to say $15, I'd highly recommend this place for families. I'd also recommend it to you if money is no object.

We ordered a late dinner and had it brought to the room and the next morning went to the restaurant for breakfast. The prices were a little high but that was to be expected. One downside is that my wife and I were forgotten at breakfast.

Nice location setting, the main staff including the valet/bus speak clear English, maid service is great and what a beautiful room (773)in the tower with 'bay view'.

So here now for 4 days, I clearly see I spent too much money on a 5 day/night vacation stay considering what I'm experiencing for that money. Never mind $32.day for parking. The rooms are over priced...period. The add-ons, should you want some are priced beyond belief. Example: I thought the room had a microwave. When I learned at check in that the rooms don't include one, they offered to send one up to the room AT $30 PER DAY. Walmart up the road sells them for $38. Do you need to use a few \"business services\" like internet, printing, scanning a document or use of a small room? FORGET it. They'll tell you they have rooms specifically to do your work in, right before they admit \"but they don't have any furniture in them\". Though they boost a confernce center, they have NOTHING to support it except for a few big rooms and many chairs. So I asked the front desk (you HAVE to go there if you need to ask them something...they DON'T answer their phone but 1 out of 8 times so far). Their wireless system is ONE router for the whole complex so you have to find a place to sit close to the center of the resort.

The gift shop here said they discounted tickets. Oh they do...normally the tickets are $73. they discount them $1, so we spent $72 per. There was a lot of walking that day, so we'd thought we'd relax and splash around after a late dinner and activities. Wrong!... the pool area closes at 10 so we couldn't unwind in the hot tub or float around in the pool like you can at most other resorts/hotels of much lesser class.

I had site toured the Hilton last year for a large conference and knew our attendees were going to love it. What better way to know for sure than to stay there myself as a guest, with no business to worry about! We arrived a little early and our room on the bay was ready for us. Great view with a covered patio leading right out to the beach. The bathroom was huge and had all the amenities. We had a rental car and drove to Old Town for dinner and came back for drinks at the Olive Lounge. The berry martini was amazing! The next morning we ordered room service, which was great and then headed to Spa Brezza for Swedish massages. It was beautiful inside, again with all the amenities. And the massages were wonderful! Our friends chose to work out in the fitness center. While I'm sure they enjoyed using all the equipment, I'm happy we went for relaxation instead! Not living near the ocean, it was nice to stay right on the bay. I would take that over staying inland any day. If you do your homework and plan ahead, getting around is not a problem, and we never drove more than 10 mins to get anywhere and there is amble parking throughout the city (we paid $3 to park while we walked around Old Town). Parking at a resort anywhere in a large city is pricey, but we enjoyed our stay immensely and would recommend it to anyone wanting to enjoy San Diego.

Great looking pool area (although cool weather made it unusable for me, not their fault obviously), but in different conditions, I would have used it much more (there are jacuzzis, a larger pool, table tennis, etc. 7. You can rent a bike and other water sport equipment right at the resort. I did that twice, and took a ride over to Fiesta Island or along Mission Bay. Very nice. 8. Room was clean and cleaned well each day. Again, I want to emphasize the staff were all first rate, professional and courteous. BAD: 1. No wireless in rooms (a hotel of this scale should have wireless in the rooms, being tethered to an 8 inch ethernet cord on the \"desk\" was a real hassle). 2. No business style desk. Very small surface space with an uncomfortable chair. They would do well to cater a little more to business travelers (wireless, a decent desk and comfortable desk chair would go a long way). A couple of other minus: 3. The door entering my building would never lock closed, so anyone could walk off the beach and into the building without a key card, didn't leave me feeling very secure. 4. Overnight parking for guests is $28 per night (pretty ridiculous for a location that isn't downtown), it effectively doubles your rental car costs. 5. Ducks were in the pool most of the time I was there (pretty gross), pool area unstaffed. 6. There is a Marketplace onsite for snacks, but be prepared to pay a lot, i.e. $2.50 for a Dr. Pepper, $9.00 for a bag of chips and a Naked Juice, $15 for a small bundle of wood for my fire pit. 7. Other charges to be aware of, wired internet access is $11.95 per day (unless it is comped b/c of your Hilton Honors status). That, plus paying for overnight parking adds $40 a night to your price, good to keep in mind if you are following a budget. BTW, $11.95 is per device. UGLY: My one negative experience with a staff decision was when I took the complimentary shuttle to SeaWorld when I had a free morning. It is advertised as leaving every morning at 10. I scheduled my short time at SeaWorld and the shows as exact as I could to maximize my time, knowing we were 5 minutes from SeaWorld. Once we were on the shuttle, the driver announced he was going to take someone to the airport and we would \"get a tour of San Diego\" So, once underway, instead of turning right for a 3 minute drive to the Sea World entrance (again, very close to the hotel), the driver decided to turn left and drove me and two other guests who also got on the shuttle to go to SeaWorld, all the way to the San Diego airport to drop off a fourth passenger who wasn't in any particular hurry to get to the airport. Instead of a 5 minute drive to SeaWorld we took a 35 minute drive to SD airport, missing the first morning show at the park. Very disrespectful of the three passengers going to Sea World and unnecessary, by the admission of the fourth passenger who was going to the airport, and hadn't requested a rush. OVERALL: If you have a family, its a nice central location to SeaWorld, LegoLand, Zoo, etc. and located on the beach. Potentially romantic location for a couple, esp. if you get a bayside with the two chaise lounges and fire pit. The rooms/overall space isn't really designed for business people, but could provide a wonderful respite for them, if the room design and amenities would cater more to business clients vs. just vacationing guests.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, Virginia, United States", "Title": "\u201cMy Third Visit to the Hilton Resort & Spa on Mission Bay\u201d", "Author": "Ed G", "ReviewID": "UR121520676", "Content": "I had a fun and relaxing stay this week, my third visit!

Our rooms were peaceful and in great locations looking out onto the bay. There is the wonderful and sunny park located next to the resort on both sides of the property. Perfect for walking or jogging. Plus it's relaxing to just watch the kayakers, rowers, and boarders. The property was beautifully maintained- pool area (beautiful with the clean and updated cabanas), and hot, clean hot tubs. Everything was just great. The staff (all of them, front desk, restaurant folks, front desk manager, maintenance people) were extremely nice, helpful and professional. We dined twice in the beautiful California-style restaurant. Just great!! The patio dining was perfect, beautiful weather, etc. We did not want to leave! Yes this is a resort, and yes resorts are typically more expensive than regular hotels. There is a spa onsite with beauty and massage services, and there is rental for bicycles and other fun stuff.

My co worker and I start tearing up the room in search for the ring. We hear house keeping and ask these workers to start help as well. The staff did not think twice and dropped what they were doing and started to help look. The ring is not in the room?? We decide to go checkout and go to the front desk to talk to the staff. The management staff was so concerned and immediately took my info, asked me questions and took the time to talk to me. They then advised me to go to security and do a report as well. We go to security, describe the ring and the security personal goes in back and comes back up with a white envelope. He opens the envelope and pulled out the ring!!! Once I collected myself and my heart goes back in my chest, I grab the ring and put in on my finger. He explained it must have some how fallen off my finger (has never done this in the 2 years I have worn it) and the cleaning crew found it under the conference table. In leaving for the airport, the management saw me leaving and took the time to make sure it was found and followed up with me. WOW!! What service and care.

We were very disappointed with the hotel, having been impressed with the hotel website and photographs. Where to start.... location is poor as there is very little else nearby, aside from the bay. We did not have a car rental and had to rely solely on taxis. You could not go anywhere by foot. Every aspect of the hotel and it's operation is designed for you to spend your money within the hotel. The hotel shuttle bus is very expensive, and most times it was cheaper to use an ordinary taxi. The bus does not leave until 10am earliest therefore forcing you to pay for breakfast at either the restaurant (also very expensive) or the coffee shop (also expensive). The coffee shop bizarely closes at 1:00pm, obviously as a ploy to make sure you buy your lunch and drinks from the poolside (unsurprisingly, expensive). The reception and concierge staff (with the exception of william who was superb) were generally unhelpful and on one occasion I was completely ignored whilst waiting to speak to reception. I sat down with one female concierge for help with our holiday such as sight seeing etc and she just wasn't interested or helpful and didn't even bother giving us any information. We struggled until William helpfully gave us a restaurant list, leaflets for Seaworld etc which surely could have been given to us by the previous concierge- she basically just didn't want to help. The pool side staff were rude and on one occasion didn't bother bringing back our change having paid our bill- she just assumed we were leaving her an 11 dollar tip even though we only had one sandwich and two sodas. When we asked for our change she appeared shocked and then 15 minutes later(!!) finally brought over our change (all in 1 dollar notes to be sure we were able to leave her a tip of course). The hotel is old and looks dingy save for the fact that a small fortune appears to have been spent on modern furniture to spruce the place up. The room was nice but the bathrooms were outdated. The rooms were very dark with poor lighting. Hotel and pool cleanliness was poor, especially the hot tub in the adult area.

It is presented as an upscale resort style hotel and we splurged for a garden villa, expecting a true Hilton experience. I am sorry to say, we were disppointed and felt misled by the resort presentation on the Hilton website. First of all, the hotel seemed to be trying to squeeze money out of its guests at every turn. The website says each room features high speed internet. Nowhere is a mention of this being not free. Only when you click on individual rooms' info, do they have a tiny notice saying there might be additional fees. By the way, the internet connection is per cable (no wireless) and costs $11.95 per 24 hours. The breakfast is not included in the price of the room and adds up quickly, as does the parking charge of $28 per night. There is an outdoor pool on the property, with a small paddling pool for toddlers next to it. There are lounge chairs around the pool, free of charge, and then shaded cabanas that need to be rented and reserved in advance. I didn't ask how much they were to rent, but considering that there was no mention of the actual price anywhere in the hotel add or the notice at the pool, AND the outrageous prices of poolside snacks, I can only imagine it was just as overpriced as everything else in this hotel. A small ice cream bar cost $5 by the pool. There were notices telling people no outside drinks or food were allowed by the pool, I guess to encourage people to spend ridiculous amounts of money on drinks and snacks. There is beach nearby and Hilton has its own boat dock there as well. You can rent a jetski for $99 PER HOUR, for example. The front desk staff were lukewarm at best. One night I found someone's lost room key card, took it to the front desk, waited almost 10 minutes in line to return it, saying I found it lying around near the pool bar. No thanks, nothing, just a very bored \"Oh yeah?\" and the woman took the card and that was that. I booked the room as a package which gave me a 50-dollar credit towards the spa services, which the front desk confirmed at check-in. Later on I had a manicure at the spa, the manicure was $45 but they add 20% gratuity automatically to each bill, and that plus tax meant my total was $63. I told the spa coordinator that I had a $50 spa credit, she called the front desk to confirm it, and then told me should couldn't deduct the credit from my bill, but the front desk would do that at check-out for me. No problem. Of course, when the bill came the day of our check-out, the spa charge was there, all $63 of it. So I had to go to the front desk to get it cleared up. I told the man they forgot to apply the $50 spa credit, expecting a sincere \"I'm so sorry\". He couldn't have been less interested. Looked into the computer, then said \"Yeah, there is a credit.\" He didn't say anything else, so I politely asked for an updated bill. He said yeah, all right, and I was still standing there and he finally realized that I wanted the correct bill, like, you know, NOW. He asked \"Do you want me to print it now?\" I said YES. He asked: \"I can just send it to you as an email.\" I said I'd prefer it printed out right then. He FINALLY did it and gave me the updated bill. This whole thing was like pulling teeth. Seriously, is it so hard to do your job? Now, there were POSITIVE aspects to the hotel resort as well. We ate at the Olive bar one evening and the food was very good and the service fast and accurate. Our room was clean and had a small balcony. There was a small fridge and a safe. The housekeeping ladies were all very friendly and our room was always nicely cleaned and tidied. The location of the Hilton resort was good, right in the Mission Bay, near the beach and a park with picnic areas and a playground. The nail tech at the spa was very nice and friendly. We had expected more from the Hilton and it speaks for itself when I say that you can getter better value for your money at the Hampton Inn (by Hilton) than a Hilton Resort.

We were meeting up with friends at the San Diego parks (Sea World, Zoo, Balboa). We wanted to be out of the city, but close to everything, and the Hilton is just that. The location was perfect. We were on the top floor of the tower, facing the bay. What a fantastic view! We even left the balcony door open the first night so we could feel the ocean breeze. The room was beautiful, very spacious, recently remodeled, and clean. I loved the wood beams that added a cool architectural element. The furnishings were dramatic--not the average boring hotel room. The beds had soft linens, feather pillows and were very comfortable. The bathroom had beautiful granite and tile, but a pretty typical bathtub/shower. Not quite ultra luxury bath like a Four Seasons, but really well done. Every hotel employee we encountered was gracious, genuine, and helpful. They each inquired about our stay and several engaged in short conversations that made it clear that they were not just \u00e2\u20ac\u0153going through the motions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but that they took pride in their job and cared about the guests. We had a very slight rattling noise from the A/C unit that most people probably wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice, and they fixed immediately. In my experience, leadership makes all the difference when it comes to the customer experience in any business, and the Hilton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s General Manager is obviously dedicated and skilled at running a major resort. We were pretty worn out from touring the parks & swimming, so we ordered room service in lieu of going to the restaurant. Room service was delicious, fast and accommodating. My son is a pretty picky vegetarian, but they were able to prepare a special dish for him! The pool was huge, gorgeous, and perfectly maintained. My son is just learning to swim and the beach-like wade in area is very cool, awesome for little ones. He also swam in the 5\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deep area with my husband and LOVED it!

I was a little skeptical based on the other reviews that I read on TripAdvisor about this propety but we were very pleased with our room and stay. It is a beautiful location overlooking Mission Bay. The sunsets were great as well as the fireworks from SeaWorld every night (at least in summer). It was a convenient location with regard to getting around San Diego, right off I-5. We got to/from the airport in less than 10 minutes; LaJolla was an easy 20 to 30 minute drive; Old Town just an exit or two away; San Diego Zoo 15 minute drive; and of course SeaWorld was 5 minutes away! You do need a car if you stay at this location and want to get around. Although the location is convenient to the highway etc., the resort is in a isolated location i.e. nothing within walking distance. However, the hotel is full service and there is a restaurant/bar (Acqua & Olive), casual pool bar/restaurant, coffee shop (Aroma), full gift shop/convenience store, spa/gym/tennis courts (which we didn't happen to use), water sports. It does have a \"beach\" technically but it's the bay. So if you are looking for a true beach experience i.e. Pacific Ocean - you'll have to head out to one of the several beaches. It does cost $25 per day to park here which we knew ahead of time but it's worth mentioning again since it seems to be a surprise to some based on the reviews. It seems to be a family-friendly place - lots of kids at the pool and lots of kids activities at the pool. They had a family movie night one night at the pool; another night S'mores on the beach. The food is very good at the Acqua restaurant - we ate there for breakfast several times, dinner, and at happy hour (Olive is the bar). However, the service is very slow so just be prepared. Nothing is quick. The pool bar also has happy hour every day which was fun and affordable I can't say how much of a value it was price-wise as we stayed using Hilton points.

At dinner they wanted to seat us outside which I said would be fine as long as we had a heater and the hostess said no problem.

It was the breakfast staff that really blew our minds. Very inefficient. Our waiter would walk all the way out to the patio and only visit one table at a time so good luck getting any drink refills or asking for the check. The hostess grumbled aloud every morning and couldn't manage a good morning or a smile. All the staff would shoulder their way through the doors and make YOU hold the doors open for them.

I was very impressed how clean and updated the resort was. As soon as we stepped foot on the property I was greeted by a friendly staff and helpful service. I instantly new we had chosen the right place for our family vacation. The front desk staff was very knowledgeable about the area and answered all questions that I had. When we arrived at our room, we were able to park directly in front of our door which was a huge plus considering parking in San Diego is hard to find. Once we were in our room we not disappointed. The room was very clean, large and it had a huge sliding glass door. When that door was all the way open, it seemed as if the entire patio and outdoors were part of the room. We had a garden view room which allowed us to watch our children play in a large grass area while my wife and I had a glass of wine on the patio. When the kids were bored with the lawn area we were only steps from the pool and the beach. With this hotel being on the bay it allowed my two boys to play in the sand and water yet not have the fear of them being tackled by large waves or the crowd of Mission Beach. The pool and restaurants are top notch. The pool is large and has an awesome relaxing atmosphere...a real oasis (plus it has a kiddie pool for the little ones). The restaurant on site has spectacular views of the bay where my family and I were able to watch wind surfers from the patio and enjoy our meal. Because the resort is on the boardwalk we had the opportunity to explore all of Mission Bay by way of walking or by bike. We actually rented a four seater bike (through the Hilton) and cruised the boardwalk for an hour. What a great way to cover lots of ground yet still be able to appreciate your surroundings. Finally, what is a San Diego trip with the family without visiting the parks? This place is is practically on Sea World's grounds it's so close, it's around the corner from the San Diego Zoo, and a few miles from Old Town and Mission Beach. Perfect location!! But to be completely honest, my family and I would have been perfectly content staying at the resort all weekend and never attempting to battle the holiday crowds.

The Indian gentleman (sorry didn't get his name) was very nice and gave both my kids a free Shamu stuff animal upon checking in. We were given room 624 (single floor villa). The room and bathroom was a nice size. The patio had 2 chaise loungers and grassy area. Kids enjoyed playing in the grassy area. This is when the trip got uncomfortable... As I was sitting in the patio watching the kids, in the corner of my eye, I saw something scurry next to my chair and then run away towards the trees. I didn't think anything of it because I thought it was a squirrel or chipmunk. The next day, I confirmed twice that indeed it was not a chipmunk but a 6-8 inch RAT!!!! I was laying on the lounger again, enjoying a cup of coffee. I happen to put my coffee cup on the ground next to me and the next thing I saw was a rat come towards the cup. Once it saw me, it ran into the tree area next door. That freaked me out pretty good so we quickly went back inside the room. As we were leaving to go out that night, we were walking along the path to our car and low and behold a RAT was sitting in the middle of the sidewalk. The rat did not even move as we approached. My wife even threw a rock at it, but it did not move. In amazement, we went to to front desk to report this to the staff. They were shocked to hear our story, and didn't believe us. So 4 members of the staff (front desk, security, bell hop) walked with us to where the RAT was and it was still sitting there. They went looking for a stick or golf club to make it move. We left them to do whatever they needed to do. I personally did not feel comfortable at the hotel after this incident. No one from the staff came to follow up with us during our stay.

I went to speak to reception at around 11am and was told that it would be cleaned up soon, but hours went by an no cleaner arrived. I went back to complain again as was greeted with 'well I am sorry you feel that way but the ducks were here long before you' and that 'you don't need to worry there is so much chlorine in the pool that you wont catch anything'. I was horrified at the terrible customer service. Eventually my partner went it to complain and was told that the cleaners had gone home and would be back at around 3pm to clean the pool. They eventually arrived at around 4pm. We went out every evening and asked for a taxi and was given the 'house' car which turned out to be 50% more expensive than a taxi. From that night we insisted on a taxi being called for us but the guy was clearly unhappy with this and once he ignored us altogether and called the 'house' car. We refused to get into it on the grounds that it was too expensive and eventually had to get a taxi number from a return journey, call it before we went out and meet it away from the hotel (they would not come to the hotel). There was however one nice gyt and on the day he was on shift he called us a taxi without any issue and didnt even call the 'house' car.

We had to wait an eternity for cribs to be delivered because \"all the housekeeping people had gone home\". Not a good start. The next morning in the restaurant, we met up with family (who luckily for them were staying elsewhere). After we were seated in the restaurant NO ONE would wait on us. We waited and waited. After asking THREE times for some help, we were told by the only server present that it was not his table, that he had asked someone to help us, and to get any service, we would need to speak to the manager! After speaking with the manager, someone finally showed up, but by then it was beyond annoying. We were gone for most of the day and got back to the room at about 4 pm. The room had not been made up. Because the twins needed a nap, we put them down with the \"Do not Disturb\" sign on the door. Right after the kids fell asleep THE PHONE RINGS - waking up the kids- and the staff person asks when they can clean our room. They had ALL DAY to clean it but wait till the evening and then ignore the \"Do not disturb\" sign. Incredible.

So before I go too far and you think this is a terrible hotel let me say we would go back. It's just that you need to temper your expectations. This is not a luxury resort. It's a very nice hotel in a good location (near Sea World and on the bay) that fits well with families with young children. There is a small kiddie pool (1 foot deep) and the main pool only gets to 5 feet deep and is 3 feet deep in most places- so our 4 year old had a great time by just avoiding the middle of the pool. It also draws a family crowd so he had plenty of kids to mess around with whenever he was poolside. Their kids camp is only offered in the summer months (another reason they are not a resort in my opinion) so that was not available, making the poolside encounters that much more important. As we experienced with HIlton in Hawaii we do wish they would put a bit more heat in their heated pools- it was not ice cold as it was in Hawaii but it could have been a bit warmer to make staying in a bit easier. They also had a great food option for those not wanting the full service restaurant: a 7-day happy hour with half price starters and drinks. It made grabbing a quick meal each evening much more affordable and was certainly good enough for us on several occasions. The issue is there is only the 1 restaurant and the bar area so leaving the property was inevitable unless you are really a creature of habit or just there for a long-weekend. Where is the hotel lacking? First, they charge $25/day for self parking. This is essentialy a suburban hotel so that struck me as way too expensive. Second, our expectation of the beach was quite different than the reality- it's not a sit out and sun yourself beach- it's a narrow strip of sand separated from the hotel by the bay-side walking/biking trail (the trail was a nice feature for getting out of the hotel). The rooms are spacious enough and in good (but not great) shape. The TV was new but the signal sketchy if you touched it. The two reading lights besides the beds didn't work at all and the chain on the lamp by the window pulled off on Night 1 (thankfully in the 'off' position). They also went a bit too far with the cheap flourescent bulb in the can light near the doorway which gave a harsh light when it was turned on (and was the only light in the room besides 2 lamps) that made us prefer to leave it off- and we were down to 1 table lamp for the whole room. They would fix things as you called- but you had to call. The shower on/off handle clearly looked like it was added on when the original one broke as it simply didn't look like it belonged there. They also have the old, what I call atomic toilets whose sound resonates for several floors - you will know when your neighbors above have gone to the bathroom and only a sound sleeper can sleep through a toilet flush in the room. So a bit more attention to detail would be nice. But the rooms are comfortable (though with the usual glut of pillows on the beds) and spacious enough. They also have two other features I wish they highlighted more clearly: refrigerators and an in-room safe. Being able to stock the small fridge was great but we were not aware it was there when booking. The safe is always nice given how much we just seem to have that has some value. The food was fine- good not great. It met our needs but we headed for other places just for variety. The larger number of CPK and other food boxes/bags suggested others felt the same way. It was nice to have poolside bar service though we found it odd in this day and age that the female servers were blonde and in short-shorts and short-sleeved shirts while the men practically had no skin showing besides their hands and faces. It's not offensive to me but it is a bit too obvious to go overlooked. So for a good hotel in a great location consider this property. It's not a value option by any means but it was a nice, comfortable base for our 7 days in San Diego. Hopefully they can smooth out some of the rough edges and it could be a really great place.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLIARS!\u201d", "Author": "Zandronovo", "ReviewID": "UR105038158", "Content": "The front desk people are liars!

Overall, there is nothing inherently wrong with the resort, but it just underwhelmed me. First, off the pictures on the website made it look as though this resort was on the ocean proper. Yeah, I guess if you look really closely and read very carefully you will be able to discern that the water in the pictures is from more of a river that is located behind the hotel. Just know---this is not the ocean. The water is dead still and the beach isn't that great. Yeah, they have boats and things to rent, but the water is pretty unimpressive, unless you have never been to a real ocean before. The Hilton is located in the middle of a large park, as well, so there are plenty of people around and the walkways are filled with people riding bikes--not very nice to walk on (good for riding bikes though). The grounds look pretty nice, so I can give that a plus. The pool seemed too small for the resort, and though it was nice, is guaranteed to be crowded, all the time. This is a pretty good area to check out some beach bodies, however. I am a Hilton Diamond VIP and though I wasn't treated poorly, I never felt as though I was being treated any different than the average Joe, despite the hundred plus nights I stay at Hilton properties yearly. This is ok for a Hampton Inn, but at a resort I feel as though this is a bit of an insult. The hotel check in time is 4pm, which is fine, but I tried to check in about 45 minutes early, and was told that the room wasn't ready and that it was a nice room and that i should wait and they will call me when it was ready. Other people were checking in and going to their rooms, so I thought \"this must be a really nice room and I am getting upgraded like I should be given my Diamond status\". I wait till 4pm and they call me to let me know my room is ready. I go to the room and it is just a regular room (#406 on 02/12/11-02/13/11)!!! No different than any other Hilton hotel in the U.S. No different than any other regular room in the hotel, except that the outside area, which are nice and have a couch/bed thing, is connected to another rooms outside area, because we are a corner room! The building we are in is shaped like an L, and our room and the room next to us are on opposing sides of the inside of the elbow. So our outside area is virtually unusable, unless you like being that close to your neighbor with no separating feature (the rest of the rooms have a wall). That was a disappointment, especially after I waited thinking I was getting an upgrade to a \"nice room\". The room wasn't bad, again standard Hilton, but wasn't \"special\", I expected more from a \"resort\" though. It was particularly noisy, however. It seemed to have a \"water running through pipes\" sound that never ceased, even at night. Anytime anyone walked by and was talking we heard the conversation loud and clear, because the front door had qaurted inch gaps on all sides between it and the jamb. Not a big deal in warm San Diego, but not a good sound dampening system. There is only one restaurant (that I found--the hotel info book is useless), which is the same as any other Hilton. We ate breakfast at the restaurant, \"Acqua\" (Diamond VIPs get free breakfast, which is nice), and it was really pretty good, so I can't complain there. You will need a car, though, if you plan on eating anything that isn't $30 a course. I wasn't charged for parking, but you are normally supposed to pay, and so I give them credit for not charging me, I guess that makes up for any other lack of VIP benefit. We also were given two bottles of water at check-in for being VIP members, so again they did give me some benefits. This hotel is nice for what it is---a hotel, but as far as being a resort, just know that it has that title predominantly because it has a spa. I probably wouldn't recommend it unless you got a great deal and you just need a place to stay,---like a regular Hilton.", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dayton, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cFantastic, very relaxing accomodations.\u201d", "Author": "traveler0000043", "ReviewID": "UR96174006", "Content": "I would highly recommend this property.

We booked two rooms at the Hilton San Diego Resort & Spa as part of a Southwest Vacation package, and we stayed from 1/1/11 to 1/6/11. Our package included two free nights per room, which turned out to be a great deal. I was completely satisfied with our room accomodations, and would highly recommend the Hilton San Diego Resort & Spa. When we checked in, our room was not quite ready, as it was early in the afternoon. The young lady at the desk asked for our cell phone number and told us they would call when our room was ready. She gave us a key we could use to look around the hotel property, then we headed for Balboa Park. When we got back at 4:00 p.m., we had not received a call, so I just assumed they forgot to call. Actually, the room still wasn't ready, so they upgraded us to a better room! We got a very spacious room on the second floor of one of the wings with a great view of the ocean. We thought it might be noisy, because I-5 is very close to the hotel, but our room was exceptionally quiet. The boys had a room on the first floor which wasn't quite as spacious as ours, but still had a great ocean view. The beds were awesomely comfortable - I slept like a baby. We had one minor maintenance issue (the bathroom door squeaked which was annoying when we had to get up at night), but that was quickly resolved when I told the folks at the front desk. The property was lovely. Even though it was unseasonably cold in San Diego, the boys used the pool (which was heated nicely, according to them) and the hot tub, which they really enjoyed. I used the fitness center, which was nicely appointed with treadmills & ellipticals and weight equipment. I struck up a conversation with a local woman who was on another elliptical, and she told me that she had a membership to the fitness center there. It is pretty upscale. It even had a changing room with a sauna, lockers with digital locks and showers. There were plenty of towels. We did not eat at the hotel, but I did get coffee and danish at the coffee shop by the registration area. I waited in line for about 15-20 minutes to get my breakfast items - that was the only thing I would say could have been improved. There was only one gentleman working behind the counter, and although he was friendly, he seemed a bit overwhelmed. There was a steady stream of people waiting. There was a $25/day fee for parking, but since I knew about it and was expecting it, there was no surprise. Because the hotel was right by I-5, we were able to easily access all parts of the city with our rental car, so we explored from Coronado and points south to Torrey Pines State Reserve to Temeculah and the wine country north of San Diego. We had a wonderful trip to San Diego, and the hotel stay was part of it. I would certainly stay there again, and I would also go back to San Diego.

Bathroom are the worst, mold/grime is clearly visible on the caulking and ceiling; the need to be gutted. Upon room review, make sure to check the bathroom first and immediately request a different room at the first sign of disrepair! (2) Parking is ridiculous at $25 a night.

Hilton take note, Disneyland charges $15 dollars a day and they have FULL security with cameras, come on, get with it. Stop gouging us!!!! Had to budget around this cost all week, dissapointing! (3) Restaurant albeit good, WAY too expensive. NOTE: if parking were less, perhaps it could be justified. (4) Extra cost for the exercise room, nonsense for a supposed 4(four) star hotel this should be included. (5) Bay is not that pretty at all; very murky resembles more of a retention pond.

Four(4) star hotels are concerned with their guests comfort.....didn't seem like they were interested.

They even ripped us off there too as one evening we tried to get a taxi and they told us to take a people carrier van of theirs instead as 'ot costs the same as a taxi' the van cost $20, the same return journey in a taxi cost $13. Also they charge $30 a night to park in their carpark. Again it's a disgusting attempt at extortion. The car park is large and spaces are not in great demand.

I am a seasoned traveler and I know the difference between BAYVIEW and BAYFRONT. Apparently the people at Hilton do not know the difference. My room was room 310 in the villas. It was on the side of the building, not the front. The so called bayfront view was blocked by a three foot cement wall so you really couldn't see the bay. The room (310) was a disgrace. Wallpaper peeling the bathroom, toggle on switch missing, lamp not working, tv reception crappy, floors dirty, sprinkler in hallway outside the room leaking, dark rooms. What a dive! They should be ashamed flattering themselves by giving a 4 star rating. I don't like being lied to and deceived into trying to convince me that room 310 is a BAYFRONT room and tried to charge me accordingly. The room is a BAYVIEW.

The are surrounding the base was less than desired and because my husband had just gotten off work when we left for the airport he needed a nap. I decided to bid on priceline for a 4* last minute and was given the lovely Hilton Resort and Spa for only $10 more than what we were paying at the base. I was a little worried as the reviews are mixed. I would definitely give this hotel a 3.5*/4* for its wonderful amenities. We were given a villa in the Remo area which was on the ground floor and had a patio and a HUGE lawn area that our son could burn off steam. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to do this as the beach was right there and he rather spend his time playing in the sand. The beach looked like it was racked every morning and there was a pathway that went up and down the beach and many people used for running. The pools were wonderful too. There was a kiddie pool and bigger pool with a zero entry. There was a also a spa, with a wonderful view of the beach. Some areas of the hotel could have used a better cleaning (i.e. the waterfall and pools and wine glasses sat by room for 2 days), but they were not that bad. The room was an average room, with a refrig. The room had some areas that were worn as the other reviewers had stated, but I found them good enough. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was updated with granite countertops. We were not in the room that much as we utilized the beach a lot. We used the refrig to store milk and drinks for breakfast. The front desk attendant also mentioned that if we needed a microwave that we could rent one for $20 a day or I could just ask the restaurant to heat up my sons toddler meals. There was free wifi in the courtyard area and happy hour from the bar is everyday from 5-7pm. They will even give you a drink in a plastic cup so you could sit outside by the pool. The parking was the only outrageous thing at the resort ($25 a day) and to be honest we are not even sure they went around to look for the ticket hanging in the window. I had left it off most of the time and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have one problem. All and all, I would highly recommend this resort for anyone with little ones (our son is 2 1/2), looking for a hotel on the beach (although I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t swim in the water-too cold), a wonderful pool area, especially with the zero entry and a kiddie pool.

It has been a few years since i was last here and i was glad to see the growth. When I lived in Vegas, we had brought family and friends down on a couple of occasions. Now that i live in Carlsbad, I still bring the family down there for an escape from NC. There is now a bar (on the boardwalk) and an expanded recreational rentals store front on the water. Our room was fresh and clean. The refurbished decorations were comfortable and sophisticated and solid. Not sure how long ago these changes were made, but definitely nice. The beds were comfortable and the pillows were great. Nice large flat screen TV. $11.95 for the internet. We went and rode our bikes along the great bike / walking path. Had a great relaxing time. We ate at Aqua and sat outside in the teardrop pods. We had the prosciutto and goat cheese appetizers. The ham selections were delicious (Italian Parma; duck; & Austrian) - serviced with slices of Parmesan, pickles and olives (the pickles weren't that great). The goat cheese wasn't as good as i had hoped but the fig confit helped make it tasty. The only two complaints were 1) (and this is more because of the HHonors program) the price for parking is now $25 per night. If it were a downtown location were parking was at a premium, i could swallow it better. I talked to the MOD (Nick) and lodged my complaint and there was little he was willing to listen to. I work in the resort business so, I definitely understand his stance but that didn't cure the bad taste in my mouth about it. Regarding the HHonors, i would have hoped after being a loyal HHonors member for 20 years, that there would be some perk for my loyalty. I didn't even get offered a room upgrade and i know the hotel wasn't 100% filled up. 2) the second complaint is that we stayed at the far south end of the property in room 501. In that room, we were right next to the property facilities (assume laundry and maintenance). At about 10pm, we started to hear sounds from a party going on. As i looked outside, i discovered that the party was actually coming from the hotel facilities. I didn't mind the noise so much (although it was pretty loud) and i had fallen asleep with the door open. At about 2:30 am, the party was still going on.

It has a small fire pit, comfortable seating, a wonderful Jacuzzi, and large eucalyptus trees which create a relaxing environment. (See photo.) I was a little concerned about soaking in a public Jacuzzi, but my friend assured me that it was well-maintained and would be fine. I soaked Friday afternoon, then again Sunday morning before checking out. Sunday morning, after having been in the Jacuzzi for about 30 minutes, I got out, dried off, and when I went to put my towel in the basket, I found one used condom and two condom wrappers in the bushes adjacent to the Jacuzzi I had just soaked myself in. DISGUSTING! (Was the other used condom floating around in the water with me?!) I told the front desk supervisor, William, about my experience and how disgusted I was. He offered no apology and would not compensate me in any way. It was 11:30, and check-out time was at noon. I asked him if I could have a little extra time to take a longer shower in my room. He told me I had until noon to shower, pack and be out of the room. I went back to my room, literally nauseated by the thought of having soaked my body in that water. I showered as quickly as possible, though I wanted to stay in the shower much longer in order to get all of the umm...bodily fluids off of me. I called William at the front desk at 11:50 and asked him if I could have an extra 15 minutes. \"That will be a problem. We have another guest checking in and need to clean the room.\" (Check-in time is at 4:00.) I reminded him that I was the lady who had just soaked in someone's ___. He grudgingly gave me until 12:30, after which time, he assured me, I would be charged an additional $75.00. (I wasn't asking for a lot of time; a mere extra 15 minutes to get the other person's bodily fluids sufficiently washed off.) Anyway, I went down at 12:10 and spoke with William's boss, Josh. He was much friendlier. He apologized for the condoms and for William's behavior and assured me the used condom would be picked up and William would be spoken to. I'm genuinely saddened that this happened. Before this ordeal, I was really enjoying my stay, the staff and the grounds. William's behavior was completely unacceptable. He should have at least apologized, if not offered me an extra 30 minutes to shower without me having to beg for it.

However, we stayed in the two storey rooms on the corridors overlooking the gardens and the corridors were quite shockingly tired, the corridor we walked through to get the hotel (100's I think) was very smelly, rather like a sewer and reminded me of a youth hostel - definitely not 4 star, more like 2. Had we stayed on that particular corridor I would definitely have asked to be moved. The rooms themselves were nice, but so dark and very damp. The beds however were very comfortable and the housekeeping was good. The bathroom was tiny for an upgraded lanai garden room. Overall, a nice stay but we felt a little ripped off, the $25 daily parking charge is not really justifiable at all and is offputting when reflecting on your stay.

The walls are a bit thinner than you'd expect from a hotel of this class, however. The overall feel of the resort is good, with lots of open areas and seating. The pool area is nice but becomes a bit crowded during the day, but the beach is just a few steps away so it's easy to find a spot. It's along Mission Bay which has a great walking trail. As for location, it's great for what it is. You're not in the middle of everything but Mission Bay is beautiful and offers lots to do. If you're looking for nightlife or shopping you'd be better served to look elsewhere. We have 2 small children and they had a great time at the pool and at the beach, and unlike at some other properties we did not feel uncomfortable having our children with us. That said, the service leaves something to be desired. There were a number of little issues that left us feeling like this is a 3 star service hotel, not a 4. A few examples: some of the restaurant service was quite slow, although the waitstaff was uniformly friendly. Also, the bathrooms in the restaurant were not well maintained. Of 3 sinks, 2 did not have any soap in the dispensers, and my wife informed me that the waste baskets in the women's restrooms were overflowing (and not during a particularly busy time). The food was very good to occasionally exceptional, however, though quite expensive. As for other staff, they were mostly helpful with an occasional exception. For example, a linen cart deliveryman was at the the elevators and occupied the 1st to arrive without offering it to waiting guests. It was not like there was an endless stream of people waiting, either. It's things like this that can make people paying premium rates feel less than valued as customers. If the resort were to fix these small but quite important details it could, given its location and otherwise good offerings, be considered a true 4 star resort. And of course, no review would be complete without a complaint about the ridiculous charges assessed by most hotels in this class. No free Internet in the rooms? $25 to park when this is not a downtown location? These things leave one feeling as if Hilton is picking one's pockets. Coupled with the overall level of service, I would have to say this is a 3 star, not a 4. Good, but not great.

However, once I booked it, I had a feeling this wasn't going to go well before we even got there. The hotel didn't return my calls for starters, then we got there and were given a single King when I had requested a double Queen. They brought a rollaway instead - after we waited quite a while for it. (Granted, I did get a call from the front desk asking if it had been delivered yet, which it hadn't). They didn't even bring it IN the room; they knocked and presented it to us (I was traveling with a friend), and WE had to roll it into the room, move furniture around so it would fit, and set it up, which then made a desk and chair unusable because it was too tight. When we checked in, I asked for a manager to call me in the room to discuss the parking situation. They charge $25/day for parking (ridiculous, given they have plenty of room for guest parking). I am disabled and have a disabled parking permit. I wanted them to reduce or waive the parking fee. The manager never called me. I ended up with a \"supervisor\" being brought out to speak with me as I checked OUT (not a manager). He did halve the parking fee and said \"next time\" I stayed there, they would be sure to \"take care of me\" - shouldn't they be \"taking care of me\" from the moment I make the reservation?!? I even told him we were not done with our vacation but were so disappointed by the room and service that we had decided to stay our prepaid 3 nights because I couldn't get a refund, but that we were going to stay at another hotel for the 4th night. That was an opportunity for him to comp a room for our last night, but he didn't make that choice. My travel buddy had breakfast there one morning: $22 for a measly meal. And I had martinis at the bar one night - $14 each! Crazy! Even the bartender recommended not ordering certain desserts because they were \"the size of a MINI Reese's peanut butter cup\". MINI, mind you. Peace and quiet? Only rarely - on the one hand, seeing the SeaWorld fireworks every night might have been fun, but they didn't even mention it on check-in, so we were startled every night by the booming noises from across the bay and didn't get out in time to see the whole show. Not to mention the \"young adults\" who were running around our small building of units, outside our door, and knocking plates and glasses over on the room service tray we had set outside by our door. Oh, don't forget: there is a fee for EVERYthing. Parking, wi-fi, gym access, etc. A total ripoff. The room was dated, very dark. There was a floor lamp that I couldn't figure out how to turn on; ends up it has a foot switch, but it was so dark on the floor in the corner where it sits that I couldn't see it. Why didn't someone come and orient us to the room? We did have \"Doug,\" a kind of shabby but nice older man unload the bags from our car but that was it. There was also mildew all over the shower curtain. The positives? The king bed was comfy, the linens clean, the towels big and thick, and the big oval, cushioned lounge chair on the patio was very comfy to lay on when outside.

You get the sense that the owners know their location is great for families and they do just enough upkeep to keep people interested in staying there. There are definitely pluses: the beds are very comfortable, staff tries to be accommodating, and it has a pool, spa and conference center. Plenty of hot water and good water pressure, in room safe and refrigerator were all pleasant surprises. Great access to I-5, Sea World, downtown and coastal beach towns. The property sits right on the beach with a large (cement) \"boardwalk\" walking/biking path running alongside the bay. If you like taking a walk/riding a bike on a scenic path right outside your door this is perfect. Mission Bay is beautiful and very peaceful on winter weekdays. The pool looked very nice, and the conference center seemed to be in better shape than the rest of the facility. Free wifi connection was sporadically available in that lobby and in the registration area. The minuses are significant. First, as others have noted the buildings are older, rooms and halls are dark. Several rooms had a musty/mildewy odor as did the halls. Our building's outside door locks didn't lock at night so it didn't feel very secure knowing anyone could walk into the building at night from the nearby parks or walking paths. The recent renovations in the rooms are attractive but we tried several rooms due to musty odor, malfunctioning phone/TV, or absurdly poor location of the parking lots right up to the first floor patio door. There's a huge tent sitting in the parking lot which is used for special events. If you are in the tower building on the first floor be prepared for the intrusion of car lights shining right into your room. The 2 story villa buildings have no elevators so they assume everyone is ok hauling your bags to the 2nd floor room or being in the tower. The worst is indeed the noise. The doors must be hollow since we couldn't escape any hallway noises of housekeeping carts and personnel shouting to one another in Spanish or the heavy footsteps above our room which awakened us each morning. The bathrooms were renovated but the paint is chipping, and there's a panel over the tub area that is reminiscent of a 1970's era apartment. The halls and rooms are dark, and they only illuminate the ceiling hall lights and not the wall sconces, despite the unappealing dark appearance. The front desk staff are impresseive since they appear to be doing everything. The Hilton charges $25 a night for parking, plus $12 a day room (ethernet) internet connection. There is no concierge on duty for this \"resort\" ; which even 3* hotels frequently have, so to call this a resort seems outrageous for what you are getting. Overall, it is challenging to stay here, but the accessibility of the parks and paths, location right on the bayfront, hard-working front desk staff personnel, and general location made it a better experience. If you have patience and a patient front desk staff it has the potential of being a good vacation spot.", "Date": "March 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWe had fun and relaxed\u201d", "Author": "SoCalGringo", "ReviewID": "UR56102150", "Content": "I think this place flies a bit under the radar due to the $25 parking fee.

We picked the resort because it seemed like a good place for families. The pool is nice, the grounds beautiful and the park awaiting your workout. We utilized the hotel's dock renting a paddle boat and also a bike with training wheels for my son. My son met some kids from another country and was playing with them in the pool. The tennis courts looked nice although we didn't play this time. There are no court fees. We spent most of our time around the pool, in the hot tubs, and exercising around the hotel.

The breakfast brunch offered a decent number and variety of dishes, most of them very tasty. My only complaint: There were a lot of flies buzzing around the food because of the many open patio doors in the restaurant. I also took issue with the resort charging $25 per night for parking (which is pretty scarce in the evenings on weekends).

The original room we were given (garden view villa) had a terrible smell (dog or mildew) so we were given another similar room free from any offensive smells. The reason we couldn't stay another night is because the walls were so paper thin that next door we heard a newborn baby crying every hour the entire night. It was as if the baby was in a crib wailing in our own room. It truly felt as if we were sharing rooms! Maybe it was just our run of bad luck with the room situation, but I don't think it's convenient for anyone (including those with young children) to play musical rooms. The front desk hotel staff was surprisingly hostile when I innocently \"reminded\" them we had free parking included in our hotel package. Apparently I spoke too soon because the attendant said she was \"getting to that!\" I was also a little stunned that 2 of the front desk women wore Pro Union buttons as part of their uniform. I thought it was pretty offensive and shocked that Hilton would allow that. On a very positive note, we spent some time at the pool area and they had a great kids pool-very separate from the big pool, so i didn't feel as if the young single couples lounging were disrupted.

The primary problems with the hotel, although there are a good number of them, seem to pale in comparison to the bad service rendered at the hotel. I guess the best way to look at it if you're considering a stay is this: Why is a waterfront hotel and resort run by the Hilton company with TONS of amenities in a great location rated SO LOW in Tripadvisor ratings for the city?!?!?! Think about it. First off, some of the positives: -Nice bay location that's up against a nice city park with a great jogging path and lots of room to play and relax, whether it's water or land you wish to play on. -Good coffee and lighting in rooms, and having a mini-fridge is always a nice touch. -Pool area is nice and complete with lush landscaping, bar service, hot tubs, plush towels, security, and firepits that make for a really nice area. -Good, comfortable beds and quality air conditioning that truly works! Now, a dose of reality about this hotel that makes you feel it's all facade, and no heart. -Poor housekeeping. My room featured a kleenex and an India Palace or some such restaurant's receipt UNDER MY PILLOW! -While rooms have nice furnishings, they seem to be getting old and a bit worn down around the edges. My room featured some chips on the wall, a shower curtain coming off the rod, an inconsistently flushing toilet, and a remote control for the tv that only had part of the buttons working. -OUTRAGEOUS prices in the snack shop! Let's just put it this way,...THREE DOLLARS for a 12-ounce container of milk. -Overpriced parking for $22 per night when it's nowhere near downtown and is set next door to a park with HUNDREDS of free spots. MONEY GRAB!! Also features an overpriced restaurant, overpriced bar, and overpriced internet for your overpriced web-surfing pleasure. Lastly, and most important of all, this place simply has disgustingly poor service, particularly at the front desk. I checked in with a supervisor and had some questions about my benefits as a frequent stay member. Because he was unable to satisfactorily answer my questions, he suggested we call the main answer line for Hilton. After several minutes of holding, a lady came on the other end, and after hearing my questions and concerns offered a statement I'll never forget,....\"Sir, we appreciate your loyalty to Hilton and would like to offer you and your family a weekend to look at one of our Hilton Grand Vacations destinations!!!\" NO JOKE,she was trying to sell a customer with a question and a complaint a TIMESHARE CONDO!! My question was never answered, the guy at the desk kept shaking his head and smirking, and they had a customer whose stay had been ruined before it began.

If that more or less fits your travel profile, there is nothing not to love about this place. It is \"isolated\" if you don't have a car, but it is 10 minutes to every beach in SD if you do. There is a beautiful park next door, and biking/running/walking trails right out your front door, along with bike and water-sport rentals. The staff was excellent in all regards. We did have a problem when we tried to check in early and were assured they would put a rush on having our room cleaned so we could check in. By 4:00 they still did not have our room ready so they upgraded us to a Garden Front Villa which was tastefully furnished and very comfortable. The towels were fine - don't know what to say about \"sharp edges\" review. And, yes - it costs $22 to park your car but I am from Seattle and this is common there, too. Being from rainy Seattle I have a thing for palm trees, and the beautifully landscaped grounds at the Hilton feature many. For only a 2 1/2 hour flight, I felt I had left the states for a tropical paradise when I arrived at the Hilton Mission Bay.

Location: On Mission Bay across from SeaWorld. Watch SeaWorld's fireworks each night while you relax at the pool. Bad: Cost - You will be charged for EVERYTHING. Need to get on the internet from your room? There is a charge! Want to go to the Gym? There is a charge! Kids participate in the kid's program? There is a charge! Want to utilize one of the hotel's bikes? There is a charge! Want to make Smore's (which are highlighted in the hotel's advertisements)? There is a charge! Coffee Bar - This is not Starbucks; but they sell Starbucks coffee. Plan to stand in line for a long time to get your morning latte. Be careful, there is a female staff member that will not be only rude but will talk about you when you leave (yep she gave me her full opinion on a previous customer's outfit). Coffee Bar also closes early; so if you need a jolt after 1pm you are out of luck! Gratuity - Watch out! Gratuity at the restaurant and bar are normally automatically included in small print line item. However in bigger letters the bill ask you to write in a Gratuity amount; yep they want gratuity 2xs! Take a moment and review your bill at the restaurant and bar - there is a good chance you will find the gratuity already included. Party - Weekends are a BIG party time for local college kids to come to San Diego and party. Good chance you will wake up to some loud kids having a good time. Isolated - This hotel is on 17 acres with only 1 restaurant. Too far to walk to another restaurant. So if you don't have a car and don't want to pay too much for taxis; then you will need to eat at the resort. Breakfast is around $15 per person; Dinner is around $25 per person. Concierge - Nice group but are not too knowledgeable on local attraction costs and hotel policies. Activity brochures are hidden around the corner from the Concierge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desk. Worth looking for the brochures and doing your own research. If you are a AAA member; call AAA directly to get their pricing for tickets to local attractions; they are normally less then what you can get from the concierge - yet the conceirge will always state they are less. Priceline - If you received your room thru Priceline (minimum bid is $80/night) then you will get the lower rooms in the tower. These rooms are fine; however your view will be of the parking lot. You can pay to have your room upgraded. Internet - In room cost money. Wireless in the comman area (by pool or lobby) is spotty. Rooms - Are dated and may have broken items (door handles, lamps). More of a 3 Star then a 4 Star; but it was not dirty and house keeping did a good job on keeping it looking nice. Transportation - While this hotel is on 17 acres; they still charge a huge parking fee - $25/night. Since it is out of the way; taxis charge a premium for usage.

If you're looking for a nice romantic weekend with the one you love look elsewhere to spend it as you will be completely disappointed. Our room faced out toward the \"bay\" which was actually more like a swamp without trees. Its located on a public park with a bike path nearly 15 feet from your sliding glass door with constant people walking, running, biking and/or skateboarding from sun up until about 11 pm at night. Their noise can easily be heard even with the sliding glass door shut and no windows open. The furnishings in the room are all mismatched and look like they were picked up the day before at a consignment store and thrown in to make it a \"room\" including hanging wires to the tv and internet connection (of course you have to pay to use the WiFi) visible and dangling there under the table they set the tv on. There was not even a coffee maker even though in their description it states there is one. We ordered room service which came after 45 minutes (it was a pizza and chicken sandwich, yes seriously 45 minutes later) and both were cold and almost inedible had it not been for our hunger.

A few glitches that i would be aware of: During our late December 2008 stay the \"pizza oven\" was broken and apparently had been for a month. It would have been nice if an insert was in the room service menus explaining this if it really was a long term problem.. There are 4 pizzas mentioned on the menu.

Location is a negative issue as well - there is nothing at all around there; it is in the midst of a large city park, separated from neighborhoods by the 8 lane freeway. If you expect ocean views, forget it. If you expect expansive beaches, forget it. Little kids - the 5 yr old set - will enjoy playing in the sand. Lots of good grounds for kids to run in as well. Parking is an absurd $25 and there is no overnight parking in the surrounding park / street.

Pool is also nice (watch out for the duck poop . . . ducks hang out in the pool early morning and poop in it - just ask for it to be cleaned). We had a 2 hour protest which was annoying. Rooms are spacious, but not luxurious. The \"lanai\" is a balcony is you are on the second floor, so don't expect much more. The lanais and fire pits on the first floor are great. The cabanas at the pool are $75 dollars for the day during the week, 120 and 150 for c9 on the weekends.

I called directly to try to get 3 rooms close by with extended patio that the cousins might be able to play on and visit other rooms/hang out easily. Told agent that it was important to me and was willing to pay more for a room for my request. With taxes, the rooms were about $400 a night each.

I don't know why they charge $22 a night to park when it doesn't seem like they enforce parking.

But rentals were a bit pricey and bicycle selection was limited and condition was not great (squeaky chain, worn handgrips). The 2 Queen room was unusually spacious, as was the bathroom. It had a nice sliding door that opened out onto the path along the bay. I could even see the fireworks from Sea World each evening from the patio outside my room. However, the tub was either in need of re-surfacing or poorly done, as the bottom had an unappealing two-tone look where the top coating had worn through.

I agree that it's a secluded location, so if you just want to get away from it all, or have a meeting where you just want to walk around a bit during the day, it would work, and if you had a car it could even serve as a reasonable base for San Diego attractions.

It's loaded with families and kids... so it was good for us as a family. We were in the main hotel facing the freeway. The Good: - Gorgeous setting on Mission bay. - It's only a few minutes from Seaworld. - Lots to do on the sight. - Nice pool area. - Employees were all very friendly. - Plenty of parking spaces by the main hotel. - Larger than average rooms with big balcony. - Nice bath soaps/shampoos. - Bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows. The Bad: - Parking $22/night (way too much for the area... downtown you'd expect this... in the area it is in the parking should be free; or at least no more than $10/night). - While we didn't notice outside noise, we could here EVERYTHING going on inside the hotel. Every step that was taken in the room above us, every time a door would open/close in the hallway, every time someone would open their sliding closet door or even flush their toilet we could hear it... loud and clear. - While the hotel is maintained well, it could use some updating (especially in the rooms... the tile and most of the fixtures in the bath area appear to be many decades old... and there was a bad patch job done above the shower head (like the room above must have leaked onto our ceiling and rotted it at one point)). - The TV was old and the picture slightly distorted. Most 4* (and even quite a few 3*) hotels have already upgraded to large flat-panel TV's... at this level of property I would kind-of expect them to keep up. - Took housekeeping 3 calls and 5 hours to bring us a roll-away bed... albeit the front desk was very friendly and apologetic. Conclusion: If they would update and soundproof the rooms and cut the parking fees I'd give this place the top 5 out of 5 rating it is certainly capable of. We had just a few too many problems to rank it much higher than we did (I would have given it a 3.5 out of 5 if that were an option).

Bring your running shoes. They serve Starbucks coffee in the lobby, but not just coffee as you would normally see. They have almost all the drinks that a regular Starbucks would have. Our only complaint is that they charge for internet and parking. We had our own internet connection, so didn't need to use theirs, but they should offer free wireless. The gym also charges $12/day, but if you sign up for H Honors on their site, you'll get the gym access for free and it costs nothing to sign up.

If you have ever stayed at there propert Paradis Point in San Diego, you know what a dive the Hilton Resort is resorting too. We had booked our stay in our usual room on the bay. A king room with lanai with a fire pit. Great location, however they recently renovated the rooms and removed the ceiling fans in all there rooms. With an energy crunch, who does this. We no longer could enjoy the cool breeze with our fan as we had done in the past. Instead we had to run the air conditioner. What a waste. When they renovated, they put in some funky type wicker furniture that is not comfortable. The patio furniture is just as uncomfortable. When you are paying 480+ a night you expect better. The stay started out with the staff just completely rude. The young man checking me in was quite unpleasant, wanted to know who had made my reservation for me as they had not done it correctly. Like this is my problem. He did not greet me with Welcome back, Mrs. Smith like they had done in the past. Then the bellman. What a joke. He piled everything up on the cart and knocked over our 200 dollar radio and the speaker cover broke off. He never replied with sorry, he just wanted to know if we had any more stuff. He was rude and obviously did not want to be there. Our second day was suppose to be a relaxing one by the pool. However, someones small child pooped in the pool. My 4 year old is not terrified of swimming in there pool in fear of seeing poop in it again. As it floated right past her. They solution to this was bus everyone to Paradise Point. This wasn't quite working for us. So we swam in the polluted bay along with most people. You would have thought they might offer to bring out some lawn chairs for us. No such luck. I believe the facility has fired all there long time employees who are union. As they were picketing at the hotel during memorial day weekend. I wouldn't waste your money at this place.

The pool is 1 ft and is perfect for little swimmers. Didn't have to worry about the older kids splashing and horsing around too close to the little kids. The Banana Cabana offers a full bar and grill as well as snacks and drinks for kids. A little over priced but what resort isn't?? We ate dinner at the Bayside Grille and had one of the finest dinners we've ever had. True fine dining. Don't expect fast food when eating at a 4star restaurant. Good quality food takes time but is well worth the wait. Everything was cooked to perfection and beautifully presented. I highly recommend the mushroom crusted halibut! We didn't eat there for breakfast or lunch so I can't tell you if the service is faster at those times but I can only assume so since they never had a wait time. Expect prices to reflect the qualtiy of the food. If you want fast, cheap food try Dennys. I've often said that bad travelers write bad reviews. People who treat other people badly will in turn be treated badly themselves. A little kindness goes a long way and a simple thank you every once in a while tends to get better service than behaving like a horses rear-end.

When we checked in and went to our room, we got a huge surprise upon opening the door. Of course it was probably a bigger surprise for the people who had arrived at the room five minutes before us and were already camped out on the beds. One would think that the front desk would respond diligently to such a problem of double booking, but after a curt \"we'll do what we can\" reply on the phone, the other family called with a little more fervor. After twenty minutes, someone arrived to give the other family key cards to their new room. They didn't help them move, didn't apologize, and didn't offer to tidy up our soiled room. They did manage to deactivate our room keys though. When we went to the front desk for new keys, the lady proceded to give us a lecture on proper key usage like we were kids. While the location is beautiful and San Diego is a magic place for our family, this stay ends a six-year routine we have kept. Something changed drastically in the way the property is managed. The hallway smelled of mildew like we never smelled before. The staff attitude was indifferent and rude, when it used to be very friendly. The kicker is that two months after the fact, I got a form letter from the property manager saying something along the lines of \"we appreciate your feedback and will consider your input\" or something like that. When I emailed back to say \"don't bother,\" it was clear she had no clue what the problem we encountered was. I got a form response about \"improvement and change\" with all sorts of corporate buzzwords like \"synergy\" and \"teamwork.\" It thoroughly explained why we had the experience we had. No one in management listens. The vibe from the staff was one of indifference and being there solely to collect a paycheck. While the property is beautiful (despite the sometimes polluted bay), it is not worth the huge prices they want. To top it off, parking is extremely difficult, because with a full hotel, packed conference rooms, and sections of the parking lot closed off for their storage and events, there are not enough spaces. It was sort of ironic to pay for parking and end up on the street a couple of times. Granted, we always had a space at night.

Checkin was quick and easy. (Be forewarned if you use Debit to backup your account, they will put a hold on your account for $100 for EACH day of your stay!) The Room: Our room was 377. The hallway had that funky smell that has been mentioned in other reviews. Smelled like fresh paint to me. It was noticable but not too bothersome; I could not smell it in the actual room. My first impression of the room was \"WOW\". It was very contemporary - not my style, but very nice nonetheless. Also liked the balcony area. Beds were very comfy. The NOISE: This is where the WORST part comes in. I have never stayed in a hotel where the noise was almost unbearable. Light sleepers beware! The noise tended to peak at the 11:30 pm timeframe - about when the Sea World folks were returning and then start up again around 7 or 8 am. You can easily hear footsteps, voices, doors, and of course the unique toilet flushing sound. Sometimes it sounded as if it was several floors above. It was quite obnoxious! I'd managed to wear my 3 yr old out every day of our stay, so luckily SHE slept through it all. Restaurant: We ate breakfast at the terrace restaurant every morning. It was consistently good. I ordered from the menu two days and did the buffet one. Both were good. The buffet had a little of everything and then some. $22-24 for one adult and a child (includes tip) wasn't great, but it was convenient and tasty. The service was excellent.

The room we stayed in was quite large with two queen beds. Apparently they upgraded us from the normal garden view room to one that was 25% bigger. If you can afford the extra few dollars get this bigger room rather than the cheaper smaller ones. The smaller rooms had their patios right outside their front doors on commonly used walkways rather than on the oppossite end of the room the way ours was. While we could see other people from our location we at least didn't have to worry about people tripping over our feet while they walked by. The room was updated with new carpeting, bedding etc... Beds were comfortable but not as nice as some I've stayed on. The bathroom was loud, you could even hear when neighbors took showers, but had nice towels. The pool and grounds around it were above average, even better than I had hoped based on the rest of the exterior condition of the hotel. There were lots of kids on the weekend however so I wouldn't recommend for someone looking for a quiet get away. The weekdays we were there were very quiet. Some rooms have fire pits outside. I personally did not like this as I don't want to smell smoke when I'm sleeping. We had a family move in below us who liked a good fire so that prevented us from leaving the sliding glass door open in the evenings. The beach that is right outside of the hotel is really nothing special at all compared to the other excellent San Diego area beaches we visited. Still it gave our 3 year old a chance to play in the sand which is all she really cared about. We had lunch and dinner at the hotel multiple times. It is very expensive but was of a high enough quality that we weren't dissapointed. One tip. Ask for the lunch menu if nothing on the dinner menu looks appealing. I could only have steak so many times and discovered that they'll server lunch during the dinner hour. The turkey wrap I ordered while still expensive was excellent. I'm giving the hotel 4 stars simply because I enjoyed myself. For that reason alone I believe it deserves more than 3.

I mentioned how glad we were to be at the hotel to the clerk and how horrible a drive we'd had. I didn't expect much of a room because I booked using Hilton Honors points. In fact, we were only able to book a king bed room (we wanted 2 beds) and request the 2 beds. The clerk then told me that she was giving us a room with 2 queens that was 25% larger than their regular rooms. To make things even better, the room she gave us had a bay view. Our room was very clean and definitely renovated. It was in one of the garden wings (not the tower) near the bay. It was very contemporary in style (if previous posters did not have a contemporary room, they may not have had the renovated room that they thought they had). There was an additional area where the bar was, that was down a few steps. It had bamboo or bamboo like flooring. The kids wound up playing down there (it was the area that made the room 25% larger) and we nicknamed it the playroom. We were so tired that we ate dinner at the hotel restaurant. I usually prefer to dine off premises because hotel restaurants are typically not worth the money in places like San Diego where there are so many good restaurants. While it wasn't cheap, it was quite good. The creme brulee for dessert was perhaps the best we've eaten in years and was large for the price. The pool area was large and attractive. However, the water was 12 feet deep in parts. That makes me nervous with my kids swimming. Definitely one of those pools where we joined them a lot and watched them like hawks when we weren't in the pool with them. My only complaint with the hotel (which will be an odd complaint because this seems to be the one thing that other people consistently like) is the hotel's location on Mission Bay. Mission Bay really has at least two different parts to it. The part that the Hilton is on, is the least attractive of the two. It looks more like an estuary than a bay. I didn't really get that great I'm on the water feel that some of the other Mission Bay hotels give me.

Well maintained landscaping connects the buildings and at its core is a main lobby with restaurant and pool. Parking is limited to one side of the hotel, and all the rooms seem to face towards the beach or landscaping on other side, so once you leave your car, you feel like you're really in a resort. Our room was not a suite and yet spacious with its private balcony and cathedral ceiling. The hotel is right on the beach of Mission Bay, so it's an easy walk from even the furthest room. On either side of the hotel are public parks, so you can walk on paved sidewalks for about a quarter mile in each direction, take the kids to a nearby playground, or enjoy a picnic on the grass. Some downsides are that the hotel is close to the interstate highway, so the sound of the traffic is omnipresent if you're outdoors. The beach, unfortunately, is on an inner bay, so no waves--just still water like being on a quiet lake. Great for kids, though, who won't be struggling with waves or an undertow at the ocean. During our stay, however, the water was contaminated and you weren't able to go in for a swim or ride a boat. The biggest disappointment was a $20 charge to park the car--not for valet, but for self-parking in an open parking lot--a ridiculous price considering the high cost of the hotel and a poor welcome to a resort. Hilton should reconsider this. The Hilton San Diego Resort advertises itself as a resort, but it's definitely a mixed bag. Any problems associated with its location on the water or by the freeway can't be easily be overcome by the hotel, but it should certainly warn its guests, especially if they can't take advantage of all its amenities or expect a romantic secluded spot on the ocean.

Part of it was due to inexperience and lack of training, part of it was due to the unfriendly demeanor of a few employees. Having said that, it may be that the staff's attitude is a defensive response to the boorish behavior of some of the guests particularly at the check-in desk. I agree with previous comments that your experience at this property will be greatly enhanced by your room assignment and that seemed to be a problem with quite a few people during our stay. If you're paying Priceline prices it's not so bad, but if you're paying rack rates it can be a big disappointment. Ask to see a map of the resort when you're checking in and ask questions about the location of your room in relation to parking lots, freeway, etc. Once you get past the room issue the resort can be enjoyable. The grounds are nicely kept and the pool area is pleasant. But, as other Trip Advisors have noted, it does not have the ambiance of other four-star resorts.

The grounds are nice, well kept, expansive banquet facilities with weddings, 'proms' and business functions going on, a full building dedicated as a spa, great pool featuring 'banana cabana', resturant right on the bay, guest access direct to sandy beach where there's sailboat and jetski rental. Now for the bad - THE ROOMS. We were checked into a room on the bottom floor located as soon as you walked in the tower door, that faced the lobby, valet, and all the busy-ness of a hotel on Friday night. The screen door opened up directly to the driveway to valet, an inferior room that we wondered was maybe the result of being a 'discount purchaser'. You get what you pay for?! The bathroom was tiny and the tub still had hair and stains in it. So we asked for another room and were given a 2nd floor one in another building. When we went to check the 2nd room out, thinking it was on the first floor because our room number started with '1', the hallway on that floor was littered with room service plates, nats and bugs flying around them, and the smell of sweet-dampness (kind of how bad fruit smells). It was syrup... and fruit... and eggs, pancakes, jam - seen on the many plates outside almost every other room door, that were obviously sitting out from breakfast - at 3pm in the afternoon! Came to find out odd room numbers were on the top floor, made our way up the stairs (no elevator) to our 2nd room. Soon as we opened the door, there was the most terrible PEE and musty smell in this room. We wanted to give it a try anyway (and not be headaches to the front desk), opened windows and turned on the ceiling fan (a plus) but couldn't get rid of the smell. We thought maybe the carpet had been cleaned and not dried properly, but soon found out when we tried to put our kids drinks in the room fridge that it was old, moldy, brown and rusty inside, emanating that old, foul smell. No wonder the room was damp and stinky! We called front desk to complain ... again. And were given a room a few doors down from the second, that was better - new fridge, mildly damp smell (maybe the humidity in San D ). So overall a *decent* stay, but here's the thing - NOT WHAT YOU'D EXPECT OF A 4 STAR by any means. Rooms need a facelift out of their 'floridian retiree' style into something more modern and cheek (beachy can be chic). I guess the only good thing in the rooms - Crabtree & Evelyn bath products.

I had just gotten out of the shower and needed to get dressed, do my hair, etc. The staff sent someone up and gave me another credit, however I was late to my morning appt. because I could not use the bathroom to get ready!

Very friendly lady, she inquired about the children each day and asked if we were having a good time. Actually all the staff we met were very friendly, including receptionists. The pool area is beautiful and the pool is large and deep. It was supposedly heated, but too cold for me. Our kids enjoyed it though. At the time we were there, it was cool and rainy so they only swam once. The beach area is very nice and they offer bike and boat rentals. Quite expensive though. There is a Starbucks in the lobby area which we used, but even those prices were inflated. We did not use the restaurant or room service. Overall the resort was a good experience. The price of $64/night (on priceline) was amazing for such quality. The downside was a parking fee of $14/day. Well, it is a resort after all. We visited Old Town for a day and thoroughly enjoyed it. My husband is not into Mexican food so we didn't eat anything there, which is a shame because a lot of places looked interesting. Touring the old buildings was fun and educational.

No elevator in the Villas. They resemble motel-type buildings. The room itself was quite good, with the usual Hilton comforts and conveniences. Work desk was located away from the door (good).

We also had a room overlooking the bay from there (7th floor), however this building was sooo noisy. It was the first time in my life that I had to use ear plugs at night.

In the toilets they use the same system as on airplanes, where it is not flushed, but sucked in instead and you can hear the noise from all toilets around you in your hotel room. Parking is $14, but there is no alternative choice of parking on the road and we thought that is a bit of a \"rip off\". There is nothing at all around the hotel in terms of bars or restaurants, but we drove to San Diego downtown (Gaslamp district) where you can find plenty and it is only 10 minutes away (app. $20 from the hotel). They also have a \"watersport area\" at the hotel and we rented a jet ski ($100 for 1 hour) and went out on the bay and that was great fun.

We bid $100/night and it was taken by the Hilton San Diego Resort. The location was nice bc it was on Mission Bay. Along the drive to the hotel on E. Mission Bay Dr., you can see people barbecuing, flying kites, on their wave runners on the bay, and children playing on the large playgrounds. It was a neat sight to see, especially with the sun shining on the water, making it sparkle! We arrived at the hotel at 2pm to check in. (Check in is actually listed as 4 p.m..) Upon checking in, they asked if I wanted to valet all 4 days I would be there, or if I'd like to self park. The valet parking is $16/day or $14/day to self park. I thought this idea was completely ridiculous! You receive a piece of paper to place on your dashboard to show what dates they are valid from. But... Who really polices this? Parking was very tight and it was nearly impossible to park close by to our building each day. We soon realized people were parking on the street instead. Had we known this, we wouldn't have agreed to the self park upon checking in. Upon checking in, we had no bellhop assist with our luggage, nor offer, even though he was just standing there looking straight at us. Rather than offering to take our bags, he jumps over to another person in line and offers to take their bags, even though I got there first. We have checked in to many 4 and 5 star hotels before and have never received service like this before. Aside from the lazy and unattentive bellhop, service didn't get any better. We requested a room overlooking the bay over the telephone before our trip, and the agent said they'd honor that. Much to our disappointment, the person who checked us in said, \"Well, we already have you set up in the room.\" No big deal. We were on the 1st floor in the building over looking the parking lot. What a view and the noise! Was this not negotiable because I obtained this room through priceline bid? The room was very clean, beds were very well made, and toiletries were stocked every day. Just like in any other hotel, they won't change the towels for clean, new ones, unless you put them on the floor. Towels were so hard and crunchy! For a 4 star hotel, you'd think along with the soft, high thread count sheets, they'd have soft towels. Again, very minor. In the restroom, it had granite countertops, good water pressure, but an ugly sight below the countertop. The front of the counter is actually a faux cabinet door, and is one big piece of wood. It was coming apart and was really ugly. Aside from that, the furniture was pretty basic. The room had a kin size comfortable bed, 2 side tables, a table with a mirror in front of it (which was great when I was doing my hair in the mornings), with a chair, a comfortable arm chair, and dresser drawers with a flat screen tv on it. All in all, we had a great vacation sight seeing, but we're wondering how the heck this hotel has a 4 star rating?
