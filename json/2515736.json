I will attest to the fact that while the rooms are not the Ritz Carlton (this is a beach place), you simply cannot find a better deal at the beach. Located in a nice area it is surrounded by a handful of restaurants, a grocery store, and two of the few gas stations in the area; The Beachcomber is close enough, but yet far enough away from the nightlife PB has to offer. It is a short 2.5 block walk down to the world famous Tourmaline Surf Park and at the base of La Jolla's Mt. Soledad. The beaches of La Jolla and Pacific Beach, Crystal Pier, Belmont Park, Sea World, and Downtown San Diego are all within a few miles or less. For the person who is looking for an inexpensive place to stay, who plans on seeing the sights and not huddling in their hotel room (who does that anyway), this is an excellent deal at less than $300 per week. The staff is very attentive and there for you whenever you need them. I've even seen them helping tenants out at midnight. The two women who work in the office were absolutely of the best caliber. They really care about this place, and are intent on making your stay enjoyable. I would definitely recommend the Beachcomber for anyone who is traveling through the area and wants to stay at the beach without forking over hundreds of dollars a night. Keep in mind, this is a beach place and should be considered as such. Think about your home town. What type of room do you get at a discounted rate of less than $40 per night. This is as nice or nicer. Enjoy your stay, you won't regret it!", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201c\"Don't expect the 'Hilton' .. good value for a WEEKLY studio-type room\"\u201d", "Author": "dtabse", "ReviewID": "UR110339972", "Content": "I had lived in Pacific Beach before and upon moving back needed an affordable and convenient place to stay while in 'transition' looking for housing rentals.

Not only are the rooms a joke; dirty linens with stains, carpeting that smells, showers that barely have pressure, very loud with kids & traffic, et al., the staff is comprised with ex-druggies who lack teeth and are very unpleasant. They conduct in illegal activity for long term stays. BE WARNED: If you stay more than 28 days they insist you move to another room. THIS IS COMPLETELY ILLEGAL ACCORDING TO SAN DIEGO HOUSING AUTHORITY. If they ask you to do this, you can be awarded $500 by turning them into San Diego authorities. Do not let them get away with this illegal maneuver. They are VERY unfriendly to foreign guests. They advertise free Wi-Fi - Only about 3 rooms get a signal and those are REALLY slow. Street noise is very loud and a bar next door plays very loud music until late at night.

Front office staff is awesome. They were very friendly and quiet knowledgeable. They went out of their way to make sure my stay was nothing but the best. Very clean rooms, clean sheets and towels. All windows were sparkling and they have the cleanest bathrooms I have seen yet. Not to mention the landscaping beautiful jobs. All rooms look like they were just painted. You could not ask for more. There is a variety of eating places including pizza.burgers,tacos and even The French Gourmet Restaurant it is to die for. There is a grocery store,bakery, laundry mat ,several gift shops and even yes a Chocolate store. There is nothing more you could want, honest. This is a great place to come and get away and just relax... No one ever bothers you wow how awesome is that. This is a great place for a awesome price in PB.

Upon finding an ad on the San diego craigslist I found an ad for BeachComber Shores. When I first mailed in my payment to secure the room 3 months before flying in, I asked the management repeatedly to send me a receipt. Every time I called the attendant would give an excuse to why it had not been sent. Upon flying in to San Diego and Picking up my Car Rental, I drove to the property which was disgusting externally, we still wanted to give the place a chance maybe the inside would be more accomidable. I had to park the rental next to a trailer on bricks who probably pays for the lot space to live there. The on-site live-in attendant was kind enough to leave a note with a number so we can retrieve the key. . Only problem is she wrote down six digits instead of 7. Walking in the premesis the pungent smell of marajuana was obvious. We asked a group Cholo residents loitering in the cortyard If they knew where the landlord is, they were kind enough to help, after yelling \"SHEILLLLLLAAAA\" through her screen window, she emerged with no shoes on, and showed us to our rooms. We had the choice of one room, you can feel the floorboard underneath the carpet shift around while we inspected the room, the bed felt like a boxspring on top of a boxspring. The ad on craigslist gives the reason for the value on the rooms are because there is no room service and no air conditioning. I am accustomed to San diego weather so that was not a problem for me, only thing is 3 of the windows in the room were glued shut. the only ones we could open up were facing the street, we could hear every step a person or every cough a person made outside, let alone the sound of traffic. The windows were substandard it had some sort of archaic swing out contraption, it was evidentthe exterior of the complex was suffering from decay, must have not been remodeled since at least the early 60's. I was afraid to leave my lapotp there and belongings let alone my girlfriend there alone if I wanted to hit the waves surfing early morning. We stayed in the room a total of 1 hour since the time we checked in and the only other room that was vacant during the holiday was 20 miles away in Poway. The attendant denied us a refund due to the fact the Supervisor was unavailible durning Jul4th. We returned the next morning only to hear that $100 was to be subtracted from our refund, and it would be mailed to us. I did not even recieve a receipt how could I trust them to send me a refund? Management decided to argue with us, the most inconsiderate response came from the supervisor, \"Unlike you two, not fulfilling your commitments we will fulfill ours and mail your refund\" Never have I heard a businessperson question their customers character. After finally thretening legal action we obtained our refund minus the security deposit of $100 dollars. It felt so good to drive away from the shantytown wreck we nealy had to spend a whole nother week in, I give credit to those who could bear spending just one night in one of those rooms.
