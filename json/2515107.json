The location of this hotel is great-2 min walk to line 7 (Cadet) and about 6-8min walk to line 8+line 9 (Grand Blv). You can reach wherever you want to visit by the metro system in Paris. Further, the Roissy Bus stop is only 6.4 Euro cost for a taxi in daytime. I realized that people are complaining on the room size, which I have to admit is not very spacious but still tolerable. As my wife and I took our four-year-old daugher with us, the hotel added a bed for the girl and this made the room even smaller. BUT, you can still easily turn around and put the big suitcases in! The wall is not sound proof, but this quite natural around Europe. The breakfast is not rich but still you can feed yourself.

We returned to Paris this past December to spend Christmas in the magical City of Lights. Of course, we booked our reservation at the Opera Cadet for the trip! Since we knew the city would be busy for the holidays, we booked our reservation over 6 months in advance, as it was they only had three rooms available for the week of Christmas. Word of warning... if traveling to Paris on a major holiday such as Christmas, be sure to book your room early. Anyway, when flying to Paris for my second visit, I wondered if the hotel would seem as wonderful as my first trip to the city, after all, I had stars and magic in my first visit to this wonderful city! It turns out, the repeat journey was just as good as the first! For those of you that money is no option, you might want to book a more glamorous hotel. For those of you on a shoestring budget, you can book a hotel that is less expensive. But for the average traveler, you can't go wrong with the Opera Cadet. Affordable prices, very clean rooms, and I can't stress enough... the friendliest most helpful staff you could hope for. While not in the touristy areas near the Eiffel Tower or Notre Dame, this charming hotel is in a quiet arrondissement that is minutes from all the sites by the Metro. Plus, there is a Metro stop directly across the street from the hotel, what could be easier to get around? Buy your Metro pass and forget about the buses and taxis, plus the Metros are happening places that are perfect for people watchers such as us! Another great benefit of the Opera Cadet location is the plethora of great shops on its street, Rue de Cadet. We bought oysters on the street from a vendor... the best oysters we have ever eaten, so fresh you could taste the brine and they put those here in the States to shame. Wine shops, charcuteries, delis, bakeries, chocolate shops, produce stands, it was all literally steps from the hotel entrance. This was our second trip staying at the Opera Cadet, but it won't be our last.

At the first visit, I stayed at standard double room for 1 night, and superior room (Aida room on 6th floor). Standard room is per its name: standard, with parisian size (should be petit size). Superior room at that time is much better but relatively more expensive. At that time, we love location of this hotel (less than 50 m to Metro station and being in the rue having lots of food and grocery shops), but the place definitely renovation. When we came back here again, we already found it had very good face lift. This time we try to upgrade to superior room (reserve on-line with standard double room). They ended up give us Camen room (on 6th floor also). It's actually quarduple room, so space is very comfortable for me and my wife. We use the 2 single bed to store our luggage and things, and sleep on queen size (in our standard) bed. Lobby is expanded with bar facility (open til midnight) and very nice garden at the back of the hotel. (So, if you take standard room, good to ask for 2-4 floor facing back of the hotel. You will have garden view). They put 2 new elevators (from 1 very old elevator), with 'Close' button which most typical paris hotel not have....... One comment for room. They now put chain lock also, which did not have in my first visit. It make me feel much safer during sleep. Overall, staff is helpful. Breakfast is improved also (from truly parisian breakfast - no meat at all, only boiled egg, pastries, juice, coffee/tea, cereals).

The breakfast featured hard boiled eggs, breads, croissants, pastries, cold cuts, cheese, and some cereals.

I'll be the first to point out that the service was impeccable, every staff member was incredibly nice and accommodating. Baring the house cleaning, they all spoke perfect English and there was nothing too big for them. Free buffet breakfast was also quite nice (good croissants and pastries); however, it was limited and, for a continental buffet with cold meats (useless to us vegetarians) they could have had cheeses, but considering it is covered in the room cost, it's not bad at all. On the whole, the hotel was good value as well. However, that's where the positives end. The hotel was quite run down and the room was nothing special, perhaps one of the ugliest I've ever stayed in. My wife and I also didn't appreciate getting a smoking room, when we clearly asked for non-smoking. One of the lifts was also down for repairs which made using the lift annoying. The carpet on our floor (the top one) also had plastic taped to it, which made it look horrible and was quite unprofessional as well, wrecking the already outdated decor. The bed was also shocking, the worst I've ever had at a hotel; it was bumpy, shifted in weird positions and it made sleeping almost impossible. Location was also not great, whilst there were restaurants, cafe's, a Macca's and a metro station nearby (the metro station being across the road), it was too far away from most attractions (such as the Louvre, Arc de Triumph, Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and Eiffel Tower). In fact, to get to most attractions, you need to catch two or three trains to get to. It's a fair drive to CDG airport and is quite a trek to the Gare du Nord train station, making the location only average. In the end, if I ever went to Paris again (which I doubt), I'd look elsewhere, it's not a bad hotel and the price is pretty good, but the hotel really is run down and the bed in our room should have been put in the tip a decade ago.

The hotel was not cheap but we had booked through Airmiles so it was a bit of a treat compared to previous holidays in the city. The hotel has private parking but it was VERY tight getting the car (Audi estate) in and out as we had to park in the lower area - you can see paint on the walls where cars have scraped them. Having said that, it is a useful benefit. All the staff were really friendly and helpful and the rooms were very clean. We had a family room which was very large with proper beds rather than any sofa bed/foldaway type set up. The courtyard garden is very pretty and all the communal areas are very spacious. The hotel is in a great area between two metro lines and you can buy carnets of tickets for the metro & buses in the vending machine in reception which is very handy and saves you having to queue in the metro stations. The hotel is situated close to some nice restaurants, we would recommend Le General Lafayette (turn right out of hotel then left along Rue Lafayette - number 52) and also Chartiers (turn left out of hotel, then left at the corner on to Rue du Fauborg Monmartre - number 7) . You need to get to Chartiers early, ideally before 7pm as it's very popular. We had heard this so went on our first night and by the time we left the restaurant just after 8pm the queue to get in was baout 20 meteres long! There is a great little bar/bistro at the end of the road (left out of the hotel) which we always visited on the way back to the hotel to revive ourselves and it's a great place to sit and watch people.

I chose Opera Cadet over two other chipper 3 star hotels in the same area, mostly because of the reviews here on this site, thinking it is better to pay a bit more for the extra comfort. The hotel was really excellent! To begin with, its location is perfect! right in the center of Paris, several Metro stops from every main attraction of the city, plus the metro itself is like half a minute walk from the hotel entrance (just outside the hotel, other side of the street). There are a lot of restaurants (from fast food to patisseries etc.) all around the hotel, including a Kosher deli across the hotel if it interests anyone, and the neighborhood is very safe and inviting. The hotel itself is very modern and clean, I really have nothing bad to say. The rooms were perfect (we had a Quadro room, very specious for a 3 star European hotel), there is free WiFi in the hotel (not trivial at all!!), a free safe in each room, showers are perfect. Breakfast is served in a very nice spot in the hotel, very romantic, and was more then enough (including fruits, cornflakes, yogurt, hot chocolate and more!). Only complaint I had was that my brother, who had to rooms (double and triple), and requested adjoining rooms in advanced, did get the rooms on the same floor but separate by two rooms in the middle, which made his vacation a complete hell (with the kids running in the hallway from room to room all the time).

Beds were a bit on the soft side but were fine. Room had a small tv, safe, free wifi and more than enough space for the two of us (when you're in Paris, you spend more time out and about anyway). The hotel is in a great location - right next to a Metro stop and on a fabulous street with a number of bakeries, cafes and restaurants. It's a short walk to the Galleries Lafayette, and we often walked to the heart of some of the key tourist attractions (but also just as easy to jump on the metro). The staff are very friendly and the free breakfast every morning was plentiful with fresh coffee and tea served as well. Only downside on the first stay was that they were in the middle of re-painting our floor during the last few days of our stay, and the paint smell was quite strong. Notification of this would have been nice. On my return visit in June, I was on a higher floor. Had a queen size bed and it was a bit more comfortable than the previous twin bed.

At around 2 am in the morning people shouting and singing wake us up and this noise went on all night. So, imposible to sleep. It was as if there were no windows in the room.

The area is great, with many places to eat and close by supermarkets, it also makes a nice walk to the Sacre Coeur and Le Pigalle (very chic!). I liked the fact that our room was ready, even when we got there well before two, and that check-out was at 12pm. As we had lots of spare time before our train back to London, we left the luggage in a safe room at Reception without any problem. On the negative side, I made the mistake of buying a small bottle of mineral water from the bar when we went back to the hotel at night and it cost me 2.50 euro; my advice is buy the water or any drink from the shop opposite the entrance or from a supermarket (they close quite late), it will definitely be cheaper!

Booked hotel as part of a package with Eurostar. Although Eurostar offer a number of hotels this 3 * appeared good value and had some very strong reviews from Tripadvisor members. As always, these reviews proved helpful and given the number already on the site i'll only flag up the key points. Location - Good location adjacent to the Cadet metro stop on line 7. While we used public transport the hotel does also have its own underground car park at around \u20ac15 per day I think. There are a number of restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel of various budgets as well as a MacDonalds/Mccafe if you are desperate! No issue with noise at all which was an absolute bonus. Room - We booked a quad as i've two teenage children. Room was functional but obvious with 1 double and 2 singles was a little cosy. Saying that we didn't have any issues with this as we were in Paris. Storage and wardrobe space is adequate although the location of the warddrobe is adjacent to the door and may not be obvious at first. Bathroom was clean and functional. There is a mini-bar, if you want it, and a TV with a variety of French and European programmes. For English speakers you get BBC World, BBC1 and CNN. Food - we booked a B&B and ate in the downstairs restaurant in the morning. Food was continental and it would have been a bonus to get hot pastry or other items. Saying that the quality was good albiet a little limited. We had to queue one morning for a table which was a pain but this was resolved in minutes. Design of chairs in restaurant could be better as it is a real struggle entering and exiting your table when you have other diners behind. Hotel - For those of a certain age think Jean Michel Jarre. Yes this hotel has a real eighties theme down to the grey colour scheme of our bathroom to the chunky furnitue and art deco style of the rooms and corridors. Not that we had a problem with this as it gives Cadet Opera a degree of individuality. No where did we find any issues with dirt or poor maintenance with the staff more than happy to help out. As such i'd recommend if you are looking for a value option just a few minutes metro ride outside of town and around 10 minutes walk to Gare de Nord.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cComfortable cozy hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "twins7777", "ReviewID": "UR84759423", "Content": "Clean comfortable cozy hotel.

The lobby area of the hotel was very nice and professional looking, the bedroom was spacious, clean, with minibar/fridge, electronic safe. The bizzare thing in the bathroom was that the shower was not directly above the bath (see picture) meaning that the shower head had to be held in order to shower, and a few of the non French TV channels were not working but no big deal. Breakfast was nice, buffet continental with a choice of fresh croissants, pastries, bread, cereal, yoghurt, boiled eggs, fresh fruit, juice, tea and coffee - a good choice of food. Upon arrival at the hotel when checking in the receptionist did not seem to have any record of my booking (booked through Lastminute.com) and had to ask me for my paperwork, which fortunately I had with me and she checked me in. But I found this lady to be rather unhospitable, a smile would have been nice! She didn't smile until the day I left?! Another man in reception was also the same - no smile. They spoke English though but that left me not wanting to ask them for help or advice, I was given an information sheet with give directions to the main sights and places of interest, so I didn't have to bother them. For me that was a real shame, because they're in the business of hospitality, customers should feel like they can approach staff. The chambermaids and breakfast staff however were lovely, big smiles and chatty!

We don't usually trust 3 star hotels, particularly in big cities, but the reviews on Cadet were encouraging so we decided to risk it. We needn't have been concerned, the reception staff were friendly and explained that the room was not quite ready but if we would like to leave our luggage and go have some lunch, it would be fully serviced on our return, and it was. The double room was not large, but perfectly adequate as we were there to see Paris not the inside of a hotel room. Frankly, I've stayed in smaller rooms in London 4 star hotels. This was clean, had everything we needed, aircon, fresh towels & toiletries each day, multi channel TV, a window that opened, and a very comfortable bed. Breakfast was excellent for France, where we've often just got rolls & coffee - cereals, fresh fruit, yoghurts, croissants, pastries, baguettes, OJ, tea or coffee, all in a light, pleasant room or at outside tables in an enclosed courtyard with fountain. There's a bar and a spacious conservatory, two lifts to all 6 floors, and an underground car park if you're mad enough to brave the Paris traffic. Metro station & bus stop 20 seconds from the front door but it's only a 15 minute walk to l'Opera & we walked back from the Latin Quarter one night in under 30 minutes, so it's well placed. The Rue Cadet has a lovely bread/cake shop across from the hotel and a range of small shops and cafe/brasseries, and there are plenty of restaurants within a 5 minute walk. Hotel staff in Paris do not have the best reputation for politeness and friendliness but the folks here were unfailingly pleasant & helpful.

The rooms are, of course, quite small, but that is standard for Paris and must be expected.

Fortunately, because the room was so warm (I could never get the temperature to drop below what I thought was way too warm--but then I found most indoor places to be too warm--apparently, Parisians turn the heat up high when the weather is cold), I left the window open much of the time to air the room out. And, I liberally sprayed with Febreze that I had packed \"just in case\" of smoke issues.

From the moment we arrived we knew that it was going to be ideal for our needs. With a 3 day midweek break in Paris and plans to see the majority of the major sights while we were there the opera Cadet catered for all our needs. The breakfast in the morning is mainly a self service of mainly continental fare, but also cereals and fruits are available and the croissant and french bread are a must, try them with some of the jams or honey, bloody marvelous! and the strong coffee will keep you going for most of the day. The staff at the Opera Cadet are most courteous and extremely helpful with tips and advice. we sought to travel around the city, as this was our first time in Paris we wanted to be sure, and the best way to find out is to ask a local! They gave us the easist and fastest ways to get around. Very helpful indeed. there is a tall younger member of reception staff who wears glasses, who's name we didn't get but he was in particular very friendly and helpful. Our room was very adequate and by Paris standards quite large, with the usual ensuite and a 3rd floor view of the street below. Equipped with a mini-bar this I thought was a nice touch but a bit expensive for a beer or a short, the only thing I could mention was the carpet, it was a bit grubby, but I guess mainly caused by guests who used the mini-bar. the bed was firm and comfortable for both of us but has a seriously starched undersheet! took a bit of getting used to but after a days touring and a hearty meal, you will have no problem falling asleep. One last point we were delayed on arrival to Paris and I was to be honest a bit troubled as to whether our room would be held, but there was no problem at all when we arrived. If you are arriving at Charles De Gaulle Airport and are using the Paris Shuttle Mini bus service, they are also excellant, but be aware that the the airport is a bit of a maze the first time, and if you are to be met at exits 16-19 make sure that you go down stairs after you've claimed your baggage.

Great hotel\u201d", "Author": "GJR1969", "ReviewID": "UR14515438", "Content": "I have come to this hotel in March every year for over 10 years and have really grown to love it. As most of the reviews here show, it really is a good value and in a nice neighborhood The good points: 1) Reasonably sized rooms for Paris - those who complain about the small size of the rooms have not spent much time in Paris. I always go with another person and with a little creative unpacking - things going behind the sofa etc., it is fine 2) Very clean. I don't know what a couple people here experienced but I has always had a very clean room in 10 years of staying there. 3) Rates that are competitive and on par with other Parisian hotels 4) A nice breakfast that can allow you to really save on lunch costs if you eat heartily 5) Direct access to a subway station. On the same line as the Louvre or the Parc de La Villette Interactive Science Center. You can be there in Central Paris in 10 minutes, without changing lines. Also multiple buses. What many don't know is that there are also 3 other metro stations within walking distance: Grand Boulevards, Notre Dame de La Lorette and Richelieu-Druot 6) A vibrant Parisian neighborhood where you can see actual merchants and actual Parisians in their daily routines, not just people bussed in to work at tourist shops. It is a multi-ethnic neighborhood with many good restaurants, delis and shops, the Folies Bergeres (which until recently hosted Cabaret), theaters, the large area of Montmartre etc. 7) Close proximity to supermarkets so you can save money and buy prepared foods, sodas, water etc. 8) A lovely caring staff. Helene, Phillipe, Christoph, Jacques and the rest have all been wonderful. They have always been extremely accommodating and wonderful - from fixing a problem in the room (once a technician came like lightening after the safe malfunctioned and my theater tickets were inside) to helping tourists with their questions from the most basic (How do I get to the Eiffel Tower) to the most advanced (What is the best route to get to Malmaison, previous residence of Napoleon's Josephine outside Paris, to questions about flights etc.) While I am obviously a big fan of the hotel, I truly cannot think of any problem or issue that has occurred in a decade which was not solved quickly. The maids can be a little grumpy at times but beyond that, I am really hard pressed to think of bad things to say. While I was not there for the situations that a small number of people complained about I can say that in my experiences over a decade have shown that the quality and service are consistently excellent. Bottom line: As long as you have the right expectations, you'll be fine: 1) Rooms are notoriously small in Paris. The room sizes at the Opera Cadet are quite adequate to ones even around the corner 2) It is not a brand new hotel in the 1st district but you get good value for your money. If you can \"endure\" a 7-10 minute subway ride, you are in the very center of Paris 3) If you do encounter any problem, you will be amazed at how helpful the staff is to get the problem resolved quickly. Believe me, I have stayed in many hotels in France and have very often seen the staff which is not helpful. 4) With a little planning, you can save a good deal - by going to the supermarket for a few meals or lunch or going for one night or so to the many ethnic restaurants - Indian, Chinese, Japanese in the area. There is also a wonderful deli a few doors down which has a new 8.50 euro menu, entree + dessert.

We booked the hotel through a travel agent as an airfare/hotel package. We could tell from the photos on the website and Trip Advisor comments that it was not a particularly charming hotel, but we expected it to be comfortable. When we arrived we were told that the reservation was for two twin beds. Oddly, this happened to us before on another trip booked by the same travel agent, so this time I had been sure to specify in advance that we preferred a queen bed. \u201cQueen bed requested\u201d was clearly noted on our prepaid hotel voucher and in the email I sent to confirm the room prior to our arrival (to which I received a positive response), so I don\u2019t know why they said we booked a room with two twin beds. After a pointless argument we were told that a room with a double bed happened to be available. We rode up in the creaky elevator with our bags. The room was tiny with barely enough space to walk around the bed and almost no room for the luggage. The carpet and walls were stained, the armchair was faded and threadbare, and the room reeked of smoke. We tried to turn on the fan to get some air moving, but it did not work, so my husband went downstairs to inquire about it. He was told that they are required by law to turn off the AC in September, that there are non-smoking rooms, but none were available at that time, and that they can\u2019t keep people from smoking in those rooms so there would be no difference anyway. We kept the window open the whole time we were there. It\u2019s going to sound like the Princess and the Pea, but the sheets were so rough and scratchy my skin was red after just one night. We seriously considered changing hotels, but we had prepaid and really didn\u2019t want to go to the trouble, so the second day we asked to upgrade to a larger room, which cost 20 Euros/night and was well worth it. Like the first room, the second had stained carpet, broken fixtures and hardware, and shabby furniture, but it was reasonably clean. There was much more space and by that time I had learned to sleep with as much skin covered as possible. A simple breakfast is included in the price of the room and is surprisingly satisfactory. The staff at the desk did make some effort at being helpful during our stay. When we checked out they told us we had had two drinks from the mini bar, which we denied (we didn\u2019t even open the mini bar in either room) and they immediately removed the charge.

We had a good experience on both occasions. While the Opera Cadet is not a luxury hotel, it provides clean and reliable lodging in a central Paris location in the 9th arrondisement (not on the Ile de France as captioned on Trip Advisor). The hotel caters to tourists, many of whom hail from the U.S., Spain and the UK. Like many European hotels, the Opera Cadet has small rooms, especially by U.S. standards. But the rooms are clean, the guestroom plumbing is new and well-functioning (far better than at many other European properties), and the breakfasts-- included in the room rate-- are quite good. You'll also have a variety of international newspapers in the lobby, including English-language publications, as well as good television reception-- including English language channels-- in your room. And if the rooms aren't luxury, neither are the rates-- the Opera Cadet offers a fair rate for its rooms. All told, the Opera Cadet is a good value for tourists who want a reliable, well-located Paris establishment. The best thing about the Opera Cadet is its location in a delightful, residential shopping street on the border of Montmartre and the Opera District. You can walk to many of Paris's most notable sites (the Louvre is a walk of less than 30 minutes), and the Metro is nearby. There are also some excellent restaurants in the immediate neighborhood-- try Pre de Cadet for traditional French cuisine, and either El Mauresque or Chez Leon for Moroccan food. Service at the Opera Cadet can vary from solicitous to overly reserved. We've experienced both, depending on the person attending the desk.

The tub/shower was very high and required climbing to get in and out, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend to someone elderly or who can\u2019t physically manage the rather significant climb. They did accommodate a last-minute request to change to two beds when my daughter unexpectedly showed up, however the extra person charge was high - $24/night which did include breakfast, but the breakfast was very basic and we got pretty tired of it quickly. Regarding some previous reviews: Yes, the hair dryer is very weak \u2013 bring your own. There is no longer a charge to use the safe! Yes, there is a charge to use the computer in the lobby-however, you can use the printer that they maintain as much as you want and they supply the paper.

Regarding restaurants, the recommended ones were mediocre. We had a very bad experience at Le Pre Cadet. We arrived at 7:00pm, and the restaurant was empty, so we apologized for not having reservations and asked an older gentlemen (the owner I believe) if he might be able to accommodate us. He told us we were lucky he had a cancellation and seated us. He was very nice through the meal until the restaurant got crowded and he moved the diners next to us to a larger table. We were within 10 minutes of leaving at that point. Then he returned to our table and rudely and sternly told my daughter that when you come without a reservation it makes a problem for him. She apologized but was very upset, as was I. Then he put a check on the table next to us. We were not sure it was ours, so we tried to get his attention to ask. When we asked, he flipped (threw) the portfolio rudely onto our table. The diners next to us were also appalled. My daughter left the restaurant to wait outside because she was humiliated and angry. On my way out I tried to talked to him about how upset he made us and explained that we would have understood if he had not wanted to seat us and he should have turned us away if it was going to be a problem. He just kept repeating at length what a problem we caused him. When we returned to the hotel, we explained all this to our concierge, and he made a call to the restaurant. He talked to the owner, and the owner LIED and said it was the waiter who must have done this. I do NOT recommend this restaurant. I DO recommend Le Petit Zinc in the St. Germaine district.

We booked the hotel through needahotel.com and found it great value for money. On arrival we were checked in quite speedily and allocated to our room. The double room we were allocated to was very very small.. the bed looked like a childs bed definitely not suited to two adults. The bathroom was also tiny you couldnt fit two people standing in it.. however the main problem was the noise of birds!!!!..there was some sort of garden to the rear of our room and there was 100's of birds- therefore the noise was very annoying.. needless to say we went straight down to reception and requested another room..the second room allocated to us was perfect (well in terms of value for money that is!) the room was on the 6th floor, number 606 serviced by two lifts. It was like the attic conversion of the hotel as the windows were on the roof if you get my drift...the shower room was very spacey and had a large mirror across the wall of the room and there was a nice hand basin with plenty of comfy clean towels..the toliet was in a seperate room within the room and that also had a hand basin in it.. so i thought that was a nice touch we could both be getting ready at the same time. The bed was so so comfy in fact very hard to pull ourselves out of it in the mornings and the room service was very prompt each morning..the breakfast on offer consisted of a choice of juices- grapefruit or orange and then breads/pastries and the likes of tea and coffee etc.- i think if you went down to the breakfast room there was a slightly better offering i.e cerels, yougharts etc.. anyway back to the room it just goes to show that there are different types of rooms available for the same price in money so dont be afraid to ask if your not happy first time round!! Other points- the people on reception were quite helpful and the location is adjacent to a metro and mcdonalds..the road the hotel is on reminds me of a smaller scale of moore street in dublin with the stall sellers, although much quieter but very nice...now for the services in the hotel.. well as another traveller quoted the hotel bar is not great at all.. it consists of a counter top and a couple of stools in the main entrance to the hotel.. there is no nice tables, comfy chairs etc so dont be expecting much here.... the hotel has a luggage room which was very handy for ourselves as our flight back to dublin wasnt until 9.30pm and we went off to disney for the day, so they were perfectly safe when we came back. Overall most importantly excellent location, well serviced by metro and buses a stone throw from all the sights, excellent room (2nd time round) and great value for money.. would recommend this to people not fussed about luxury and would certainly stay here again.. oh one last thing for the ladies, the hair dryers are crap- bring your own with a european plug!!! i made the mistake of bringing a dryer and not a plug- dooh!

There was also a general store and several fresh fruit and vegetable stands. We were also located right at a subway stop, which made traveling about the city very easy. The only negative things I can say is that the hairdryer in the room didn't work well and the first two nights we didn't sleep well due to being able to hear a man and woman arguing. We weren't sure if the noise was coming from the street or from another room in the hotel. The last two nights all was quiet and we slept very well. Our room was also a little stuffy two nights and the air conditioning is turned off this time of year and cannot be used. These were all minor inconveniences.

The location of the hotel is perfect, in a quiet no-through road with little local shops and stalls, convenient for the metro at the corner and within walking distance of many attractions. I can recommend l'opentour for an orientation of the city, Carte Blanche restaurant near the hotel and the fact that on the 1st Sunday of every month, entrance to most museums is free of charge.

The location was good, although not right in the middle of some of the popular Paris neighborhoods, the location was very convenient.

However, we often just walked to the south to go through neigborhoods while on the way to the Louvre or other sites. The Metro is just like most in other cities, only less expensive. The hotel's staff (especially Chris at the front desk) was friendly, helpful and professional. We had two teenagers with us and because the quad we had booked was taken, they upgraded us to a nice suite. The breakfast was more than adequate, great pastries, fruit, ceral, yogurt, coffee, etc. The dining room staff was pleasant. The front desk staff was always extremely helpful. For instance when I asked for the location of a nearby post office, they simply provided the stamps etc. and mailed them for me. The neighborhood around the hotel was great, lots of little cafes.

We most recently spent 4 nights at the Opera Cadet during World Cup playoffs in late June. We are a professional couple who has traveled extensively, however this was our first stay in Paris. In a word our stay was \"Wonderful.\" Arrived by cab at 10A as we had an overnight flight from the US. Too early to check in so the friendly front desk clerk advised us to store our luggage in their storage room until our room was available. We were told we could have continental breakfast in their courtyard and it was there we felt we'd arrived. Great coffee, juices, croissants and a large selection of baked goods and fruits, yougarts, eggs made us feel alive Onto why people read these reviews... Pros: Location. On a street where there is only delivery and pedistrian traffic. Street houses several great pastry shops, cheese shop, wine shop, groceries and other little stores. Metro was two minute walk for easy transport. We discovered since cab drivers can't drive to the front door of the hotel, just to give the Metro Cadet as your destination. Spotless modern Room was on the 6th floor overlooking the quiet courtyard. Understand the hotel was renovated and soundproofed a few years earlier. The outstanding benefit of this was the addition of air conditioning. What a huge bonus. Room was on the smallish side, but so are nearly all the rooms we've stayed in while in Eupope. Space is at a premium and we knew we were not staying at the Ritz nor were we paying Ritz prices. Room also had the newer darkening curtains. We came back late our first night to find a bottle of wine and nice fruit basket. I'd mentioned we were celebrating a special occasion at check in. WOW, what a nice touch. Great Bath, not too small. Typical Euro size. Great water pressure and enjoyed the comp high end toiletries offered. Plenty of towels offered. Bed. Double sized and comfy. Not pillow top like most US places. Little harder which is fine by us. Nice bedding. Breakfast room and Courtyard. Beautiful. Very busy as the hotel was fully booked the entire stay. No wait for coffee and staff was quick to service tables and restock food items. Tons of touristy brochures were available in the lobby. Front desk had directions to just about all touisty spots. Must mention Jack, the bartender. What a jewel. Great personality and told us we couldn't miss the Sacre Coeur in the Monmartre district. It wasn't even on our list and it ended up being a highlight. Had great dinner in that area. Cons: None Can't think of anything I'd change there. Overall impression of Paris was you had to look hard to find a bad meal, didn't need to dress like a model to fit in and believe it or not...the French people actually like Americans.

It's a 3 minute walk to the subway station, really good access. Upon checking in, I received a double room. The room was decent, I'd give it 2 stars of a standard American hotel. I used to be a platinum member of Marriot, so I know what to look for in hotels. The room was small, but ppl say spacious for Paris standards. There was no alarm clock in the room. If you wanted a iron, you had to go down to the front desk to get one. You'd have to return it back right away, so other ppl could use it. I'd understand if this was a cheap hotel, but it's rated 3 stars! The hair dryer looked like it came from the 70's. My room was facing the street, in the mornings you could hear the noisy traffic. After a few days, I got used to it and was able to sleep through it. So it comes how the hotel is stingy: They charge you $1.50 euro per day to use your in room safe. Give me a break, I've been to Mexico, Asia, and the Carribean all the time, and never once was a charged. My brother came to stay with me midway into the stay, and they wanted me to pay for his breakfast. 12 euro's for a crossant and juice. At first they wanted me to pay supplemental fee's. Talk about trying to get every euro from your customer. I had a double room for 2 ppl (my bro and I).

Finding a good hotel in Paris that can fit 4 people to a room is quite challenging. First, the location. The hotel is on a quiet side-street just off one of the busy avenues in the 9th arrondisement, near Gallerie Lafayette and the Opera. Our room faced the street and noise was not a big issue for us, seasoned city dwellers, although there was some construction being done a few doors up the street. Also, the hotel is steps from the Metro Cadet station which gives access to the wonderful Paris underground transportation. We walked from the hotel to see Paris Story on the day we arrived and it took about 10min. Second, the rooms. The room we were in was small but it fit the 4 beds, was very clean and everything worked. Air conditioning is a treat on hot days. The pillows are quite thin but you can ask for more of them. It was a luxury to have a bath/shower combination - especially for soaking tired feet after a full day walking on cobblestones. Third, the staff. Everyone at the hotel was friendly and very helpful. They gave good directions, provided maps and, in our case, gave excellent advice on how to find a medical clinic and what to expect. Finally, the other niceties. The staff provided extra shampoo/soap and towels. The internet worked well although it was pretty pricey (E20 for 3hr) - that's typical in Europe unless you go to an Internet Cafe. Breakfast was fresh, plentiful and (a complete shocker for the price) included hard-boiled eggs. We saw the staff carrying the baguettes from the bakery across the street so we know the source - and we bought one for ourselves just before we checked out.
