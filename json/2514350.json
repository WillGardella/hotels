I booked this and hoped for the best. We checked in at 3p and immediately got to our room. The lobby has free coffee/tea/oatmeal 24/7. Our room and bathroom were SO CLEAN. The room itself even had room on each side of the king size bed unlike a lot of hotel rooms in NYC where it looks like the bed takes up all the space. We had a flat screen tv, a mini-coffee maker, a tall dresser to hang our clothes up in (on wooden hangers), and night stands with drawers on each side of the bed (with working lamps and a Bible!) The room also had a safe ($2 per day inevitable charge for it), an iron, and an ironing board. Our view was total-NY: skyscrapers. The bathroom has shampoo, lotion, and 2 bars of soap; no conditioner. If you forget anything like a toothbrush or razor, just let the hotel staff know and they'll provide you with whatever you need. The bathroom was clean, tub and toilet were scrubbed to perfection. The hotel boasts a complimentary continental breakfast that includes: 2 different flavored waffles, cereal, eggs, sausages, yogurts, an assortment of donuts/muffins, and juices. There is also FREE WIFI so bring your laptop if necessary. If you're staying Saturday into Sunday, there is free on the street parking, ONLY ON THE COMFORT INN SIDE AFTER 10PM starting Saturday. READ THE SIGN CAREFULLY. There are other streets to park on nearby, just read the signs. Check out time is noon; most hotels I know want you out by 11 latest. I would stay here again and again, but only at the $89 rate (thanks quikbook.com!) Jan-Feb the rates are $89, go up to $189 in March, and by June it's $289.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "mrzkake", "ReviewID": "UR123781094", "Content": "Hotel has no parking & the breakfast servers are disrespectful.

Unless you are traveling with a group of friends, or if you don\u2019t mind staying in hostels and/or having shared bathrooms, a good chunk of your travel budget will be spent in your accommodations. For the price I paid, $110 per night, the Comfort Inn Convention Center was a great bargain that allowed me to have additional funds to enjoy some of the city\u2019s superb restaurants and a couple of Broadway shows. Room: Similarly, to all the other NYC hotels I have stayed in the past, the room is small. This is common and to be expected. If a large room is one of your requirements, you might want to try staying in Brooklyn or Long Island City. However, you must also take the subway fare into consideration if you decide to stay outside of Manhattan. The room was appropriate and comfortable. It was cleaned every day, and due to the location of the hotel, it was quiet at night. I believe this is the first time I have stayed in a Manhattan hotel in which I could not hear the traffic below. The hotel provides free wifi in the room, which was useful for making reservations and getting directions. Breakfast: This hotel offers a complimentary breakfast. It is not a huge buffet, but again, I thought it was appropriate for a budget hotel. There were juices, yogurt, whole fruit (banana, apples, and oranges), boiled eggs, bread, English muffin, batter for making waffles, coffee, instant oatmeal, cooked sausage, and some sort of frittata. Of the three nights I stayed there, the breakfast area was only overly crowded in one of the days \u2013 the space is tiny, but again it was not a surprise to us. For this reason, we just grabbed some bananas and yogurt and went on our merry way. Location: For folks who are not familiar with NYC, the location may look a little scary and out of the way, but it was only about two blocks from the nearest metro entrance at 8th and 35st. The hotel location is also an easy walk to Times Square and the Theater District. We even walked all the way to 62th street to catch a movie at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas. The hotel is also within walking distance to Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, and several of the interstate bus stops (Bolt, Megabus, etc\u2026). Returning to the hotel at night was not a problem, but as in any large city, you need to be alert and aware of your surroundings. Overall, I think this is a good hotel if you want to stay in Manhattan, have your own bathroom and you are budget conscious and street savvy. If you need luxury accommodations, large rooms, and to be in the middle of Times Square, you should prepare your pockets and look somewhere else. I certainly plan to stay in this hotel again: It is a clean and quiet place to rest your head in the city that never sleeps.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cMy recent stay\u201d", "Author": "An0nym0us88", "ReviewID": "UR121326126", "Content": "Stayed here for the walk able distance to Javits Convention.. the room is VERY small and I was a little worried to stay here but the room was clean and daily housekeeping.

There just would be so much to write about all the excitement. But the hotel : Great breakfast (omelettes, sausage, make-your-own waffle (plain or blueberry), maple syrup, a variety of muffins, cereal, various bagels with all condiments, juices, good coffee) the downside being the lack of tables. You can load up a tray and go enjoy your breakfast up in your room. Rooms are VERY small (we had room 1000 with 2 double beds looking out 36th street) but everything was functional. The safe works. Beds were clean (oh but i didn't take out a microscope to examine). I have no idea if the tv functions well cause we didn't turn it on. A/C works very well. We drove. There is a public parking at the back of the hotel (entrance is on 35th street). It cost me 25$ (tax included) per 24 hours and I have a toyota highlander.

It may not be the cheapest out there, but we've done worse. Upon arrival we were given a room on the 9th floor. Unfortunately there was a problem with the bed. The handyman (don't have a better name for him) came and had a look at it. Since it couldn't be fixed easily we were given another room on the top floor (15th). Once settled in there everything was great! Apart from that little hurdle at the beginning I can only be positive about the hotel. The general manager, mister M., was very friendly and helpful. The aforementioned handyman was also always friendly and up for some light conversation when we ran into him. The hotel is about 15-20 minutes walking from Madison Square garden / Penn station, add another 10 or so minutes and you're at the Empire State Building. Times Square can be reached on foot as well. If you like aircraft carriers and navy/marine planes, walk to the west and you'll be at the Intrepid Sea/Air/Space museum - worth a visit. The nearest subway station is unfortunately also about 10+ minutes walking - but that shouldn't be a problem for most people. The hotel serves a great breakfast (it's free, but it's pretty tasty!) daily; make your own waffles, a selection of juices, milk, tea, coffee.

Worst hotel experience of my life. Not only did they try to move me to another location 2 miles away (very far from where I had to be), but they stuck me in a smoking room when I finally got my room back (when I specifically booked non-smoking, as proven by the receipt I presented to them). I have horrible allergies to smoke, and the room was truly disgusting with the stink of old cigarettes. Ashes were even left in the ashtray from the previous tenant. I couldn't sleep, and when I told them that it was a real health condition, they were unconcerned. It took a call from my company's CEO before they put an 'air purifier' into my room, which was a little, LOUD blocky fan from 1970 - which shut off every hour, prompting me to get out of bed frequently to turn it back on, for whatever minimal way it was saving my lungs. The window in the room didn't open, either - I would have settled for a window I could open. When the toilet backed up within 10 minutes of checking in, they told me to go out and find a plunger in the hallway. I had to climb over a pile of garbage and vacuum cleaners in the 5th floor landing to finally secure a plunger. The blanket on my bed was badly stained. Needless to say, it was a miserable, disgusting experience. By night 2, I was moved up to the 14th floor, which was MUCH better maintained, had a fancy widescreen TV, no horrible stench, a working toilet, and clean sheets. I actually slept pretty comfortably.

It is not, as someone mentioned close to the flat iron building (think they put the review against the wrong hotel).

The hotel staff couldn't be more helpful even though New Yorkers can appear a touch cold to begin with. The breakfasts are basic.

I'm glad that I read previous trip advisor reviews, which meant that I didn't have high expectations. First, the good - the hotel staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel looks shabby inside and out but the public areas are actually very clean. The king size bed in our room was very comfortable and again the room and bathroom were very clean. The serve yourself breakfast offers a good choice and as much as you want to eat, and similarly the free hot drinks machine available for guests at all times is a welcome facility. Amici 26 on the corner of 36th and 8th is a real find - hot and cold buffet food, homely soups and all sorts of snacks and pastries that you can eat in or take back to the hotel 5 minutes walk away. The less good - the feel of the hotel is more like a hostel. You get used to it quickly but it is a utility experience. The room heater (not working initially but quickly fixed by the maintenance man) pushes out tepid air rather noisily. Similarly the hot water for the bath and shower was too cool for my liking on max although the sink was fine.The location is not bad - a bit distant from the main drag particularly in pouring rain but subways and buses are close by if needed. The bad - definitely the room size, which was tiny by any city's standards. There was nowhere to put our two fairly large cases (we had been travelling in the US previously) and to use the in-room coffee machine provided we would have had to move the wardrobe to get to the power point. We didn't bother and just got drinks from the lobby. We paid maximun price for our two nights ($400 with taxes etc) and this felt overpriced given the very basic nature of the hotel.

Despite complaints from some here I found the place to be an excellent value and an above average all around hotel. The hotel is located between 9th and 10th on 36th street, and I understood complaints about the hotel being located on a pair of dead blocks - 36th between 10th and 8th don't have businesses or stuff on them, just a highway, parking lot, etc. But on 10th and 8th there are businesses so its not like the area is ominous (I'm a single woman who lives in a city), especially during the day it's industrial but not far from shops. I never ended up walking this stretch at night alone, which might have been a wee bit spooky, but this is NYC, the probability you'll take a cab back after a night out is high and that's mostly what I did. At least the location of the place ensures it is quiet, which my room was, on the 14th floor. The room clean and pleasant but tight - like all hotels I've stayed in in NYC - with about 2' of room around a big king bed. The coffeemaker in the room was much appreciated (no place to plug in but the bathroom, but I didn't care) as was free continental breakfast on the ground floor every morning. Hotel staff were very helpful, when asking for directions to a friend's house in Brooklyn one of the staff went so far as to print us out a map of how to get from the train to their place - super nice!

By the end of our visit, our feet were hurting, so we took taxis back from our Broadway shows. They cost us $5-$7 (for all 3 of us). By the way, taxi drivers in NYC are nuts! Fasten your seat belts!

We wanted a similar location and just a place to sleep, shower and shave at a budget price, (leaving more to spend, spend, spend) hence the Comfort Inn, however it was only when I called to confirm our reservations that I found I hadn't booked the 42 W. 35th St location but the one at 442 W. 36th Street. This was my mistake and is the Ugly part. The geographical location isn't too bad - it's the physical location that might put people off. BE SURE WHICH COMFORT INN YOU BOOK. The Bad is that the hotel itself has no street level frontage - you have to go down several steps although there is a lift for wheelchair access. You enter a reception lobby you couldn't swing a cat in which leads into an area of about 6 tables and chairs for the self-service buffet breakfast. We were there on St Patrick's Day and a lot of Irish celebrating the day were staying in the hotel - highlighting the problem of 'get in early if you want a table'. Some reviewers have knocked the choice for breakfast but if you want a quick fuel-up before tackling the sights and shopping, the choices are fine - cakes, bagels, toast, cereals, fruit, fruit juices and hot beverages. We saved a lot of time not having to look for somewhere to eat breakfast and coming back to the hotel late at night, instant hot drinks were very welcome. This was Good. Also Good was the room - twin beds, very clean, linens and towels changed every day - smallish but I've stayed in similar for twice the price. The hotel is too small to have a concierge and depending who's on duty, the staff don't know much about what's going on but they tried hard to help and meant well. Overall, when you take into account the cost, (the \u00a3/$ exchange rate makes everything look cheap), the good outweighs the bad, hence an overall 4 blobs. Would I stay here again? I'd probably try the 35th St one first, followed by the one on West 46th Street but if couldn't get in (I tried once I discovered my mistake but there were no vacancies), then if I was on a budget, I'd give the Comfort Inn on 36th another go - it's really only where it's located that's the problem.", "Date": "March 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Statesville, NC", "Title": "\u201cComfort Inn: off the beaten path\u201d", "Author": "reldnil4", "ReviewID": "UR3281690", "Content": "July 2004, we stayed in the Comfort Inn, W. 36th, between 9th and 10 Avenues.
