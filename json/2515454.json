We tried room service for breakfast and while the cost was considerably cheaper than strip hotels, so was the quality of the food. We wouldn't order room service again here.

Booked hotel based on wanting to not stay on Strip and high Trip Advisor Ranking. I judge hotels by three criteria. 1) Quality of Product (Fail) Room was terrible. Bed was extremely uncomfortable, Sheets and towels were old and of poor quality,vshower was not great and TV channels were of poor quality and selection. $6 Resort Fee is a total rip off. All Mid scale hotels provide free local calls, internet and coffee in room. Charging $6 for local calls (people have cell phones), and internet is only free in the coffee bar not in room. If hotel charges resort fee please include free internet in room. To improve product at a minumum get new beds, Change shower heads and increase water pressure, add more TV channels and incude internet with resort fee. 2) Quality of Service (Great) Guest Service Agent at front dest was very friendly. House keeping was great and kept the room clean. Wait staff in Casino were great. I love to play craps and the casino staff at craps table were great. Lot of energy at craps table and had great fun. Most staff at hotel have worked at hotel for years and make the hotel a great place to hang out. I like to play craps off the strip and The Orleans fits in well for what I look for. 3) Value for Price Paid (Not so Great) I got a package deal, Air, Hotel and Car so the hotel tends to have a deep discounted rate. I would rate value high if I got a decent bed and a good night sleep, this is the basic for any hotel and The Orleans failed in this department. People are naive if they comment that the hotel is in a seedy part of town.

Housekeeping did a wonderful job keeping our room fresh and clean during our stay. Ample spaces in the parking structure. The hotel is off-the-strip, but it didn't matter. The hotel offers free shuttle services and we never waited more than 10 minutes. Maybe that's luck on our part. If there's anything to complain about, it's the location of our room. We had a view of a wall. Oh well. We still enjoyed our time here. For this Vegas trip, we included a visit to the Pinball Hall of Fame and Ethel M's Chocolate Factory. The PHoF is fun if you're into classic arcade games. Ethel M's offers a self-guided tour and has a nice botanical cactus garden. There's also a candy shop on the premises.

TV is not a flat screen, but that is not important to me. I just want to see the morning news and weather. The casino is great. VP machines pay better than the strip and the bartenders were attentive. Table games have lower limits and both the dealers and the players are friendly. For an off-strip casino it's always busy, but not so crowded that you can't find a place to play or eat or whatever. I had a nice dinner at Prime Rib loft where I used my food comp. The Coffee shop is just OK in my opinion. Fridays offers $6 apps after 9pm for a nice late night bite. Not 24 hrs but 2pm is late enough. I do rent a car to make getting around easier.

We have stayed at quite a few hotels in Vegas (including many on the strip), but seem to keep coming back to The Orleans. The pool and jacuzzi area are well maintained and always fun. We saw that they have a free shuttle to the strip, but we didn't use it, so I can't make a comment on that. They have a 70 lane bowling alley, which we've played at in the past with my nephews - was super fun. There are movie theaters, and other fun things for children to do if you have kids. We received a $25 dining credit (along with our free nights), which we used for the Sunday brunch. The brunch was ok - I have to admit that I've had better buffet brunches, but it's nice to eat where you are staying, especially on the day of departure. Check out was smooth - just did it right on the Menu button on our TV.

My H had stayed here a few years back for training and suggested I look into this hotel. I looked online and booked when I thought was cheapest but continued to check on line and called when any of the four nights I booked went lower in price. Each time I called the hotel was very accomodating and gave me the cheaper price. We arrived on saturday and pulled up to the side where check in is. Arrived a little late and called ahead to be sure they kept room, they said they keep rooms until 6am the next morning. Casino is quite large and receprion very nice with marble inlays. Check in quick. They give you a map with the key but easy enough after a walk through to know where everything is. The elevators are somewhat far from doors, and all entrances as far as I could tell, so if you have elderly with you this might be a long walk for them but many had walkers, and seem to do fine. The hotel signs you up for their slot memebership at check in but you have to go to B connected booth to get pin number. After I got my pin, I slid my card and it being my birhtday, a choice of five ballons came up for freebies I picked the blue balloon and got 1000 free points. Room was large. We had our 15 year old daughter and her friend. Two queen beds and large armoire. even with all the drawer space we all chose to live out of our suitcases. I had the chair in sitting area, H had couch, D had desk chair and DF had floor by bed...all had enough space. The casino had a lot of machines that I liked enough \"old school\" and many newbies. The Paradise fishing penny slots by the food court ended up being our favorite, very fun. We ate at the costa catina first night and while a little pricey was good mexican food. The girls had virgin margaritas so they liked it. They have a HH 3-5 except on mon. and tues. when it is closed, the hotel should have this place open evryday in my opinion, but with every meal they give you chips and beans and salsa, all were very good. Another thing this hotel has is a hotdog stand (only 2.00) in the middle of the casino, which I thought was a brillant idea for a midday snack. We had the daily 15 dollar food voucher and with the dollar off the buffet with our b connected card our breakfast buffet for four came to only 21.00, great deal and food was pretty good as far as buffets go. The pool area was nice too, the hot tub was huge and hot which helped monday when it was 65 degrees.

Restaurants are great, the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and the casino is fair to all levels of gaming. My wife had a slight fear of table games and this was one place that I felt i could bring her, teach her a game and not feel pressured by others. The dealers picked up on this very quickly and helped me help her learn the game. There was never a feeling that the casino was tight and that they were just trying to re-coup their comps. One of the other excellent factors of this hotel is the security at the elevators. That is a great feeling to know someone is checking every person that walks by to ensure they are guests. We unfortunately had to stay elsewhere for the rest of the trip and wish we hadn't.

Check-in took less than five minutes. I was given a meal credit, discounts to the movie theater concession area, and discounts to most of the hotel restaurants. You must show a key to the security personnel to gain elevator access 24/7 (which I like). Most strip hotels only require this late night. The rooms are relatively large but dated.

The property is much larger than I remembered and chocked full of ammenties such as bowling, movie theaters, a variety of restaurants, and entertainment. We checked in on a late Sunday afternoon with no wait and were kindly upgraded to a concierge room on the 20th floor. We spent maybe five minutes max during the reception process. While walking to the hotel elevators across the casino, we were met by the noticeably smokey atmosphere typical of older casinos with lower ceilings and aged ventilation systems. As an ex-smoker, the odor really doesn't bother me but both my wife and I noticed that our eyes became noticeably irritated after a few hours on the floor. A security guard is posted at a station near the elevators and while he didn't ask us for room keys that afternoon or during the day, he asked everyone to show their keys at night. We saw other security personnel on elevators and various floors so we felt safe and that any ruckus would be kept to a minimum if not eliminated entirely. We entered our king room and was greeted by a subdued but nicely appointed room with very high ceilings reminiscent of our experiences with older hotels in New Orleans. The door opened immediately to the bedroom area without the usual transition of the bathroom which was at the rear of the room instead. The furnishings in both the sleeping and small separate lounge area were in good repair and adequate proportionally to the size of the room. The bathroom/closet area was decently sized with a sliding wooden pocket door isolating the bathing and sleeping areas with another door separating the commode and tub/shower combo from the vanity area. A functional small window in the shower wall allowed light in as well as steam out when opened. I love this feature and enjoy it at other older properties like Bill's on the Strip and El Cortez downtown. The water pressure was excellent and the hot water was immediate and profuse with good drainage. A nice, large window provided a partial view of the Strip on the back wall of the lounge area, mounted above an old ventilation system, the controls of which were inoperative and replaced by a digital thermostat on the wall. A safe was oddly mounted to the base of one of two nightstands bedside instead of in the wall. An iron, board, hair dryer and coffeemaker were supplied though cheap, small styrofoam cups replaced mugs. Another nice ammenity is the complimentary shuttle connecting the Orleans and it's sister property, Gold Coast, to Bill's on the Strip. I believe the hotel states a 30 minute wait time but we never waited that long at any of the stops to catch the next shuttle. The drivers are very courteous, efficient and timely making the Strip easily accessible during a wider range of hours than many other properties. Even though the Orleans is off-strip, the shuttle relieves you of the need for a rental car. We would use the shuttle in conjunction with the excellent bus system to reach the Strip and Downtown areas, leaving our car at the hotel so that we could imbibe without the risk of driving. The Prime Rib Loft offers very good fare on par with similar restaurants elsewhere at a lesser cost. We found the buffet merely adequate with a variety of selections but only a few dishes better than average. We didn't try the food court but it is varied and convenient. A good coffee shop exists near the reception entrance. Checkout was quick and the valet personnel very prompt and friendly. A heated outside waiting area with benches was a nice touch on a brisk morning. No property is without it's negatives and the Orleans is no exception. Besides the hazy casino floor, there was a wealth of video poker machines though we found very few with good paytables. In fact, we preferred to take the shuttle to the Gold Coast property to play vp with much better odds. The bartenders were not particularly outgoing but were fairly efficient. The cocktail service on the floor was average to good depending on the hour but the form-fitting uniforms on these attractive ladies were outstanding. We didn't find the prices at the restaurants as attractive for an off-strip property but were reasonable for the most part. Again, we were a bit disappointed by the buffet even though we had player's club discounts as it seemed to have been above average on our last trip. We had the maid barge in on us unannounced while we were in bed at 8:30 am despite our having the Do Not Disturb sign hung outside the door. A simple knock first would have been appropriate. Further, the temperature control for the room was uneven despite the digital thermostat and the old wall unit was a little noisy.

I had asked for a Strip view. We got to our room and saw NO Strip out the window from this 19th room view. Called down to the front desk and when I heard \"If you would like to request a different room press 1\" I became concerned. Do most people ask for a new room? When the front desk gal came on I explained we had asked for a higher floor AND a view of the Strip. She quickly found room 1004 for us. It did have a nice view of the Strip (with the valet parking deck roof AND Deja Vu Adult shop/bar in the view as well.....). This was the second from last room ALL THE WAY at the end of the hall AWAY from the elevator. If you have ever been on a cruise ship and took the elevator to your deck that was at the other end of your hallway, this is the same thing. I am five foot 2 and my husband is just shy of 6 feet. We counted the paces it took us from the bank of elevators to our room. For me it was about 155 steps, for him, 136. If you think this is a walkable distance for you then I highly recommend being as far away from the elevators as possible. The rooms are surrounded by concrete and are almost soundproof EXCEPT the door. You can hear people letting their doors slam (come on people, be courteous. You know the lock mechanism is making the door heavy, hold it until it closes, don't let it slam) and you can hear people in the hallways talking, and I am guessing the elevators dinging at all hours if you are close. If you want quiet get AWAY from the elevators and away from the possibility of people talking/walking past your room! Room was spacious, old tv, great pillows. Tipped the cleaning lady the first day with a $5 bill, she was in the room when we arrived back from shopping and I asked for 2 more pillows and more toiletries daily (we keep them in our house for guests and donate them for the homeless families who stay at our church) and I had TWO sets daily for the remaining nights of our trip! Our room had 2 queen beds and still plenty of room in the rest of the room. Our safe was in the bathroom and BOLTED to the top shelf over the hanging clothes area. Smoke in the casino is there, wish they had a better vent system. No fake perfume smell though which was a plus. We were there on Mardi Gras so we got to see the marching band parade around. Got some great tshirts from the dancing girls with the band and some Mardi Gras beads. It was fun. Played some slots but aren't really into gambling. Had our 7 year old daughter with us and she LOVED the Kids Tyme center. During the week it is $6.50 an hour. Great service, very nice staff, very safe. She had an excellent time each time we dropped her off so we could go to a movie or dinner alone. The breakfast buffet was fine. LONG lines on Tuesdays for breakfast/lunch because the over 50 crowd gets a buy one get one free meal.The line to get in was 45 minutes long at one point. We only ate there for breakfast and enjoyed it. Lots of choices. We ate at TGIFriday's, Baskin Robbins, Fuddruckers all same as at home. We ate at the Prime Rib Loft on our anniversary and dinner was lovely. They gave us a free dessert to share in honor of our anniversary. The last night we were at the Orleans (Thursday the 23rd) a huge crowd of cheerleaders and their parents arrived. The Orleans put up signs on each floor near the elevators (along with a security person on each floor) to try and keep these kids under control. It didn't really work. They were loud, standing in hallways chattering constantly at night, ect. Parents really need to control their kids and know where they are. Letting 10-12 year old girls roam around a casino resort is not a great idea. Took the shuttle to the Strip a few times. It was running about every 20 minutes. We bowled and saw some movies while here. Very nice features to have if you have kids or want something to do besides gamble or sit in smoky areas. My daughter and I did have to take allergy medicine daily to deal with the smoke we breathed in just passing through the casino. We booked through southwestvacations dot com and only had to pay the $6 resort fee daily, the upgrade to a higher level/Strip view was either included in our vacation package or we were given it free when we arrived. I did use the business center for 10 minutes daily for FREE since that internet was quick and included in the resort fee.

We have brought friends here and advised others to stay here as well. We love the large rooms with a coffee maker, in room safe, iron & ironing board., and a large bathroom The beds are fine and linens are fresh and changed as requested as this is a green hotel, which we really like. It's certainly not neccesary to change sheets every night, and towels are changed as needed also. The housekeeping staff are very efficient. We also love the fact that there are security guards at the desk of the elevators, and every guest must have a room key I.D. that you show as you enter. There has never been anyone wandering around the halls, which makes it very safe. The same goes for the casino, lots of staff and all are pleasant. The floor waitresses are very efficient, so don't forget to tip them well. We always rent a car from the airport as we go touring and shopping They have the best valet parking, which is very much appreciated when we come in late or in the summer when it's so hot as the car is in a covered parkade. Again, don't forget to tip well. There are excellent restaurants here with something for everyone, from Coasta Cantina (very good fish platter consisting of 3 varities of fresh fish, YUM, and $1margaritas) to T.G.I F,'s to the French Market Buffet, which has the best All You Can Eat crab on seafood Friday nights !!! And the price is sooooo reasonable.. And again, the wait staff are so busy but always pleasant and attentive!! This reataurant has very good bread pudding and awesome gelato for dessert. Try the raspberry and/or the mango. WOW. The Orleans has a free shuttle to the strip, or the Gold Coast., which is adjacent to The Palms and The Rio Hotels. Great value as it's free.. The pool in the summer is wonderful, free towels poolside, lounge chairs, shade for those that want it and a poolside bar with reasonable prices, not like some!. Again, secured so you need your card to enter, and it's right near the elevators so you don't need to go through the entire hotel to get to it. I think The Orleans has the best Rewards program so remember to sign up for the Be Connected as soon as you get here. Some very good perks as you accumulate points, so make certain to insert your card every time you play as points accumulate quickly and can be used at the Java Coffee shop for a great latte or at the buffet for dinner! And I can't forget to mention they have monthly slot tournaments with money prizes for the top 100 contensants, for the Be Connected members, Yippee. So much fun, we have entered a few times, and what a reception.. Thank You Orleans. And for the over 50 crowd on Tuesdays, you get 7x points, and as soon as you accumulate 50 points you get a chance to spin the wheel for bonus points, free slot dollars, movies, or free gifts. They are very good to seniors ( over 50) And oh yes, 15 minutes of free internet upstairs daily.

The Orleans is consistent though as far as always having a clean and comfortable room, no hassle check in and check out, restaurants on property, and not so jam packed like other casinos. The rooms are a bit outdated but not old or falling apart. We have always had good luck when watching their live lounge acts which presents good music. Go early though because their just isn't enough seats. Everyone has always been friendly here and the rooms always affordable especially during the week. The shuttle drops you off kind of centrally on the strip (Bill's gambling hall which is across from Bally's). So you can walk either way to the other casino's. There inside Bill's is a kiosk called Tix4Tonight. You can purchase discount tickets for most shows for that day. Something to consider. I've done this every time we come and have watched different headlines to comedy/hypnosis shows without problems. Saved money. Tickets for shows will always be higher at the show's box office. The Orleans has a good size theater if you want to kill time during the day or run out of money. Their buffet isn't too bad for the price. Our experience is that we like the buffet at the Rio personally. If you are one who wants to experience the buffet options, buy the buffet of buffet. This will save you money for sure! Generally dinner and brunch on the weekend cost about $29.99. The buffet of buffets cost $44.99 and it is 24 hours for 8 different buffets. Time it to go around 11:00 for brunch then you can have dinner that night and another brunch that next day.

We like live shows, slots, video poker, people watching, tons of walking, good food and lots of laughs. Chose to go from Sat-Wed to beat traffic, lineups and I mean really, $32.00 per night and $6.00 resort fee? I can't stay home for that. Pros: Stayed at over 10 hotels on the strip and nowhere have I had better service. While it's not in the tourist hub, we chose it specifically to be off the beaten path for a change and was not disappointed. Check-in took minutes and the desk is a stone's throw from the front door, as are the guest elevators. Elevator security is evident and while they never once checked my ID, their presence is obvious and appreciated. Guests get free shuttle (throw a $ into the bucket!) to the Strip and also to the Gold Coast Hotel (not recommended!). If it's busy, they want to see your ID to confirm you're a hotel guest. That's a good thing. Check in took minutes, desk is right through the front door, smiles from the staff and felt welcomed right away. Was given many freebies/promotions and we used them all. We don't care about glitzy rooms as we're hardly there. What I do care about is CLEAN and COMFORT. Beds were wonderful, service from the hotel operator was instant and while there's a bit of wear-and-tear, nothing made me gasp. Great shower pressure, loved the little window in the bathroom for fresh air and the maids cleaned the room beautifully. Nice touch of a coffee machine as most middle-of-the road rooms on the Strip are void of those. Guess they want you out of your room as fast as possible to start spending $ but frankly, a room without a coffee pot is enough reason for me not to stay there. Great casino with slots that let you keep playing. Video poker machines at the bars are very worn and could use a bath but still the best place to get a \"real\" drink while you gamble. Floor service was quick and the girls were friendly and attentive. Good piped music -- mostly oldies which suits us fine. Good atmosphere with people having fun. Read lots on here about people getting comp'd for rooms and food and we were no exception. However, this was because we asked to put our gaming points towards anything that was applicable. We spent over $1000 each on gambling and events, so I think comp'ing a $90.00 room and 6 daytime meals should be expected. Wonderful coffee and service in the Java bar with lots of seating for quiet time to enjoy newspaper in the morning. Gift shop stocked well. Movie theatre has great selection of movies and very reasonable prices and fantastic popcorn which a must. In a nutshell, everything about The Orleans was a 10. Except.... Cons: I would have rated this review Excellent if it wasn't for the food. We ate in every establishment except the Prime Rib place, which I heard was very good. The buffet: vegetables were brown and wilted throughout the salad bar and limited to low-end vegetables (no tomatoes?). Beef ribs were impossible to chew through and I mean impossible. Sausage at the breakfast section did not taste like meat, scrambled eggs were watery, hash browns greasy, pastries lacking flavour and seemed very bland. That's just a sample of about 25 things we tried. The Garden Cafe's food was a step up but really, that's not saying much. I had a beef dip and while the roast beef WAS cut off a roast, it was filled with peppercorns and the fat edging left on. Meat for beef dip should be shaved and void of fat. All the fries throughout Vegas seemed to be laden in salt and more salt. Doesn't anybody make real fresh-cut potatoes? Had Sliders at TGIF that are served with such flimsy buns, by the time they got to the table, the bread had disintegrated and it was all mush. And again, salt-laden fries. I would definitely return to the Hotel but would make different dining arrangements. Air cond: (Room on the 16th floor, far end of the hall). The machine is loud and runs intermittently all night long. You can turn it off but it's too hot without it. They do need to upgrade this. I want to be clear, the service throughout the entire establishment is top-notch so my negative comments would only be to the owners who may want to spend 4-5 days in their own establishment and eat all meals there to see what many people are talking about.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "OKC", "Title": "\u201cOur Vegas home\u201d", "Author": "ERock09", "ReviewID": "UR124361253", "Content": "We love The Orleans, we have no complaints.

As in the past we have no complaints whatsoever. One word could sum it up...easy. Easy to get to and out of, easy parking, easy to find a nosh at any hour. The rooms are big , comfortable and have a safe securely bolted to a night table. The bathroom is a bit odd because it has a sliding pocket door that might disturb some guests. And the wardrobe is a part of the set up but is large enough to be manageable. I really like the security check at the elevator bay and have nothing but praise for the housekeeping staff who supplied extra towels, pillows and shampoos with a smile. You have a writing desk for your laptop and a coffee maker that made my hot water for tea in a jiffy. I travel with my own supply of green tea and find it a terrific bonus. This time we did not have a small cooler but many guests have them in tow at check in. The Buffet at the Orleans is very good...plenty to choose from at the salad station and enough in the way of vegetable dishes to accomodate a struggling new vegetarian. I did have a taste of the crawfish ( still struggling ) and absolutely loved them. Plenty of dessert options are sugar-free. Oh happy day ! We love the decor at the Orleans, and the cocktail waitresses in Santa outfits that were charming and not merely seductive. There is an oyster bar that beckoned but we opted for Fudrucker's that actually served a breakfast...cheap and good. We were able to get to Bellagio to check out the Christmas display which was cute but fell short of Martha Stewarts' displays of years past. . Easy in and easy out of the parking and the moving sidewalk is a help when you have lots to carry. We have solved this problem by dropping all the luggage with me at the entrance near the check in desk to wait for my husband to park our rental car and check in. There are movie theatres as well and I believe a bowling alley. We were there just after a rodeo and enjoyed the cowboy element.

This hotel catered to a poportionally large Asian population, and the casino's clientels consisted many local residents. This was one of the few casinos with music or dance shows offered by troupe from Hong Kong or Taiwan, attracting mostly Chinese speaking audiences. The in-casino buffet was inexpensive, but you got what you paid for - a below (Las Vegas) average offering for both breakfast or lunch. Internet access was kind of pricey, considering the number of hours most average Las Vegas visitors would stay in their room using the broadband.

My last visit I stayed at Harrahs just to be on the strip and I hated it there. The Orleans is a really nice hotel. My biggest problem in Vegas is all the smoking (and I have smoked off and on throughout my life), and I felt like Harrahs was disgusting with smoke but I have to say unless I actually walked by someone smoking at The Orleans then I didn't really notice. They do pump in a perfume type smell which can be strong at times but I got used to it and it was better than smoke! The first few employees I encountered were less than pleasant but thankfully it didn't remain that way. Our room was HUGE. My biggest complain was the carpet in the room, it was disgusting!! What a shame too because the room was so nice but the rug definitely needed to be ripped up, there were large blackish stains all over it. But if you get beyond that the room was very nice beyond that. Everywhere else we encountered in the hotel had nice carpets so I'm not sure why our room was so atrocious. Another nice feature of the hotel is the shuttle that takes you the Strip. It ran about every 20 mins so it didn't feel like we waited for a long time, and it was a nice break from the cost of cabs. The food selection at the hotel was great and they also served Starbucks coffee, with free wi-fi at Java Vegas. The hotel also has a bowling alley, arcade and cinema. It was hard to leave the hotel! Overall we had a great experience at The Orleans. I would definitely choose this hotel over any of the older, cheaper ones on the Strip, it's not worth it.

The resort fee includes local phone calls, discounts to some of the on-site restaurants, use of the fitness center and perhaps a few other things I've forgotten about. This hotel is a mile west of the Strip on Tropicana Blvd. at Arville St. There is a free shuttle from the hotel to the Strip and the Gold Coast Hotel but it only runs from 9:30 a.m. to about 9:30 p.m. However there is a public transit bus on Tropicana Ave. (line # 201) that can take you from the strip to the hotel and vice versa in the early morning and until around 1:30 a.m. There is also a bus (line # 104you can take on Arville Rd. which, if going north, takes you to the Las Vegas's Chinatown neighborhood, the Springs Preserve attraction, and Meadows Mall. If going south on this line, you get to the South Strip Transfer Terminal where you can get helpful bus information. The room I had was on the 18th floor and had a great view of the West Las Vegas area. If you want a strip View room let them know at check in, but the West view is nice too where you could see the western mountains. The view was the best part of the room, though, which is fairly dated. The bathroom was okay. There is a 70 lane bowling property on the premises but it is very popular--it seemed nearly full when I visited in the evening hours. There are also movie theaters and a wide variety of restaurants to choose from. I had their regular breakfast buffet and it was an outstanding value for only $7.99. I had superb sweet potato pancakes, blintzes with blueberry topping, delicious chilaquiles with fresh-tasting guacamole, vegetarian beans, grilled vegetables, french toast, fruit, one of the best biscuits I've ever had in my life, and several pastries as well. The sweet potato pancake didn't look like much but it tasted scrumptious and seemed rather healthy. That was one of the two most enjoyable parts of my Las Vegas visit--the other being a visit to the Springs Preserve.

Needing a break and as my wife has never been to Vegas we stayed there again this December. As usual the Orleans is a very busy place with 18 movie theaters, 70 bowling lanes, large hockey arena, many restaurants, etc.. Unknown to us the first week of our stay they were host to the American National Rodeo Championships and extra busy with most patrons being rodeo people. Definite improvements have been made since my last review. Carpets in halls, our room and more importantly the poker room were either new or very well cleaned. The weather was much cooler than anticipated and the heated pool closed on the weekend of the eleventh making the Jacuzzi unavailable. It was even too cool or cloudy to sit outside most days and traveling the strip needed \"layers\" of clothing as it was hot in the sun but very cold out of it. The registration staff were very busy and not up to par from previous trips. Having had to pay $20 per hour for internet use last time I purchased a small laptop and it paid for itself in the two weeks. Free wireless internet in the Java coffee shop was excellent and there was always space available to sit and normally charge your pc. Many hours were spent staying in touch, playing games when bored, etc.. The Courtyard Cafe was well organized and there was always room. The portions were much too big for either of us (Canadians) and probably geared to the american appetite. A major drawback is that it is right next to the sports betting area, open to all the smoke and noise, etc.. We found that if there was a crowd for a game (which seemed to be every evening) to request a seat in the right hand section as far away as possible. We thoroughly enjoyed TG Fridays as there was never a wait and it was all \"glassed in\". The food was good and reasonably priced with excellent service. Al's Oyster bar made great clam chowder. Room service was good and when you put the sign on your door in the am (probably after nine) and came back from breakfast the room was cleaned. As usual the buffet became routine after a few days and many times there was a line up waiting to enter. For the price you will not find anything better. Their Wednesday steak and scampi was great and a bargain. The service was very organized and efficient. Being from Ontario we are used to a \"smoke free\" environment. I doubt that you will find this anywhere in Vegas apart from your room, some closed in restaurants and outside? Having visited the casino / poker rooms in Venetian, Bellagio, etc., the hotels are not designed to provide this atmosphere in most areas. Even areas that indicate \"no smoking\" are full of smoke as they are open to the whole area. My wife and I both allergic to smoke suffered greatly. The Orleans is one of the worst due to large crowds and central location of all bars being part of the casino. The worst was the large one with big screen TV. Cigar smoke was overpowering. We visited both outlet malls (north and south) using the excellent strip bus service for $7 per 24 hours. Either the \"express\" or the Duce run efficiently and by choosing your stops you can change buses with the same pass. The south mall was modern, totally enclosed, contained many brand name stores and good bargains. The north (near Freemont) was very quaint, all outside (at 50f quite chilly) and not as many stores. There are many superb malls on the strip and you should not miss Planet Hollywood or Caesars Forum and the Venetian. Very expensive but amazing to see. My only real concern with the Orleans staff was that in August I booked an all inclusive package (flight and hotel). My main game is poker and they offer a \"poker rate\" for rooms. When I went to claim it the poker room approved but the front desk would not as they said I had not booked the hotel \"separately\" but through a package. This time in checking all web prices I found that I could save about $100 (through Expedia) over booking both separately but the \"poker rate\" would make up that difference and I would be ahead by about $50 so I booked separate flight and the room through the Orleans even mentioning the poker rate of 20% being deducted at the end of our stay. Early in our stay I approached a poker manager who called the front desk and said there might still be a problem. The day before leaving I again approached the poker manager to get his approval, when he called the front desk they once again declined. I then went to the front desk manager and explained the situation, that they had told me the rules, I had played the hours and booked the hotel separately and through their phone line, it was being refused. After looking at his computer, a lengthy argument he still refused giving me a song and dance that \"I was already at their lowest rate for most days\". It does annoy me that such a large hotel would stiff me for $100 after I followed the rules given to me by them. Nothing to do with the money, they set the standard and should follow it. The moral, if you have an option, book through the cheapest internet site that you can find for the package of flight and room. General comment, Vegas was much colder than expected for December so bring may layers of clothes at this time of year and until April or May. If you are at all sensitive to smoke Vegas is not the place to be. There are no real \"no smoking\" regulations and most areas that are supposed to be smoke free are open to the whole area and polluted. Casino's especially are very unsanitary. Both my wife and I came home with serious head, chest and throat infections. Waitresses take no care in keeping the drinking surface of any drink \"clean\" and normally put them down holding by the top with all five fingers. They serve a drink then take chips or money from customers and then serve the next drink spreading many germs. Hey, you go to Subway and they put on plastic gloves, their hands never touch your food so there is never any problem. I use hand sanitizer most often and after leaving any game or room but never thought about what was happening until I got sick after a few days. Casino chips are deadly for the spread of flue, colds, etc., as they are never cleaned and handled by many people. For those who have never been to Vegas another annoyance is the fact that it is so dry that your nose can end up bleeding winter and summer. Try over the counter nose sprays, a little vasaline in each nostril and running your head under a hot shower to breath in the moisture a couple of times per day. Enjoy but do some planning before going.

They have reasonable weekend prices and a very low $6 resort fee. I ran into a problem checking in because I didn't have the card I booked with online. I know this is needed, but I flew in from N.C. and was delayed almost 8 hours so I left the airport to fill up my car with gas. I left the card in my car. I informed the young lady while I was checking in and she said \"they are very strict about this\" yada yada yada. I ended up having to get my friend who was booked in another room to secure my room with her credit card which I felt was unnecessary. I did have my check book with me, I'd stayed there before, I just felt they had no flexibility. They don't take checks. She did waive the 6 resort fee, which was never the problem in the first place. The 15 a day food credit is convenient, I could not tell where they had deducted it when I checked out though, so we went 12 rounds about that. The free shuttle to the strip is nice, runs to midnight and puts you off at a sister property near the middle of the strip. I didn't use the spa this time but remember it being really nice, if I stay there again I will use it. They also have a bowling alley and movie theater on site, as well as 24 hour TGI Fridays and a Fuddruckers, which was pretty good, and a good Mexican restaurant we had one night. The king sized non smoking room was very nice with a flat screen, sitting area, and large bathroom. Also, single serve coffee in the room. Checking out was a pain in the neck, the woman who waited on me did not know what she was doing and did not waive the 6 fee as I told her the manager told me she would upon checking in, I spent about 30 minutes working with her to figure it out.

We paid so little that I was concerned about what we'd find. But there was nothing cheap about the rooms, service, or \"look\" of the casino. Although I've never been to New Orleans, it kind of felt like a classy New Orleans. I noticed that the music played was country western. I thought, this is not New Orleans music. But we were in Vegas during some huge national rodeo thing. There were cowboy hats everywhere, so I'm guessing they were playing country western music for those attendees. The casino noise also wasn't as obnoxious as it can often get...the volume on the machines or something. There were smokers, and I hate smoke, but the air systems seemed pretty decent at sucking it up. I could not detect smoke in the hotel section. We were traveling as a couple with a mother-in-law. We booked under one name, so they upgraded us (free) to a two bedroom suite on the 21st floor! Now if you don't like your MIL maybe that would be bad, but the suite was very nice. All of the furnishings were very nice. There was a private bathroom for each bedroom. It had a huge wet bar area with a fridge, a living room with ample seating, and there were six flatscreen TVs in the three room suite. If you are traveling with a group, this would be the room to host the private party in. The bed was very comfortable, we slept well. We had dinner in the Courtyard Cafe. There was a distinct difference between the water/table folks and the waitresses. The water folks were on top of it, fast service. The waitress...not so much. The food though, once it arrived, was worth the wait. We had BBQ baby back ribs. We split the plate and we left full. The ribs were excellent, the cajun fries were v.g. and the steamed veggies were v.g, not a pile of mush. My MIL ordered a fruit plate. It was a warm muffin, cottage cheese and a HUGE plate of fresh fruit. We had a container of leftover fruit that we put in the fridge. It was definitely a place I'd eat at again. We were only making a pit stop on the way down to Lake Havasu City, so we didn't have time to partake of all the hotel has to offer. But I will definitely keep The Orleans on our radar for our next trip.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barrington, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Orleans\u201d", "Author": "Dorothy M", "ReviewID": "UR121829802", "Content": "We travel to Vegas 2-3 times each year and always stay at The Orleans.

However, I have to consider the hotel from several perspectives... Rooms...The tower rooms are quite nice for the price and have nice marble counters, full-length mirrors, comfy bed, oversized pillows, and a very tasteful New Orleans-ish decor. Their \"scam\" (as I call it) resort fee is only $6 a day which is not too bad, considering what many of the Vegas hotels bilk their guests for. I just got back and this is the FIRST time ever that I received a Strip view and it was very nice and I did appreciate it. The registration desk employees have always been top-notch, friendly, and have always let me check in early (before 10am) if a room was available. I have to commend the hotel for their registration desk. I still had a tube-type TV, which had pretty bad resolution...I would've expected a flat-screen these days, but there were enough channels to keep me satisfied. I criticized the hotel previously for their simply horrible cocktail waitresses and keno staff who seemed to have a grudge against customers. I have seen *some* improvement. At least a few of the keno staff and cocktail waitresses were friendly to me, though it still wasn't on par with what I would expect from a service industry, especially in the locals market. Hello? I won $320 in keno can the keno cashier at LEAST say congratulations? I didn't tip her a thing because she was so smug about paying me. However, after observing many of the cocktail waitresses, I think their interactions are a bit better than before; however, I still saw several cocktail waitresses who never smiled and said \"thank you\" after a tip without even looking at customers. There was one standout waitress in the keno lounge whose name I didn't catch but she was a hit with everyone there. This was on 12/15 around 7pm. SHE knew how to be friendly and make people feel welcome As for gambling, and I am a video poker player...The Orleans has fallen off the radar in the last few years. In the 5 cent to 25 cent range, there are very few machines that tip the 99% return mark and most machines I observed were at the 94.7% payback range. Pretty horrible for a \"locals casino\"...I counted over THIRTY 100%+ payback machines at the Fiesta Henderson. The only grudge I have against the hotel rooms is that the doors close LOUDLY and I mean they SLAM. So if you are sensitive to noise, please consider somewhere else. I sleep with earplugs, but even in the afternoons when I was just watching TV it was SLAM, SLAM, SLAM every few minutes. Surely the hotel can do something about the damping on the doors? If you're a tourist then understand that this casino is geared towards locals and so you're going to find ALOT of smoke, perhaps alot of drinking, and maybe not the tourist trade you're accustomed to on the Strip. Unfortunately, you'll also find alot of local families who just let their children run wild and scream throughout the casino and restaurants. However, if you use a rental car (as I do), you'll find that the hotel is conveniently located to the Strip, airport, a quick hop-jump to downtown, and a bit longer drive to the Boulder/Henderson casinos. Would I stay here again? I think this was my last time. Due to their horrific video poker payback schedules, I think it's time to move on. I love the rooms, but I can simply stay in other hotels with MANY 100% payback video poker machines (Fiesta, Station Casinos) and not have to travel at all. I won't even get into the slot machines if you're a slot player. As with all the penny machines these days...they are dismal and volatile and, unless you get some sort of bonus round, your $20 is gone in less than five minutes. I play slots for about 1/2 hour when arrive and then I'm done. Maybe others can speak in more detail, but the machines here are terrible.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melrose, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cEasy Access To Western Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "41673Jewells539", "ReviewID": "UR121775442", "Content": "Visited over Labor Day.

We all had a fun-filled vacation, with the Orleans being the last hotel everyone came to meet up at to say our final goodbyes before heading back home. All 30 of us had a wonderful time there since we all have different tastes when it comes to gambling, food and just enjoying the amenities that this property had to offer. We didn't all eat together, with some doing TGIF, some enjoying the food court, Al's Oyster Bar or whatever fancied one's palate at the moment. Some took the time out between gambling to take in a movie or two during our stay, while others couldn't be pulled away from those table or slot machines at any cost. The rooms were more than adequate along with being spacious, clean and most of all comfortable, when it comes to the bedding. We were on the 11th floor and had a beautiful view when it came to looking out towards the city night lights. You can't beat the value for your money if you had to pay, but for us, these were comp rooms for all. One thing I've always enjoyed about the Orleans, is its spacious casino with the high ceilings and well thought out casino floor plan. You never feel like you're cramped in like you do in some smaller hotel casinos, and yet, its not overwhelming like those mega resorts where you just can't find each other or where you find yourself walking for days on end. The aisle for foot traffic is wide enough to accommodate their many patrons, and quite accessible & comfortable enough to maneuver around for those who may need to use a motorized chair which is also offered by the hotel for a reasonable price. Orleans employees are very friendly, courteous and professional, beginning with the valet, bell desk, front desk, table games, slot hosts and all the way up to the back of the house personnel such as the housekeeping staff. And now, for the main thing we came for, the gambling here....AWESOME! The variety and newness of slot machines were endless, along with the various table games that the Orleans offered, made this a hotel that we ALL enjoyed. Another important thing I need to mention here is not forgetting to pick up your Bconnected card which can be used at all Boyd's and Coast hotel casinos. You have to remember that this card is what helps you to earn comps, freebies and discounts where points can be used for dining too. I don't know if it was because we were coming to the end of our stay after being here from 11/11/11 and leaving 11/17/11 where many people had just finish dumping a lot of money into those machines, but I gotta say this, each one of us were very lucky on these machines, whether one played a poker machine, or one of those exotic penny machines, the Craps table, Pai Gow table or whatever it may be. We all at one point or another were happy with our winnings at the Orleans. Although this hotel is somewhat located about two minutes away from the strip, they do offer a shuttle to venture to its sister property the \"Gold Coast Hotel & Casino\" another nice hotel to stay at. The best thing I can say at this time is this entire trip ended with a lot of happy relatives going home with some big wide smiles and some winnings too! Again, we had a wonderful stay at the Orleans and guess what, we'll be back for Super Bowl 2012 and are looking forward to seeing all those friendly staff who have helped make our Vegas & \"Orleans\" experience such a memorable one!

This trip, my husband found the Orleans. We ended up getting a 4 day package deal which included airfare and hotel. I was feeling a bit odd about being a mile off the strip and knew it would not be walking distance. I also was concerned that it would be a rundown dive. Boy was I surprised. It is off the strip on Tropicana, but it was fantastic. It is large, well maintained. No old cigarette smells. The staff were all friendly. We had absolutely no wait to check in. The room was large with a king bed, couch, desk, chair and flat screen TV. We did not have a view of anything other then the parking lot but I found out later that if you ask for a strip view, it can be arranged. The pool area was large with 2 pools and hot tub. Nice lounge chairs with plenty of space for personal privacy. An outdoor bar with fair prices. The casino was so much fun. They have every game possible and the cocktails waitresses were attentive. The crowd was mostly older folks. We are mid 50's and I felt like one of the youngest. This in no way took away from my fun. I would not recommend this for younger people because there really is no \"nightclub\" scene. Several great restaraunts, a movie theatre and a bowling alley are part of this complex. They even offer a free shuttle bus that goes to the strip every half hour from 9 am until 1230 am. It continues to make rounds between Bills Gambling hall on the strip (next to Bally's), The Gold coast (next to the Rio)-which was a fun stop and back to the Orleans. I would definitely stay here again. I really liked the fact that I could go to the strip and get all the noise and excitement and then return to the Orleans where the casino itself seemed quieter. There were always crowds of people but I think the machines make less \"bing, bang, boom\" noises. Anyway I had a great trip and did not get a headache from the noise.

My husband and some friends were meeting me the next day for the weekend (so more TR to come). Had a ruby card so I got the room for $30. The Orleans charges a 6 dollar resort fee which I didn't think was a big deal. I arrived at about 10:30am from Miami and a bit tired. I just wanted to put my things in the room and relax a bit. I thought there is no way they have the room ready that early, but faced a 2 minute wait to be given my keys within 5 minutes. It took longer to get to the room than check in for me. The room - the room is a basic hotel room. It is clean which is extremely important. I didn't see stains on the carpet but the hallways are worn and very peachy if that matters to you. It is a bed, a sofa and a TV and a bathroom. The bathroom had a tub/shower combo with basic amenities, again clean. I read on other reports about the closet in the bathroom. I was still surprised to see it. So weird to have your hanging closet in the bathroom, but I was there for 1 night and it didn't much matter to me. The bed wasn't a pillowy bed, but I did manage to be able to sleep. It was cold at night and I so wished there was a blanket on the bed (it only had a piece of blue fabric at the foot of the bed). I had gambled all day and was too tired to call down for one which would have easily fixed that situation. But hey for $30 bucks it was a definite deal! The service - I have to say with the exception of one even in the Coasta Cantina Restaurant (reason for 4 not 5 rating), I was really impressed with the personnel at the Orleans. They were down home friendly and made you feel welcome. The check in and check out, the slot attendants, the housekeeping staff, the security guards and the staff at Koji were so nice. It was my first time there so they took the time to tell me about their property and help me find things (it's a big casino). I thought that said a great deal of good about the staff as a whole and considering I was alone, that made a world of difference to me. Restaurants - I went to Koji for lunch and Coasta Cantina for dinner. Koji was great service and food. I had my favorite, a wonton noodle soup and it was one of the best I had. The staff were very nice. The Coasta Cantina had really good food. I had a peach margarita that was very tasty and this trio of dips with chips that was the best I ever had. You can get full just on that! But of course I ate more. I got the chicken burrito. It was really great. My only negative comment is the waitress, although attentive at the beginning, forgot about my food delivery. I sat there while others came after me, ate and left. The hostess was clueless even though I was practically in front of her. I finally flag another person down and said a burrito should not take that long. Of course they don't but the order was definitely lost or forgotten. She was handling so many big tables I think I was just lost in the shuffle. But if you like Mexican and Chinese these two restaurants were affordable and definitely do overs. I would go back! The gambling - I played some video poker and slots. Things weren't going well at the penny or dollar. These machines are a bit tight. Not one big win unfortunately. Palace Station - I decided after lunch to go to check out another Casino I have never been to, Palace Station. A $10 taxi. The minute I walked in, I wanted to turn around and walk out. I really didn't like the vibe in this Casino. The clientele were different from Orleans. Orleans seemed to have more laid back patrons, I liked that. The Palace Station felt like I had to hold my purse for dear life. I played about 20 minutes, couldn't stand it any more and jumped in a cab to the Palms. The Palms - boy was this a mistake. Just a comment. I went to about 10 casinos on this trip at least. The Palms is the only one that gave me drinks in a cheezy 4 oz plastic cup. NOT impressive. The machines were tighter than you can imagine. I was going to eat at the mexican restaurant here but they ignored me so I decided, that's it and went back to Orleans. Back at Orleans - I ate the great Mexican meal mentioned above and played a bit more. Then off to bed. In all the Orleans was friendly, good food at the two restaurants. Check in was friendly, slot attendants were really nice. Room was fine for $30 dollars. Had a good latte at the Java Vegas and off to the Bellagio.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amawalk, New York", "Title": "\u201cGood value for the money\u201d", "Author": "amawalkbw", "ReviewID": "UR120181129", "Content": "We decided on the Orleans given the price was VERY reasonable and the reviews on Travel Advisor seemed to be more favorable overall.

They gave us a great spot on the 19th floor which had a nice view of the strip. There are plenty of places to eat inside but the French Buffet restaurant was a great deal for both breakfast and dinner so we hit that a few times (though I saw some good deals at TGI Friday's as well). Walking through the casino you did pick up a bit of smokiness which was not overpowering but was still there whenever you came through. I liked the that there were plenty of penny, nickel, and quarter slots and video games for my wife to learn how to play and only lose $10 over an hour or two. I liked that they had $5 roulette which I milked $100 for a good hour and walked away even. The bus to the strip was not so bad a wait either. We took that in one night and had no issue getting on coming or going (but we were there mid-week, so I'm not sure about the weekend) My only gripe like many others is terrible internet connectivity (and paying $10 for it !)

Well it's now 8:30 and not one of the 5 members of this band felt it necessary to simply walk up to their mic and announce that they will start playing after the game is over (which turned out to be past 10pm). It was apparent the bar told the band to hold off until the game was over, but is it so hard to let the people in the bar who some gave a night up in Vegas to listen to you the plan of action? Being a total Beatles fan and musician the question may be \"was it worth the wait?\" Oh wait, this is an Orleans Hotel/Casino review. This band represented themselves and not the Orleans.

Came back 10 minutes later especially to avoid her and got everything taken care of by another staff member. A couple of the bartenders and one guy at the Sportsbook here were crotchety and unpleasant. Though mainly the staff was okay. There is a food court with Subway, Sbarro, etc. which was good when you needed it and a very good sushi restaurant as well. For me, the best feature of this hotel was the free wi-fi at the Java Vegas cafe. It did cost $6.00 per night (part of your resort fee) but I enjoyed taking my laptop downstairs and surfing whenever I needed to check e-mail, browse etc. All things considered, I probably would stay at the Orleans again because of their great room rates, the free wi-fi at Java Vegas and the convenience of the shuttle bus service to the strip. A couple of isolated bad customer service incidents are probably unavoidable in Vegas these days (unfortunate but true) although these incidents and the somewhat worn out rooms keep the Orleans in the category of just a decent hotel with great value.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Cruces, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGreat lodging value, convenient parking, casino showing it's age.\u201d", "Author": "Beenel", "ReviewID": "UR119842558", "Content": "Room and service were great, convenient parking made it easy to go elsewhere for entertainment.

Even though the room was located in the original building (not the new building) it was in good shape.

I knew this hotel was not going to be anything near the luxury or quality of Red Rock or TI.. but still they need to catch up with the times . For this particular trip , I was attending the Mr Olympia which the Orleans was the Host Hotel for this event. Here are my pros about the hotel- friendly and helpful staff, fast check in and we arrived at noon and was given our room early, drinks at the bars were affordable had a blast at the Alligator bar, the food was affordable, and I will say I did not have a bad meal while staying there, from Room service breakfasts to TGI Fridays ..to the 24 hour cafe .. food was very good and reasonably priced. The gift shop was chock full of snacks and drinks , and had a wide variety of souveniers and gifts . The rooms are quite large with plenty of counter space ( watch out for the large crystal grandma lamp on the night stand ... not only does it take up the entire table top space .. but it is nailed down too... classy huh ?) The fitness center is modern ( more modern than the hotel itself..) and well equipped with plenty of cardio machines, and even a stepmill.. and freeweights that go up to 50 lbs . I did not have time to swim in the pool, but from what I did see, the pool seemed to be mostly covered by the shade of the hotel building blocking the sun. .. and the lounge chairs looked like they had seen better days. OK.. here are the cons- the hotel is in dire need of an entire room renovation. The carpets were stained , and dusty, and even smelled musty. The wood paneled doors give off that seedy 70's roadside Adirondack motor lodge vibe. The bath tub was a disgrace. mildew and mold and in need of caulking. The gold plated bath fixtures all tarnished. We had a king room, and was only supplied with 2 flat pillows . The sheets were scratchy and the brass headboard totally tarnished. housekeeping only leaves 2 thin bath towels daily.. so one morning I showered and also used a towel to dry my hair,, and my husband was left to drip dry and blot himself with a dry hand towel. ( the next day we asked housekeeping for extra towels and they did leave 4 of them ) I don't watch much TV when I travel, but this hotel still has those big box television sets. Yet we found out that our friends who had a room on the 19th floor had a flat panel TV.. ( and a freshly tiled bathroom.. but the rest of their room was not updated at all..what gives ? ) My first night I slept in the bed and refused to use the blankets or sheets .. and laid a t shirt on the pillow before putting my head on it. I kept feeling imaginary little itchy bugs biting my body while laying in that bed. It drove me nuts.. by day 3 I managed to talk myself into roughing it and just sucked it up and used the blanket. I really hope the Mr Olympia convention chooses a more classy and up to date hotel for next year, because many of us attendee's like staying in the hub of things at the host hotel.. but not many of us are Orleans Caliber. on the other hand myself and the group of 10 we traveled with would stay if they renovated the place.

The restaurants are plentiful and you have many choices. We get deals constantly from the hotel. Their perks are great. We have at least 2 nights free every month. Needless to say we don't go that often but it's a great weekend get-away & inexpensive (except for gambling). The only drawback to the Orleans, that we see, is that it is off the strip. But since there is a shuttle that leave every 15-20 minutes, it has never been a big issue. There are quite a few hotels off the strip (Rio, Palms & a few others) and it is nice to have a quieter casino sometimes. The reason we like the Orleans when we have the kids with us, (ours 18 & 20 and the High School baseball team), is that the hotel has many things for them to do. There is a 70+ lane bowling alley, 16 movie theaters & an arcade. There is even a little kids area with bounce houses, etc. The pool area is large & had a poolside bar with friendly bartenders.

Restaurants available are the French Market Buffet (we had the Sunday brunch, it was ok, but there are better options elsewhere), a Mexican food restaurant (with a to go option), a 24 hour cafe, TGI Fridays (24 hr), Fudruckers (24 hr), Sbarro, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Baskin Robbins, an Irish Pub, and probably more.

I shopped around for prices and took the Expedia offer which was a bargain. Check in was quick but the King Smoking room that I had requested was not available the first night so we had a King Non-Smoking on the 7th floor for that night. It was at the end of a very long corridor but we were very happy with the room. Good sized, coffee machine, flat screen TV, and very clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. There was a sliding door to the bathroom and the hanging space for clothes was in there too (very similar to the rooms at Bills). So far so good. The next day we were moved to a King Smoking room on the 17th floor, this time at the end of a not so long corridor. This room was even better - it seemed more spacious again and the bathroom was bigger too and there was a coffee machine and flat screen TV. Again the room was immaculate. There were only 2 pillows on the bed so I requested more and they arrived very quickly. I was extremely impressed when I got a call from housekeeping to make sure that we were happy with everything! Again the bed was very very comfortable. The daily maid service was very thorough and the room and bathroom were always spotless. The casino was great, plenty of machines, no smokey atmosphere, and everything looked bright and clean. There were always staff sweeping, wiping machines, cleaning ashtrays and removing empty glasses etc. We signed up for our Bconnected cards and earned lots of extra points by swiping the cards at one of the machines on 'senior' day. The overall points earned gave us comped meals and free points play on the slots. There are a variety of eating places but our favourite was the French Market Buffet for the buffet breakfast. I think this was 7.99 on a weekday but you got a $1 discount on production of the Bconnected card. The food there was really good and there was an vast choice. Tremendous value for money. We also used the Java coffee shop one day for a quick light breakfast but that cost as much, if not more than the buffet so only did it the once. We used the shuttle to travel onto the Strip and to the Gold Coast and also walked across the car park to visit McMullens pub one day.

Was looking for a bargain priced property and ended up wishing I had just gone to Motel 6. This place is really, really OLD. The room was on the 19th floor. The brass bed headboard railing was attached to the wall with string! Apparently that was to keep it from squeaking too much. If so, it didn't work. The furniture is circa 1970's. As was the TV, which you cannot see while sitting on the sofa. I was surprised the remote actually worked. The bathtub looked like something you would expect to find in a small town Best Western that had not been updated in thirty years. Towels were standard K-mart variety, rough to the touch. The noise up and down the hall and from adjoining rooms kept me from going to sleep until past 2 pm. It is not a sound-proofed building by any means. The casino itself is extremely smoky - worst in Vegas to the best of my knowledge. It's a place frequented by locals and out of towners who don't know any better. They do not have a neat selection of slots at all. It's almost as if they do not want to spend the money upgrading anything, even slots. Poker room was - interesting. Lots of locals who play very bad. But again, the smoke was everywhere. Even though the poker room itself is non-smoking, it drifts in and is so thick that you'd swear the entire poker room was smoking. Given the isolated location, you would think they would curtail all smoking in the corridors leading to the poker room - that would help a lot but it would tick off their regulars who love to \"step outside\" for a smoke, which to them means just across the rail. Really kind of lame. They should just call it a smoking poker room and get on with it and let everyone who wants to smoke at the table do so. They do have some good quality, good value places to eat on the property including Sbarro's, Basking Robbins, etc. There is a pub on property that is cool with a band that starts at 8pm. The buffet is not bad, but for breakfast it does not open until 8 am. Seriously. Maybe they don't know they're in Vegas?? They have a $6 resort fee which seems cheap enough until you realize that you don't get anything for it. Free wi-fi in the coffee shop area is very good but it costs a fortune in the room. Overall, I cannot give this property a score higher than a 2, which is the lowest rating I've given any property in Vegas to date. If you're familar with infamous \"downtown\" Vegas properties, then you'll appreciate it when I say this property IS a downtown property, located in the Southwest part of town (about 2 miles west of the Strip on Tropicana). If you're staying here for the dollar value, my advice is to spend a few extra bucks and get a hotel with a better experience. And if you're coming here for any other reason - WHY??", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago Suburb, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, Family atmosphere\u201d", "Author": "KathyfromChicago", "ReviewID": "UR117568640", "Content": "My huband and I stayed at the Orleans at the end of June for our 16th wedding anniversary.

We were there with another couple, who requested a standard room. I reserved an assessable room. When we arrived the assessable room was ready, but the other couple were told to come back in two hours or so. We decided to have a cocktail before lunch and stopped at the Alligator Bar where we were completely ignored for five minutes or longer. Finally a bartender came by and told us it would be a couple more minutes because they were having a shift change. Not very good scheduling, someone should always be available to serve the customers. After lunch the other couple went to get the keys to their room. When they got to the room they found nothing but a big mess, unmade bed, beer bottles all around. They went back down to the front desk and were told they would have to wait and come back later. We then went out to the pool to relax for a while.

There is no restaurant at the pool, just a snack bar and a small bar for cocktail service.

We have been staying there for at least the past 7 years now and I think they are doing a good job of keeping things up. Our room was typically well cared for and clean, with the safe in the room and all it is very convenient. We stayed on the 5th floor in the tower reached from the elevators closer to the pool. There were a couple of stains on the carpet, but no big deal. We really like to stay there because we often have our car with us- but we have used the shuttle and then the Deuce bus to navigate the strip when we've flown with little problem. We each find things we enjoy in the casino- my husband the lower stakes Texas Hold Em tables and I like their slots. I do miss some of the ones they seem to have fazed out over the past year- the Twilight Zone and Jaws seem to have left the planet! But they also have added new ones. Things I am learning not to take for granted: Check-in is usually very fast (less than 10-15 minutes) at any time of the day we have arrived. When we are in the bigger casinos on the strip there always seem to be backups at all hours of the day, with people sitting around on their luggage waiting. Security of having someone looking for room keys. The care they take with keeping the hallways up- we wandered around the Luxor because we were curious about it. No one looked for our key and we went all over the place. What a dismal place! The hallways were dismal, dark, in dire need of cleaning and paint, with pieces of the wall torn off at points- like one too many \"hangover\" type bachelor parties have occurred there or something. My one complaint: - we enjoy the buffet and it is very reasonably priced. We tend to get the same things over and over and so it is ok. But I think that it has become a bit boring and some of the dishes were not as hot as I would like. They could use a little more variety.

I don't remember what we paid per night, but it totaled about $200 for all three nights. - The room was huge. The bed was huge. There was a phone in the bathroom. There was a bathtub - I LOVE having bathtubs while on a trip. - Free shuttle to the Strip. (It's not far, so a cab could be reasonable, too) - I didn't use the pool, but had a perfect view from my room. It looked really nice, spacious, with some chairs and grassy areas. Looked clean, too. - Bowling alley! - There is a convenience store type place with some souvenirs and giant cans of beer, and a liquor store. - Decent drink prices. - We didn't have a car, but there is a huge parking lot. Things I didn't like: - The main floor especially was incredibly smokey. I'm a non-smoker, and after about a day in the hotel my throat started to hurt pretty badly and feel kind of inflamed. We were walking around some other hotels on the Strip and they seemed WAY better ventilated - I could hardly notice the smoke in some of them. The Orleans should really try to improve on this somehow. It was disgusting. - The front desk person upon check-in: She was polite, but she didn't give us any information other than our room number. It would have been nice if she told us about the dining options, how to get to different places (pool, bowling alley, movie theatre, etc.), internet, etc. I'd never been to that hotel before, how was I supposed to know? - Cell reception in most areas of the hotel (for calls and texts) was terrible. Really inconvenient if you're meeting up with people, etc. - Some jerks down the hall from us decided to hang out with their door open when we were trying to sleep, talking really loudly. I was just kind of surprised at just how loud it sounded in our room. I mean, they were a few doors down and it sounded like they were standing on our bed. - $12.99 a day for spotty wi-fi. We ate at the Mexican restaurant a couple of times, which was pretty decent. I think sub-par Mexican in the SW USA is still better than \"good\" Mexican food in Northern Alberta. We decided to have breakfast at Fuddrucker's for about $8 each rather than getting the $14.99 buffet. I still can't get over how much butter they gave us for one slice of bread, but it was alright. The food court also had a Subway and Sbarro, and there were a couple of other restaurants we didn't try. I don't gamble, so I don't know if the selection of games and machines was good or not.

We were assigned a room with two queen beds instead of a single king bed, like I'd requested, but oh well. The room itself was pretty good. I think the wall thermostat was in someways just a facade. The temperature could be turned down as low as 62, in our room at least, but still didn't feel any cooler than it did at 68 degrees. The room initially did have some odors of body odor and cigarette smoke. A few sprays of Febreeze every day helped out. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom door was quite heavy, so we weren't worried about sounds traveling (as some other reviews stated), but could be hard to move back and forth. The slots were extremely tight. We mainly played the penny slots, with some nickel and quarter slots interspersed. We weren't impressed with the slots. I saw a lot more choices for the different penny slots at other casinos on the Strip. The shuttle did run every 15 minutes and was very handy and greatly appreciated. We tried to eat at the buffet a couple of times, but got discouraged after standing in line for over 15 minutes and still not being at the register. A big hang-up with the buffet is that after you pay for your meals at the register, you then have to stand and wait to be seated, instead of seating yourself. We did eat at the TGIFriday's in the hotel and found the food to be on the same level as a TGIFriday outside a hotel, but our server was quite lacking in his customer service. We never saw a manager or had one come by to check on how our meals were. The Japanese place- the food was good but quite expensive, even for a sushi place.

Good location off the strip but watch out for the free shuttle in as the last one leaves at 12:30pm and there is only one with about 40 seats NO standing allowed which means they only ever assume 40 people are going to catch the last shuttle back to the hotel which is crazy!

We hadn't been to Vegas in 11 years and decided to go at the last minute as I had a granddaughter who was going to be in a cheerleading competition at the Orleans Arena. Check in was a breeze but nothing about the hotel or the casino made you feel like you were in Las Vegas. The rooms were large but only average accomodations. The first morning there, we were pleased with the prompness of the housekeeping staff to get our room cleaned as soon as we left for breakfast at about 9am. The next day was a different story; It was 4pm before we got any kind of maid service at all and I had to call housekeeping to get it cleaned and to get fresh linens. Nothing turns me off more than not having my room cleaned after spending most of the day gone and coming back to an unmade bed! The hotel did offer a good variety in restaurants and bars. Anything from seafood to steaks to hamburgers. There was even a TGI Friday's inside the hotel. Drink prices were reasonable at all of the bars but finding a bartender with a personality was rare if not any. It's nice to sit at the bar and chit chat with the bartender but that didn't happen anywhere in the whole hotel. The waitstaff was far and few between...I guess we weren't tipping enough. Gaming was OK if you stuck to penny machines. Stay away from quarters and dollar slots! They didn't hit at all. I expected to have the slots loosened since we weren't gambling on the strip. I'm not sure that I, as a travel agent, would recommend this hotel to anyone but people traveling with children. I recommend paying a little more and staying on the strip if you're making the trip out to Vegas.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth, Texas", "Title": "\u201cOverun with Basketball Players and Little Security Intervention\u201d", "Author": "Vegas022", "ReviewID": "UR116117761", "Content": "Recently returned from the Orleans Hotel in Vegas.

Noisy, frenetic etc. This time I wanted a resort type hotel with a bit of quiet. The Orleans fit the bill perfectly. Staff were very friendly, from the check in desk to the maids to the security chaps and so on. I arrived late on Sunday and checked in straight away. Received a set of coupons for onsite eateries and so on. My room was a double queen, I had asked not to be far from the elevator and this was the case. Whilst I visited there was a basketball meet of some kind (huge and polite teenage boys everywhere) and an athletics meet. Neither of these were any kind of problem. The Orleans seems to have a very clear and fair policy regarding the behaviour that is expected of attendees at these events and it all seemed good to me. I was on a non smoking floor and my room did indeed seem smoke free. The carpet had seen better days, but the room was clean and comfortable. The bed was heaven, and as I came down with a nasty cold on the plane to Las Vegas I spent way too much time in the bed - I really appreciated it's comfort! The TV was an old 'box' type but had enough channels to keep my busy whilst blowing my nose. Bathroom was well fitted out with a lovely shower plus iron and ironing board in the room, as well as a small hairdryer and nice toiletries. I ate at the TFI Fridays, the Fudruckers, the Sbarro and the Buffet. The first three all did exactly what you would expect from each of these outlets. Solid, reliable fare. The Buffet is cheap - $7.99 for breakfast, $8.99 for lunch (sign up for players club and get a $1 discount). The food is not special but it is hot, plentiful and solid. Nice range of cakes!! Because of being ill I did not take advantage of the pool or the cinema but the range of movies was excellent with lots of showings. Maid service was very good. I was not out of my room much yet every time I made it out for an hour or so, when I came back the room was done. Bless you ladies. The shuttle to the strip apparently tuns every 30 minutes, but I never waited more than about ten, if that. Very convenient and drops you right in the centre at Bill's. I also used shuttle transport to and from the airport - a bargain at $8.50 each way. I also used the taxis from outside the hotel - I never felt like I was being taken the long way round which is always helpful. Free internet at the coffee bar and also ten minutes per day in the business centre if you don't have your own laptop with you. All in all a successful stay and I would definitely stay at the Orleans again.

While there participants in a very large nation wide beauty contest, a hockey tournament, a bowling tournament and martial arts training were encountered. It is a very family oriented place. Our stay of 16 days was great. Overall their staff were well informed and friendly. The buffet was excellent and very reasonably priced but did not open until 8 am and then a normal 20 minute wait in line to eat. There are also many other eateries and bars including Subway, TG Fridays, and an Oyster bar. It is located in a pleasant business area with Wallgreens, Dennys, Bank of America, and other convenience stores within a short walking distance (not sure about after dark). The hotel is clean but does need some restorations, carpets in our room on the 17th floor, the hallways and especially the Poker room were badly stained. The room was very quiet. The pool (really needed as the temperature varied between 105 and 110f) was very clean, not at all crowded and there was always an adequate supply of lounges and towels. The only drawback is that it is located between two 20 story buildings (at this time of year?) and the first ray of sun anywhere appeared at 9:30 am and it took until 10:30 for roughly 1/3 of the area to be in the sun. For those interested, the Poker room, while a little crowded, is very well run and holds both live and tournament games daily. The staff (especially Joe, really do run their butts off making sure tables are opened, players moved, etc., which is something we rarely see in Ontario.

We were offered an immediate room change but decided that it was not worth the effort (as nothing was found) unless another bite occurred. Later in the day I was called to talk to the front desk Manager who also confirmed that nothing had been found and offered compensation for my inconvenience.

Our safe was broken when we arrived, and it took 1.5 days to get it fixed (well, they replaced it), but the hotel service was excellent, beyond that. I liked that the property was just off-Strip, which made getting in and out that much easier, and the valets were fast and efficient, as was the front desk staff. The decor of the hotel is good, and not too loud, but it is still kind of smoky in there, even at the \"non smoking\" section.

The service was excellent, the food at the buffet and at Big Al's restaurant was good and the slots were pretty reasonable. Now for the issues that need to be resolved. It seems like The Orleans, one of the most family friendly properties in Vegas, has become a stomping ground for prostitutes. I know that they are prevelant in every place in Las Vegas, but I never had a problem in my previous visits to the Orleans until this one. I got stopped three seperate times by girls wanting to provide me with a \"date\". I was polite and said no, and left and there were no problems. But why in the world would working girls come to a family friendly resort instead of the strip? Also another issue to be resolved is the kids here have gotten a lot more prevelent in the casino areas. I have seen security stop parents having their kids over with them at a slot/video slot machine while they were playing. I know that the casinos are more flexible with kids being in public areas, but maybe this policy needs to be revisited before one of these casinos loses their gaming license over it.

Lots of lounge chairs (we were even able to get 4 of them together with the hotel this packed!) Poolside food delivery is fun and reasonably priced. The bowling alley wasn't available for open bowl this time because of the tournament but our teens still had a great time going to the movie theater (about $8 per ticket). The buffet is delicious and the service there is just okay, but you get a discount with a Rewards card and the buffet ends up only being like $7 or $8 for most meals. The other restaurants in the food court (Subway, Sbarros Pizza, Baskin Robbins...) are also reasonably priced. We got a giant delicious pizza from Sbarros for about $25. The little gift shop near the hotel area has lots of trinkets and necessities at a decent price, and you get a small discount with a Rewards card. There is free Internet available at the little coffee cafe in the lobby area, and we used it several times. The only non-family-friendly part of the Orleans is the outfits of the servers on the casino floor - pretty low cut in front and almost a thong in the back (most of them wear black tights which helps a little but it is still uncomfortable when you have to walk your teens through there to get to the movie, bowling alley, and arcade). The location is fine - about 10 minutes from the Strip which is just the way we like it - we've not ever enjoyed staying on the Strip.

We were constantly accosted by people trying to sell us stuff like time shares; even in the lobby of several hotels. The pool was great, the fitness centre more than adequate, the staff was very accomodating, the choice of restaurants was fantastic and even though we lost several hundred dollars, I wouldn't say the games were tight. Everything you need on a vaction is here. It even has it's own liquor store, bowling alley and movie theatre.

This time for 5 nights and 6 long days. We split our stay into three nights on strip and 2 off strip at the Orleans. I have seen everything on the strip but like visiting but if I really want to play slots and actually have a chance of winning, I go off strip. While I wasn't a big winner, I did see others raking it in. This hotel is a large inclusive hotel with several restaurants including a Japanese restaurant, a coffee shop, TGI Friday's Fuddruckers, Sbarro, Subway, Baskin Robbins, the French Market Buffet and probably one or two more. They have a large showroom and get some big names. Most recently Lily Tomlin was there last week. We went to theirsmaller comedy club and saw Grandma Lee from America's got talent. It was a fairly good show of about 75 minutes. \"Grandma' has quite a potty mouth on her for a 77 year old! There was a very good band playing 70's and 80's rock hits called JukeBox Heroes from about 10-2:30 each night in their large bar with a dance floor. They even have a Cinemark and Bowling Alley on site so we did go the movie one afternoon. They have a kid's place and arcade so mom and dad can drop off the tikes and they can then gamble away the kids' college funds. Seriously, I would never bring kids to Vegas but apparently a million people seem to do it all the time so there are entertainment venues for them too. Our room was clean and the beds were comfortable. The room is a bit larger than some standard strip rooms and the bathroom is oddly shaped with a small counter, but I am used to large bathrooms so I am sure it probably adequate for most. They have an in-room safe and a standard box TV of about 25 or 27 inches. Air conditioning was plentiful for the 109 degree days we had and noise was not a problem like it can be for some strip hotels with all the sirens all night long. Prices for the rooms are reasonable. I was comped but could have gotten the room for about 25 a night for additional week nights and about 40 on weekends if booked well enough in advance. If you aren't too married to the strip, this hotel is a great option. Or split a longer stay and give this hotel a try. It's not the Bellagio or Wynn, and draws a pretty regular crowd and conventioneers but we enjoyed it and have stayed about 4 times here. At check in, I had about a two minute wait-very fast. The strip hotels had very long lines every time I went by a lobby on strip. Some probably had 30 minutes to an hour or more at lots of the big strip properties. I am not patient for standing in long lines if I have other options, so I tend to find places that won't have that problem. They now charge a 6.00 daily resort fee, up a dollar from last year. For this you get in room coffee, 10 minutes internet in the business center, free strip shuttle, free calls (like who needs this nowadays?) and maybe one or two other items of little consequence. Overall, I give it a Two Thumbs Up. If you have never been to Vegas, you can still stay here for much less and visit the strip. We rent a car and drive everywhere anyway.

A few years ago, I decided to try The Orleans and had such a great overall experience that it is about the only place I stay now. While I look for value, I want a clean room. Our room was impeccable, as was everywhere else in the hotel. My wife accompanies me on each trip. I'm the small-time gambler and she goes for the sun. The Orleans has everything you could want.

I stayed there a couple of weeks ago for 4 days and I still don't think I saw a lot of the slots they have. Most all of the machines I played seemed to have very reasonable paybacks, meaning my gambling dollars stretched nicely. Beyond that, every staff member I spoke to was not only courteous, but seemed to go out of their way to make my stay really enjoyable. I was able to check in early and check out a little late. (I know this would vary, depending on how busy the hotel is). For example, when my wife and I first got to our room, there weren't enough hangers for the amount of clothes we brought. I walked down the hall and found a maid and asked her for a few extra hangers. In less than 5 minutes, someone knocked on our door with 20 extra hangers.... asking if there was anything else we needed. I know this is a \"tiny\" thing, but it is a perfect example of just how we were treated during our entire stay. The restaurants are excellent, the buffet was great, they even have a Fuddrucker's in their food court!

We had stayed here once before about seven to eight years ago. We choose this property do to reviews from others here on Trip Advisor, and what they had said about our other favorite Vegas property The Flamingo. We arrived on a Sunday, check in was a breeze and they had a King Bed room available for us. (we were told that all were booked for Sunday but we could change on Monday) Our room was nice, large by Vegas standards. We had a view of the Pool and their Arena area. TV set could be upgraded to a flat panel. I know this sounds trivial, who goes to Vegas to watch TV....I do. It was nice to have a coffee pot in the room, didn't have to get up and go purchase $5.00 coffee in the Casino. We did opt to rent a small refrigerator which we kept soda pop and water in, another nice plus. Restaurants, our first night we ate at their Chinese Restaurant which was nice, food was good. Most days we ate in the food court, Fuddruckers was good, just needs more space, their the busiest restaurant with the smallest area, Sabarro's was the least busy and they had twice the shop space that any other establishment. We also ate one night at TGIFridays which I can say for the price wasn't worth it and I can not suggest this establishment to any guest. Plus this takes up a majority of area of the Casino floor. Poor choice for the Orleans. We ate at the Buffet, which was at one time one of the best in Vegas, can't say that anymore. Food was over cooked and wait staff was terrible. We did go to the Java Cafe, purchased to Frappacino's which I was told by the Starbucks personal that they were Iced Mocha's. This is the only place in the Hotel that has free Wi/Fi. Lastly most properties have a new hidden fee, they're calling it a Resort Fee, bunch of crap. Half the stuff they charge for a normal person wouldn't need on vacation. At least the Orleans is only charging $6:00 a day were some a charging almost $20.00 a day.

Our room , on 20th floor, was extremely clean when we arrived and remained that way throughout our stay. Had side view of the strip - Stratosphere Tower end.

This is, by no means, a small hotel. I believe that there are approximately 1,700 rooms. They have a large casino with several bars and restaurants scattered throughout the main floor. The hotel even has a bowling alley and a movie theatre. A shuttle runs about every twenty minutes until about midnight and drops you off right across the street from the Paris Hotel on the strip. It's about a 15 minute ride. For those of you who love the famous In N Out Burger, the only one located near the Las Vegas Strip is within walking distance (About a 1 mile walk) of the hotel.

The room was fab - big huge double beds (two of them0 and very very clean - we requested a high floor and had a fab view of the strip - especially at night time, so this is a big benefit v staying on the strip itself.

The shuttle running to the strip is ideal - it takes 10/15 minutes max and runs regulalrly, we never had to wait long for it and there were always seats - if you are put off staying at the Orleans due to the fact its not on the strip - dont be. The restaurants are fab, we ate at the breakfast buffet quite a few times and it is amazing value for money and excellent food - we did the breakfast buffet at Caesars Palace just for the experience - it too was wonderful and I would recommend it - but it is twice the price of the Orlenas one. The casino in the hotel is fabulous, and the drinks etc and betting thresholds are much lower than on the strip itself. We caught the shuttle to the strip and just walked and walked and walked - we went to all the main hotels, we also went to see Rita Rudner and saw the Lion King - if you like shopping, definitely go to the outlet malls - get a ticket for the bus on the strip - its $7 and lasts 24 hours - and just go north to the very last stop - you cant go wrong and the shops are amazing and so so cheap for designer lables!!

Enterprise rent-a-car was great as usual, but very limited choices on full-sized cars. Stopped for another great breakfast at Blueberry Hill (big portions, great food and service--1505 E. Flamingo at E. Viking). The property: This is a medium sized, off-Strip hotel with lots of amenities. It caters to a mid-to-low roller, older crowd, and locals. It is kid-friendly, but we did not see a whole lot of kids like at Circus Circus and Excalibur. There is plenty of free parking, and an event arena on-site hosting sporting events and concerts. Therefore, it can get suddenly crowded in the parking garage, at bars and in the casino. Arrived Orleans at 9am\u2014room not ready for early check in. Told to check back at about noon. Went to Trader Joe's Decatur, and returned at 10:30am. By then, check-in line had grown WAY long, and seems that rooms had been ready for a while (Moral: If you're tired and want your room ASAP, don't take for granted that rooms will be ready when desk person says they will be ready\u2014stick around, and watch activity at front desk). Pool was open, but water was too cold to swim. The only people there were four shivering kids playing Marco Polo who quit after about five minutes. Hot tub and kiddie pool were fine. Coast Liquors (near TGIFs): Excellent and reasonably priced liquor and wine selection. Lots of nearly full pay video poker on multi-play machines (including at bars), and some truly full pay deuces near TGIFs. The usual assortment of Keno and slots. There is a non-smoking gaming area near Market Street Buffet (maybe others). The pit was VERY crowded during peak times, but I could find a seat at most tables before 8pm and after midnight. Lines for restaurants were not crazy long (even on weekends), but there were lines to be sure. Food was decent, but would recommend you skip the coffee shop and opt for the buffet. I like to find cheaper food in Vegas coffee shops, and the prices at the Orleans aren't as cheap as I would like. The buffet is a better deal, and the offerings at Big Al's and TGIFs are better quality for not much more money. Great bowling alley, multi-screen theater with all the latest movies, good arcade for the kids, and very good day care at Kid's Tyme (big indoor playground tunnel tube slides, arts and crafts, video games, snack bar, etc.). There are so many services, it's like they don't want you to leave for any reason--ever. Comp room: Rooms are fairly large, with sitting area near window. We got two-night and three-night offers from our last stay six months prior (played our normal amount--nothing special) and were pleased to get free nights (five total on two separate offers) and dining credits ($60 total). On that visit we were not particularly impressed with the service, especially in the cafe, or the room, but this time things seemed to go much more smoothly. The hotel was extra busy because the WAC basketball tournament was happening in the Orleans Arena, so maybe the level of staffing was boosted, and therefore service was better. Pleased with our first two nights, we left town for a road trip through Arizona and Utah, returning five days later to stay three more comp nights. Service was still very good although the WAC crowd had mostly left.

I took him up on his offer since we had a few bags to carry. Within a minute, we had a bellhop at our car and he directed us to the check in desk. Went to the check in desk and the wife and I signed up for the Player's Club and got a ton of resort coupons. If you come here, do sign up because you can not only get discounts at the buffet and gift shop, but discounts on rooms for future visits too. And you can also save 5 cents a gallon of gas at any Rebel gas station. The room was nice and comfortable with a nice view of the Strip (thanks to the guy at check in for getting us a room with a cool view). The only qualms we had were a leaky faucet, which got fixed right away by maintenance, and finding someone's lip balm on the floor. Other than that, no complaints on the room front. Clean, comfortable and bigger than I expected. Our daughter loved the Kids Tyme area which is a good place to drop the little ones off while mom and dad go off and either play nickel video poker or have a nice dinner together. We did the former and they do have a good sized non smoking area. The casino was not as smoky as places like Circus Circus. In fact, the Ventilation in the whole casino was very good. Didn't feel overwhelmed by second hand smoke. The biggest complaint about the Kids Tyme area from our daughter was that she didn't get to spend enough time there thanks to mom and dad. They do have a lot of activities for the kids there from a huge chutes and ladders playground gym to video games and movies. The 24 hour bowling alley was also a hit as well. Lots of lanes and friendly service. We ate breakfast at the French Market Buffet. Good food and great prices. You could pay more but despite the low prices, they did not skimp on quality. Very good omelet station, awesome sweet potato pancakes and they had a killer biscuits and sausage gravy. Wife loved the cheese blintzes and our daughter loved the chocolate waffles. Breakfast burritos were a nice touch there too. When we go back, we will have to try lunch and dinner. Hear the crawfish and ribs are very good.

The atmosphere is much more relaxed compared to the strip and the service from check-in, cocktail waitresses, bartenders and dealers is always top notch. For $20 I saw a comedian, Nate Crosby, in the showroom on friday, another $22 for the hockey game in the Arena on Saturday, attended the Super bowl party in the lounge area on sunday. Great entertainment at excellent prices. I ate at the Mexican restaurant and it was very good and early bird specials for $8-10. The coffee shop was o.k. for a late night dinner and Al's Oyster bar was also a great deal for lunch under $15 (including tax and tip). I also recommend the $1.50 hot dogs at the sports book. they are large and steamed in beer. Excellent afternoon snack. For people who take pay schedules on video poker seriously, there are many 99%+ games available such as bonus poker, dueces wild and double double bonus available in all denominations. Table minimums for blackjack start at $5 until about 6pm when they go up to $10. I even got lucky and had a 6 hour run on Saturday morning. I did get a rental car, Budget is right across the street and Enterprise is 2 blocks away, but I also used the shuttle bus to the strip when I wanted to drink and it was always on time and rarely had to wait more than 15 minutes. I have stayed here before with my girlfriend who does not gamble but she enjoys the pool during the warmer months, the movie theaters and Prime Rib restaurant. The Orleans rooms are all pretty much the same no matter what tower you are in. They are on the larger side of a standard room measurement and have a seperate sitting area with couch and table and the bathrooms are large with a tub/shower combo. The matresses have all recently been replaced and I had no problem sleeping. The Orleans is not fancy like Bellagio or Wynn but most of the time rooms can be had for $40 on the website and with little play on the slot club card they send out offers for 2 free nights quite often.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mazomanie", "Title": "\u201cGreat\u201d", "Author": "DonnaD52", "ReviewID": "UR96262369", "Content": "Rooms very nice and clean.

How could I have let it slip away after working so hard to acquire a comfortable profit and why would I go anywhere else on my next trip. Although I did not stay exclusively at the Orleans for gambling purposes, I did a majority of my gambling dollars within the walls of its casino. I really like this hotel's rooms although it is showing its age somewhat. However, being approximately 550 sq. ft., the space allows one to move around without constantly saying \"Excuse me\" or bumping into something. There is also a courtesy safe in the room for personal use. The people are friendly from your arrival to the check-in desk--to the security at the elevators--to the casino itself--waitresses--pit crew--slot attendant, et al. It is off-strip--I like that for the noise level after hours and the crowded conditions on the strip; it is easily accessible to the strip via shuttle or car if one desires. The food is a good value for the dollar spent at the restaurants. The video poker has a much better return than found on the strip although I enjoy blackjack (3:2) and craps as well. The poker room provides good comps for the hourly player as well as interesting tournaments at a reasonable entry fee and positive structure for the player. If you have never tried the Orleans I would suggest you do so even if only to visit the casino. The player's club is very reasonable in rewards and on my five night trip, two nights were free via the rewards system (Friday & Saturday) as they offered 2 free (any) nights.

It opens late. We always play an hour or so after a dinner. Then there is a 18 screens movie theater. We usually choose our own favorite show and watch. Since we usually go to Vegas in summer. There are alots of good movie showing at that time. Then there is also a kid play area called Kids Tyme. It is a place where you can leave your child in a supervised environment. They have all those climbing things just like the Jump N. Jammin. They also have Wii, playstation, movie area, and coin free arcade for the kids. That place is for children 3 to 12 yrs old. You pay $6, or $7 per hour depending on weekday/weekend. Maximum stay is 5 hours each day. We usually drop the kids 1 or 2 hours, so I can grab a drink at the bar with my husband. So while the kids can have fun, we get to relax on our own. So, my kids love it alots. When they are happy, we are happy.

The Orleans is illuminated from the parking lot by obnoxiously bright external lighting so if you like a dark room, either ask for something below floor 7, and/or bring clothes pins to hold the drapes shut. Due to the obnoxious lighting, viewing the Strip is not actually soothing or pleasant, so just avoid looking out the window at night... Other than that, we did like the rooms a lot. I especially liked that the bathrooms have a small window over the tub that lets in fresh air, and you can also use it to yell at people in the street below or fly paper airplanes. What's on-site: Casino (with so-so video poker games, and surly pit bosses), bars (with so-so video poker and mostly good, but a few rude slacker bartenders--one refused to comp my girl a premium vodka, but comped it for me no-questions-asked five minutes later--what a female-hater!), several good restaurants (we liked the coffee shop's Orleans Omlette, Koji's sushi and miso soup, and TGIF's steaks) and a pretty good buffet, a bowling center, an arcade, movie theaters, drop-in child care (bring shot records!), and of course the big Orleans Arena. What's Nearby: There is a 24-hour Walgreens two blocks west, and a Trader Joe's up on Decatur (try the \"2-Buck Chuck\" Charles Shaw cabernet and the $1.99 Pinot Grigio!), a Terrible Herbst Chevron/convenience store, as well as the on-ramp to I-15 nearby. Other services: Shuttle to Gold Coast and Strip; Pool; Spa; Fitness Room; good hotel security. This hotel is set up to cater to low rollers and keep them from venturing too far afield--that way what's lost in Vegas stays at the Orleans. I mean seriously, if you just want to gamble and get drunk, this is better than the Strip. Also, it is pretty kids-friendly, and our 9-year old had a good time at Kids Tyme, the arcade and the pool. Overall, this hotel/resort is a very good deal (at $40 per night) even though they charge that stupid $5 per day \"RESORT FEE\"--the bean-counting genius who thought that one up should be hung by his heels off a hotel balcony--it's just dishonest pocket picking! An example of not great treatment by Orleans staff (besides the bartender dissing my girl over the vodka mentioned above) was when I went to place a $12/12 bet on 6 and 8 in the craps pit. The pit boss said \"Sir, this is a $10 minimum table,\" like I had just placed a roll of pennies on the pass line. I had $24 in my hand, and it was my first bet. Last time I took a math class, 12 > 10 if I recall correctly. Anyway, the point is, the Orleans caters to low rollers, but some employees don't seem to know that you don't MAKE a low roller FEEL like a low roller.

The staff were wonderful, security the best, the pools were extremly clean and well maintained. The beds were more than comfortable, clean, and the rooms were very spaceous. We asked for a room as high as we could in the tower and looking out over the Strip. It was no problem at all to ask. I sort of was wondering about staying on the 13th floor and it was lucky for us. We have stayed at nearly every place on the strip, and felt that the Orleans was as nice as any one of them. The shuttle was great because it took us to their sister hotel as well as Bills on the Strip. The shuttle is a bonus and I hope they never drop that from their agenda, because it brings people to and from the Strip. We had friends staying at the Mirage and Harrahs, and I know they said they would stay at the Orleans the next time they were in Las Vegas. The resturants located on site are all very very good. We went and saw a movie in the cinema , wanted to play a game of bowling, but just did not have the time left to do that. All in all it was just great.

Everybody appears to be super friendly, from the other guests you chat to in the lifts, to the cocktail waitresses, the room maids, the restaurant staff, it's just generally a happy and comfortable place to stay. Ate in several of the reasonably priced restaurants - the Courtyard Cafe can't be beaten for a cheap filling breakfast. They say the Shuttle to The Strip runs every half hour but in reality is more frequent than that, I never waited more than 10 minutes and I timed the journey - 7 minutes door to door. And it's so good to come back to the relative calm of The Orleans after a long day or evening battling the craziness of The Strip, staying that couple of blocks away just gives you a bit of a welcome distance from the bustle. The pool area is spacious with loads of towels and loungers and a lovely bubbly warm spa. There is of course a massive casino but with low minimum limits (good for a starter like me) but on top of this you have a multi screen movie cinema, bowling, free music in the evenings, free wifi in Seattle's Best, tons of welcome offers and all for $30 a night!

I had stayed here before and been here several times before and we had 2 of 3 nights comped so it was a no-brainer. The hotel was as I remembered it but the floors in the rooms were dirty/stained and could use an update. These rooms look almost the same as the rooms at Bill's Gambling Hall and must have been built by the same builder. Bathrooms are almost identical all the way down to the stained glass opening window above the bathtub. The room has a standard TV and could use a flatscreen. There is a safe bolted to a board in the bathroom.The closet area is also in the bathroom. Our beds were very clean and comfortable. We stayed on the 13th floor, (something you often will not find in a casino hotel), but since we aren't superstitious, it didn't bother us. WE were asked if floor thirteen would be okay and we said sure. Our first night there, we left to see O over at Bellagio and it was great. The next night, we decided to partake of their movie theatre and went to see a late show and get away from the casino for a while. That casino can get smokey at times and my eyes paid the price for it. I had to see an opthamologist the Monday after we returned as my glands in one eye had swollen into a painful lump. That is what 5 nights in the desert and smoke can do. I suppose it is allergies, bacteria, smoke, lack of humidity which I am used to and other things. My eyes never take Vegas well, though I do love it. If you play video poker, there are tons of machines in varying games and denominations for you to play here. The table games were mostly full all the time. Drink service was fairly consistent though once a girl took my order and never returned. I gave up on her after 45 minutes and a new waitress had taken her place. They have plenty of eating venues so that you won't have to leave unless you just want to. One thing that aggravated me is that while waiting in the French Market Buffet, there were two people ahead of us and the line was about 15 minutes wait. Well 2 people came up to the ones in front of us and jumped the line, then 3 more, then 2 more then baby stollers and moms and more! I started to get mad. Folks should go to the end of the line rather than take a dozen people cutting just because you saw someone you knew in line. Bad form and bad manners. Folks go to the end! It is rude to the 40 of us you are cutting in front of! This casino seems to cater to middle america and lots of working class folks and locals. I saw a number of \"gansta looking guys\" walking the floor with the arm swinging behind the back and the one leg saunter and the face that looked like they were one sneeze away from plugging some people. I guess what I am saying is that there were even a few seedy looking folks there. It did not bother me, but was just an observation. You don't see as much of that in the hotels like Wynn or Bellagio. The clientele is different here especially on the weekends compared to the expensive strip hotels. Nevertheless, if they send me comps, I will continue to come.

The French Market Buffet is okay, typical buffet type food and affordable. The line at the buffet can be long, but it moves quickly. Resist the temptation to go to the other cafe because of its shorter line. (The food is terrible.) The pool area is small, but very pleasant. I had a massage at the spa and was very pleased with it as well. We enjoyed the Orleans Hotel very much and will go back again. The only down side to our stay was that we didn't win much on the slots, neither did anyone else that we talked to; we had much better luck at the Venetian. The comedy acts in the Orleans Showroom, Tom Papa and Bill Burr were a riot.", "Date": "June 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pewaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cRemember the Stardust, then you'll enjoy the Orleans!\u201d", "Author": "RoyalFlush2010", "ReviewID": "UR69008802", "Content": "When the Stardust closed I needed to find another hotel and casino that made you feel like you were in Vegas.

Our stay was paid for by my husband's company, so I can't really comment on the price, but our friend did stay Friday night for only $39 or so...can't beat that. We come to Vegas twice a year or so, and alternate staying on strip vs. off strip. Staying off strip is great...cheaper limits, cheaper drinks, food etc....but it also means more kids! I mean, it's ridiculous really, the amount of people who take children to an adult playground. It wasn't just here either, we noticed it everywhere on the strip too. I mean, people are stumbling around wasted at 2 am, and there is a 3 year old in line with his father at the ATM. But anyway.... Hotel: Very clean and modest overall. Check-in was quick and the casino level is easy to navigate. Rooms were clean. You can tell they have tried to give the rooms modern updates (granite countertops, nice beds!), but it also had a dated feel (bathtub, TV, carpet). Bed was super comfy and the halls were quiet. Casino: Low limits. Had trouble finding a lot of double deck blackjack though, as I don't like to play single. Tables always seems crowded too and my husband complained about a dealer at one point, but he may have just been in a bad mood b/c he's just lost hehe. Overall, friendly bartenders and drink service was good. Played most of my blackjack at Carnival Court...that's where it's at. Restaurants/Food: Worst part of my stay. Granted, I did not eat at the nicer ones (Prime Rib Loft, the steakhouse), but we did eat at the Courtyard Cafe, the food court and Big Al's Oyster Bar. The breakfast in Courtyard was the best meal I had here, very good. However, I made the mistake of grabbing Sbarro's on the go...gross! Big Al's was the worst though. First we ordered a po boy, but they were out of the fish we wanted, so they gave us shrimp. It tasted freezer burnt and the bread was stale and generic. I took one bite and spit it out. Nightlife: Non-existent. The Irish Pub had some entertainment...cheesy dueling guitar players. OK for the first night since we were tired from a 5 hr flight, went to the strip the rest of the time. Pool: Excellent! Again, except for the millions of children, not bad! The cabanas are only $50 Sun-Thurs, and $75 Fri-Sat. so we had one on one day. No pool service though which struck me as odd. Even most off strips have servers that come around, esp. at the cabanas, but it was no big deal...bar was nearby. Never had a problem finding a chair either. Spa/Fitness: Not bad. Spa was average but clean. Cheap too. We prefer to indulge a time or two and spend the $40 facility fee at Caeser's or Canyon Ranch though. Overall, The Orleans is not a bad off strip hotel to stay. Great prices, clean rooms, free shuttle (although we took cabs), and friendly service.

The check-in was efficient and fast, as well as check out. The rooms are well appointed and I recommend a room with the window facing west, since if you are in the room at sunset, the view of the sun setting over the mountains is fantastic! I have a friend that lives in Las Vegas/Henderson and so I actually am one of the few people that does not come to Las Vegas to gamble. The casino floor was always busy however and is well laid out. I enjoy the Seattle's Best Coffee store in the lobby (near the valet entrance on the east, next to the bell stand). In addition to great coffee drinks, the have a variety of baked goods, and in the seating area, you can access the internet wirelessly. It is a great place to connect online if you do not want to pay the $12.99 for 24 hours of access in your room. The rooms are quiet, and I would recommend an upper floor room. The French Market Buffet is reasonably priced andt their is a wide variety of other restaurant choices. I would advise signing up online to receive their special promotions newsletter. I received a rate of $26.99 a night plus $10 food credit per day $5 in slot play (which I didn't use). Online room rates are usually around $35 a night (with a deposit of one nights stay) and have a 72-hour cancellation policy unlike many places who require advance payment of the entire amount, which is non-refundable if you need to cancel..

I received a 20th floor queen room and it was spacious and comfortable as all the rooms seem to be at this hotel. Now I know the location is a negative for a lot of people but let me give you some friendly advice. The hotel provides a free shuttle service to and from the strip as well as the gold coast casino, the trip in total takes barely 5 minutes and the shuttle runs about every 20 minutes starting at 9 am till sometime around midnight. The prices of food and services on the strip have almost completely turned me off staying on the strip. The average buffet prices on the strip are 13.99 breakfast 15.99 lunch and 20.99 dinner compared to the Orleans 6.99 breakfast 7.99 lunch and 11.99 dinner and if you show your club coast card to the restaurant you recieve a dollar off their already amazing prices. They also have other restaurants such as fridays which has an all day happy hour and 1/2 price appetizers, 2 large draft and an order of wings cost me 12 dollars, amazing value. Big al's oyster bar has some amazing new orleans fare, I tried the gumbo and it was delicious and it was enough for 2 people. Now lets not forget the staff and dealers. Another big thing for me is friendly staff that help make my wins as well as my losses feeling like I enjoyed myself. In particular \"THE CRAPS CREW\" , Pit boss martin and dealers manuel , jon , joe , david and the others whose names I don't remember are top notch and made every second of my time on the table enjoyable and the low limits which start at five dollars help extend your gambling budget. I really can't say enough about this place, I was intrigued the first time I went there and and my expectations have been blown away by the service , value and overall enjoyment of this place .

I don't gamble but the casino looked big enough to me and seemed to be full of folks having a good time.

We didn't mind that it was off The Strip at all -- it was nice to experience the glamour and insanity and then retreat to someplace somewhat quieter. We're in our 40's so it was nice getting away from the hedonistic bachelor/bachelorette party crowd. I don't think any casino in Vegas (or Vegas itself, frankly) can be considered \"family friendly\", but if you were clueless enough to take your kids there, The Orleans would be a pretty decent bet, especially since they have a bowling alley and a multiplex cinema on-site. Why anyone would take their children to Las Vegas is beyond me, but there were plenty of them there, let me tell you! The Orleans was very clean and had a very courteous staff. One kudos I have to give to Las Vegas in general is that the service industry is very in-tune with customer service. Everyone, everywhere is very helpful no matter how you are dressed. I didn't gamble a cent and I was still treated like a special person wherever I went. The Orleans pool was very nice -- low-key, but large and sheltered. I enjoyed it a great deal. The fitness center was small but very clean and nice. We at at the buffet and it was a good all-around meal at a great price -- not anything spectacular like what we experienced at The Wynn, but great value and nothing tasted bad. It's rather strangely laid-out though -- pancakes are next to crawdads which are next to tacos which are next to eggs benedict. Doesn't really matter I guess, but I had a laugh about what a jumble it was. Rooms were clean and the bed was very comfortable. Our room faced the Strip which was nice, but you also have a commanding view of the strip club next door. Water pressure in the bathrooms was excellent and hot water was almost instantaneous. Downsides? The door to the room opens directly into the sleeping area -- anyone walking by can see right onto your bed if you open the door. I prefer the bed to be set back and not viewable by the general public. As a result, you are also quite a bit closer to noisy people in the hall. Bring earplugs for people coming back late at night or little Billy running down the halls and screaming at his sister. The rooms were spacious, clean, well-maintained and comfortable, but at least on the 13th floor (yes, I was surprised to see that there are buildings that actually have a 13th floor -- I suppose in Vegas they don't want you to be lucky though) they needed upgrading. The furniture in blond oak, quite late 80's/early 90's, and they still have tube TV's. The bathroom was very spartan and the fixtures were a bit dated. I don't know, when I stayed at Luxor years ago they had granite everything and it made me feel like I was having an experience. The Orleans is like your grandmother's 1992 condo. I'd stay there again. I'd recommend people to go to Vegas Sun-Thurs -- you get a LOT more for your money that way.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice change from the Strip\u201d", "Author": "Cdot78", "ReviewID": "UR65025716", "Content": "The Orleans offered a nice break from staying on the Strip.

We have stayed here a few other times and this time was no different; we were again very pleased with our stay overall. We asked for and received a \"mountain view\" room on the 19th floor, so this room was not one of the rooms to undergo a remodel as far as flat screen t.v., etc. While our room was not ritzy it fits our taste. The only couple of minor things was that the t-paper tolder needed to be reattached to the wall better as one of the screws must have been stripped (we did not complain so I won't fault them for not fixing it), the other thing was that on the couple of nights where the wind was unrelenting it created a whistling type of noise which at times was very annoying when trying to sleep. We solved the problem on the 2nd night by putting a bath towel along the bottom of the door. But, all in all, the service was good, the room was nice, we love the casino atmosphere a lot, even though we don't go to vegas specifically to gamble; we like to use it as a base and go visit Mt. Charleston, Red Rock, Valley of Fire, etc. The housekeeping staff was very efficient. Most everyone employed by the hotel who we would pass in the halls would speak to us first with a smile. You can't beat the rate of around $28 a night with the Club Card. The addition of the Subway, Sbarro's, etc., came in quite handy for several meals. While we did not go to see a movie, they allowed my husband entry to buy us a bag of popcorn which we then took back to our room to sit and enjoy the sunset with, while sipping margaritas. I know this hotel would not fit everyone's need, but it certainly does ours. The distance from the strip doesn't ever bother us as we rent a car every time we go.

However, staff were very friendly when we returned to see if they had a room free and even though our second room wasn't as great as our first it was fine. We were pleased that rooms are very large and have everything you need. I had read that the safe was free standing but in both rooms they were bolted down. A security guard is by the lifts and at night you have to show a room key to go up in the lifts. Seemed far more security minded than MGM. The buffet was cheap but good. I couldn't fault it and it compared well to the MGM but cost half the price. Transport to the strip was easy on the shuttle and we never waited long. It runs till 12.30 but easy to get a bus back after this time. The bus stop is outside the hotel that also gets you down to the strip by MGM. A petrol station is on the corner for cheap cigarettes (Brits) and a bank of America is a short walk away. (Casino cashiers pointed this out to us, when stranded, so we could draw some cash on the old credit card). We loved the variety of slot machines and seemed to win more often than when in the larger strip casinos. People were very normal who were playing. No silly screaming that we always heard in the MGM! We never waited long for drinks. The players card gave us a dollar off per person at each meal. The points we collected were worth one dollar per 1000 points and this was taken off our room bill. They did charge $5 extra per night room charge but considering how cheap rooms are it wasn't a problem. My husband made use of the gym which he liked. you get 10 mins computer time free then $5 for each extra 15 mins. Great for keeping in touch. The pool area was adequate and not far from the lifts (unlike MGM where you have to walk for 10 mins to get there). We were more than happy with this hotel and obviously saved alot of money compared to staying in a strip hotel. If you are snobbish and like the glitz of the posh hotels then this place is not for you, but if you are normal,enjoy a comfy room, friendly staff and playing slots or at tables then the Orleans is perfect! P.S if the lovely couple read this then can I thank them for the kind offer of lending us \u00a3100 if we needed it.

We had been traveling around the area visiting Bryce, Zion and the Grand Canyon before flying out of Vegas. We choose the hotel because of the price, the location (we had heard that the strip is a zoo - which it is), the reviews and because it seemed \"child friendly\". We paid something like $75 per night. For that price, we didn't know what to expect. What a pleasant surprise! The hotel/casino has all the fun and feel of Vegas without the headaches of being on the strip. It is clean and festive with the Mardi Gra atmophere. The employees were friendly and helpful througout our stay. Our room was HUGE and in perfect order. We had a room with two beds and a nice sitting area (love seat, coffee table, single chair, plus some lamps. The bathroom was also nice size. In fact, my husband and I joked that we could put a cot in it and use it as another bedroom. One of their best features is their beautiful pool. We're not big pool people, but we literally had to drag ourselves away from the pool to go to dinner. It was so relaxing. Along with the main pool, they have what is almost a child's pool (it's only about a foot and a half deep), and one of the nicest hot tubs I've ever seen. Theirs is shaped like a doughnut. There is an island of trees, flowers and shrubs in the center surrounded by a large ring of warm water to sit and relax in. Consequently, even if others are in the tub, it's very private and peaceful. I'm guessing that if people sat side-by-side, you could fit about one hundred people in it - so it's not some small hot tub. We had heard that they have movie theaters and bowling alleys in the hotel, though didn't try them out. Another really nice feature is the free shuttle service that drops you off on the Strip in front of the Bellagio Hotel - a great location! There is no need to drive once at the hotel. In regard to parking, they offer free valet parking (you just pay for the tipping) or a huge self-park parking lot. Should we visit Las Vegas again, we'll be staying at the Orleans for sure. It's the best deal in town! Suggestion: Try to avoid getting a room that faces the pool. When we were there, we heard some complain about the noise of a pool party that took place a couple nights before we arrived. I don't know if they still have the pool parties or not, but at the time of our visit, they held them every weekend.", "Date": "April 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Billings, Montana", "Title": "\u201cThe Orleans is the most enjoyable, accommodating place to stay.\u201d", "Author": "blessing4589", "ReviewID": "UR61368128", "Content": "The rooms are always clean, comfortable and conveniently arranged.

On the last occasion, the roof --figuratively speaking-- collapsed. Spanish and Latino staff are usually polite; for example, I stayed at a nearby hotel.

The woman seemed angry at virtually everyone at the table; a young Spanish gentleman being the one, possible, exception. Several guest left the table. I left the casino.

The rooms are good sized rooms. The bed is comfortable. Nothing extraordinary, but not horrible. The bathroom - the shower was nice - good pressure, good amount of water. Though there is a window right there with no real way of blocking it. If you are near the elevators, there's a chance someone in another room could *possibly* see inside your shower while you are there. The television... only one word could describe it - suck. There are only about 5 or 6 real channels to choose from (all the rest are hotel channels). But let's face it... nobody is in Las Vegas to hang out in the rooms...and the casinos don't want you in your room, anyway. If you smoke, the Orleans is your kind of place. I understand that smoking is allowed in all of the casinos, but the Orleans seems to be quite a bit more smoky than any of the strip hotels. That alone keeps me from making this a \"recommend.\" The Fuddruckers is 24 hours. They and Sbarro (and maybe Subway?) provide room service. As far as I could tell, there are no decent restaurants in the neighborhood, so the casino restaurants are really the only choices. There is a free shuttle that will take you to Bill's Gambling Hall on the strip or the Gold Coast near the Rio and Palms. During parts of the day (think around 5pm) it fills up fast. It's quite common for people to be denied boarding because the shuttle is full. A cab ride will cost about $11 (including tip) one way to the Tropicana. A cab ride down to Fremont is about $25 (including tip). If you want to spend your time here in a cheaper hotel but still be on the Strip, I'd recommend the Circus Circus.

First the pros- you can't beat the price for what is essentially a mini-suite on a weekend in Vegas. The rooms are larger than average and have a small living room area as well as a spacious bathroom/shower with safe, all for under $100 per night. The place is ideal for kids with a movie theater, bowling alley, arcade and cool play zone that serves as a babysitter while you gamble. Room service was fast and adequate and there are multiple restaurants and fast food locations to eat on the premises. Now the cons- like most of the older Vegas hotels this one is incredibly smoky. If this doesn't bother you, great, but it made my wife and I feel sickly and congested all weekend, and all of our clothes now smell like smoke. And if you like sleeping, stay elsewhere. The walls were thin and the doors even thinner. We generally went to bed around midnight and wanted to wake around 7am. However you can hear every opening/closing door down the long corridor as well as people's voices, which occured at 2am, 3am, 6am, etc. The beds were horribly uncomfortable and the pillows super thin. We basically tossed and turned for 3 nights while being woken up by random noises several times each night. This was exacerbated by the fact that it was a cheer competition with hundereds of little girls running down the halls and playing \"doorbell ditch\" at all hours (at least on our floor). On a regular non-kid event weekend with some earplugs and your own pillow, you might be OK. Parking was also very tough and one night I found not a single space available despite it being a HUGE lot. Valet was 20 cars deep so not the best alternative either. If you want a cheap, uncomfortable, kid-friendly place off the strip, stay here. If you want some comfort, ventilated air, and to be closer to the real action (fancy hotels, nightclubs, people watching), pony up some money and stay at one of the finer establishments on the strip.", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "buffalo", "Title": "\u201cHad a great time\u201d", "Author": "trixBuffalo", "ReviewID": "UR56742815", "Content": "Our first visit with friends was great - we are all looking forward to going back.

I was a little concerned about the lack of natural daylight, but he had fun and wanted to go there each day for an hour or two. I found the service non-existent after the quite efficient check-in. We had maid service on only one of our three days there (one day because we said don't bother, as we were already home after a day out and didn't want to have to leave the room again); and when I called reception to enquire whether I'd get a prompt about the next $11.99 24 hour period for wifi internet starting (because there was no answer on the tech support line), was greeted by an incredulous tone saying \"I don't think so! It's up to you to record what time you start and know when it finishes\". This was probably adding insult to injury really, as I was pretty disgusted at being charged for wifi in the first place - it's been free everywhere else we've stayed in the states. And to extend that logic, if I select and pay for an in-room movie, will it just keep playing more movies unless I press stop?? The casino smelt of horrible sickly sweet cleaning product and stale cigarette smoke. To give credit where it's due though, the rooms were nice. And the mexican restaurant was okay too. In hindsight, I would rather have stayed at somewhere like the Flamingo, which looked nice (except for the lack of a kids club which gives the Orleans some kudos).

I asked for a room on the 20th or 21st floor with a strip view. I knew from the TA Las Vegas forum, rooms on those two floors had been updated with flat panel TVs. The 20th floor was available, but not with a strip view, however a lower floor strip view room was. I asked the girl behind the desk which room she would choose. She said the 20th. We had room 2093 with a south view. The room is definitely larger than a standard hotel room. They do have an odd shape as the bathroom is at the back of the room. We had a king size bed. Quite comfortable with soft sheets. The room also has a desk w/ mirror & chair, sofa & chair, coffee table & end table, large safe, one cup coffee maker, full length mirror, 42 inch flat panel TV, large window, A/C \u2013heat thermostat control (rather than just an on-off). The bathroom is two rooms. A single sink with enough counter space and open closet with shelf. Iron & ironing board. Then the toilet and tub/shower. There is a window that opens above the tub. We could see Mandalay Bay, Luxor and Excalibur from it. The only thing I did not like about the room, was the dresser. It was very small. One small drawer and two shelves. I used the shelf above the hanger rod in the bathroom for most of our clothes. The room was spotless and in excellent shape. You could tell the carpet had been freshly shampooed. Our room had 10 foot ceilings. It made the room feel even more spacious. We were very pleased with the room!

They didn't have any strip view available but they put us on the 19th fl mountain view away from the elevator. Room 1925. I was pleased with the size of the room, clean carpet, decent bedding. The heater/ac was a litle noisey but seems like most are. (at least it didn't rattle or vibrate) Didn't really like how the shower/toilet/sink/closet were all in the same side room but not enough to complain. It's too bad you can't pick your neighbors, ended up with rude door/drawer slammers the 2nd and 3rd nite. (Not the Orleans fault.) Plenty of $5 tables, craps and 21 are what we played. Also played a bit of 5 cent video poker. All the dealers and pit bosses were friendly even when we were winning. The band they had in the free entertainment area was fun and seemed to please all the guest watching. I sat at the bar the last nite for 4 hrs playing video poker listening to the band, drinking for free and broke even by the time I left. They have a liquor store across from Fridays that had really good prices for alcohol (discount with a players card) and reasonably priced cigars. Bought a 750 bottle of Skyy for under $11. Only thing I didn't like at this Hotel was the Cafe restaurant . We went down for breakfast about 10am. No line, got seated in a reasonable amount of time. Waited 5 min and someone asked us if we wanted something to drink, yes water. Another 5 minutes the water arrived and I asked if we could place our order, no someone else will take your order. 2 min later a hispanic women comes by and drops 2 napkins on the table and then drops the forks, knives and spoons in a pile - plop! Then just turns and walks away. NICE! Then the water came. Few minutes later the waitress came, very polite and took our order. They had a steak and eggs special for $7.99, we both ordered it. 10 minutes later the food arrived and it looked great. But, it didn't taste so great, the hash browns were undercooked on the bottom side and the steak tasted at best like bland liver. So disappointing, it looked so good and we were so hungry. Even a bath in A-1 didn't help. The eggs were fine, scrambled and not over cooked. Never saw the waitress again. Grabbed a burger late one nite after drinking and gambling at Fuddruckers that was really good. Did an oyster shooter at the Oyster bar that was ok. It was a Belvedere shooter, I thought it would have some kind of spice or seasoning but it was just a nice sized shot of Vodka with a raw oyster dropped into it. Next time I'll order the vodka with cranberry and get the oyster shooter the traditional way. If they had that on the menu, I didn't see it. Also saw a movie (Avatar 3-D), while we were there. Nice big typical movie house in the Hotel. Deja Vu is across the street and if you show your room key they'll let you in for free but I'd skip it and find another venue.

You will hear NO noise from neighbors. You will hear only a rare noise from the hallway because the 40 pound door blocks most of the noise. Room is spacious and has a sofa, desk, coffee table, bureau, and metal frame head board. Yes, its not the Venetian. If you want marble bathroom walls and terrazzo flooring and sunken living rooms then pay three times as much for the Venetian. If you want a clean quiet room near the action at a bargain price then Orleans may work for you. Orleans offers a free shuttle to and from the strip (dropped at the corner of Bills, Bally's and the Bellagio) that runs every half hour. So if you want to bum around the strip and then be able to get away from it you can retire to your off strip room. I read some complaints about slow check-in, but we arrived at the back end of a shuttle from the airport and the line was 25 people long and we were still checked in within 10 minutes. Hotel gift shop is overpriced. If you forgot something there is a Walgreens at the intersection of Decauter and Tropicana (one block southwest of the property). As for the casino floor - we found it as spacious and comfortable as any strip hotel, great bowling alley, movie theater, and arcade. Wireless internet at a convenient cafe. Poker room is great. We enjoyed being away from the noise and fast pace of the strip hotels. Orleans is more relaxed and laid back. Convenient free parking near the main entrance. Orleans buffet offers a great deal: for about $20 you can eat all day. You can enter and leave the buffet as many times as you wish, can cut to the front of the line, and get priority seating. The food is on par with more expensive hotels and the selection is amazing. Knocks: the knocks against the Orleans are the same knocks as any other Vegas hotel. No free in-room internet, television channel selection is not great, and obviously there is no free continental breakfast. But you didn't go to Vegas to hole up in your room and the hotel wants to you downstairs gambling and not watching TV -- so get over it.

The Orleans is an above average off-strip resort with all the amenities you could think of, except proximity to the strip. If you appreciate value, the Orleans delivers. They have a great game of double-deck pitch blackjack with good rules (double after split, resplit aces) and pay 3:2 on blackjack. The minimums are sometimes $5 at slow times, and no more than $10 even at peak times. They seemed to have a $5 craps table open whenever I walked past. Cocktail service is very good, and the girls are dressed in skimpy outfits! Yeah baby! I don't care to spend a bunch of money on food, especially when there with my buddies, and the Orleans was perfect in this regard. They have several low priced restaurants. I had a burger at Terrible Mikes and it was fantastic. They have Subway (perfect for a late night meal after enjoying those free cocktails all night). Best of all is a discount liquor store right in the casino that is at least 20% cheaper than off strip liquor stores. The rooms are more than adequate. The rooms were clean, though when we checked in on a busy weekend, we were given a smoking room even though we requested non-smoking. They sprayed something in the room that helped, but the smell was noticable again in the morning. Tip - I take a small bottle of fabreeze to Vegas, wherever I stay. Helps mask the smokey smell on your clothes and you can spray it in the room to freshen it up. The worst part about the Orleans is the distance to the strip, especially if you are there to party. Getting a bunch of guys together to grab 2 or more taxis just to go over to the strip is a pain. They do have shuttle service to Bill's Gamblin Hall on the strip for free, but it is slow because you go to Gold Coast on the way. If you are primarily there to gamble, relax, and get the best bang for your buck, you can't beat the Orleans. But if you are there to party and experience Vegas, a strip hotel will do better for you... you can't beat a strip hotel and being able to just walk out of your hotel and go from casino to casino.", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio", "Title": "\u201cThe most exciting entertainment in Las Vegas for the value.\u201d", "Author": "thewilliamsmd", "ReviewID": "UR52417295", "Content": "The Orleans offers an exciting oray of fun and entertainment that leaves you without time to tour the strip.

We weren't disappointed! The Orleans is every bit as good as the reviews say. We booked online and got a steal of a deal for a mid-week stay. Our king room was enormous, with a small sitting area by the window, and the bathroom was huge. The room was spotless, bed was incredibly comfy, with a white duvet and good pillows, and the decor was actually pretty nice. Nice lighting too. I've stayed in Marriot and Westin hotels in other cities that didn't have as nice a room as this one! We had a really nice view as well of the mountains west of Vegas. The pool was great; lots of palm trees and green surrounding an enormous main pool, with a smaller warm pool and a pool-sized hot tub tucked away at the back. Lots of chairs as well. We liked it so much we booked a second two-night stay! Only two drawbacks to the hotel: 1) there's a $5 per day \"resort fee\" per room, which apparently covers coffee, fitness center, pool. It doesn't include free wi-fi in the room (there is free wi-fi in the lobby, or you can pay for wi-fi in the room). As far as resort fees go, seems that quite a few of the Vegas hotels are now charging them, and they're anywhere up to $15 per day! In comparison, $5 isn't that much, but it's bit annoying to be paying for things that other hotels don't charge for. 2) The hotel isn't on the strip, it's a good mile or so away. There's a shuttle that goes every 40 minutes or so, or if you have a car, it's a quick drive and there's lots of free parking at the big hotels on the strip.

The rooms are clean as is the hotel itsself. Check-in and check-out when smoothly and we encountered no problems with billing or our reservations. If your looking for luxury stay at one of the high price hotels on the strip as this hotel is not the Palms, Rio, Ventian, etc. and doesn't pretend to be. But for the price I don't think one can find a better hotel. Yes, it's off the strip but one also doesn't have to put up with the rush and crowds that wonder into the other casinos on the strip. Let's just say it gives you that small town feeling in a big city. The price is great as we got two nights comp and only paid $42.00 a night for the other two nights, granted it was Sunday thru Thursday but I couldn't find a hotel on the strip offering comparable pricing. Every year we say we're going to try another hotel on the strip but we keep coming back to the Orleans because of the price, service and cleanliness of the rooms. The rooms are not the fancy luxury rooms you find on the strip but who spends alot of time in the room except to sleep. I can guarantee you if the rooms were not clean we'd be staying somewhere else. The pool is nothing fancy but serves the purpose. We did find the casino area more smoky this time than our previous visits for whatever reason. We only ate at Fridays, the Courtyard cafe and the Market buffet at which the food and service was fine for the price, but I'm not a great fan on buffets. After many years I've come to the conclusion it's not one casino or the other that pays better but the slot machine you happen to be on as I've won on some of the slots and lost on others, it all comes down to luck. They have cut back on staff as I didn't see the cocktail girls come around as often as before while playing the slots. If you stay during the weekdays they also have limited live entertainment but we took the shuttle down to the strip and went to some of the other expensive hotels to watch the lounge shows.

At this time we should have been told where everything was and the rules (including the 5.00 per day resort fee) The in-room cost of internet (which is 12.99 per day) however you can acess it at Seattle'ss Best for free. She should also have told us that the security guard at the elevators would check our right to be in the hotel portion of the casino. I Knew about this only from Trip Advisor. But I would rather have them check it. The only time we were checked was at shift change, otherwise we were free to come and go - you just need to say hello to security on your way too and from so that they will remember you. The Orleans has a shuttle that will take you to the strip. It runs from 9am to 12:30 am and picks up about every 10 min. If you prefer a cab: cost from the MGM Grand to the hotel was only 6.50 (remember to tip) The French market buffet is amazing and fairly inexpensive. You can buy a wristband for all three meals for the cost of dinner and lunch. If you don't go for any other reason - go for the desserts. Those are worth the cost alone. All the staff on the floor were very helpfull. from the maids to the food court to the cocktail waitresses on the floor. I would highly recommend The Orleans. The decor alone is different from the rest of the casino - and fun. Rooms are very clean and exactly as pictured. No bait and switch going on here. Coffe pot is actually a single serve pod brewed into a cup. Safe didn't have any instructions (again check-in should have explained) Beds clean and comfortable. Very little noise could be heard by near-by quest rooms. Some of the rooms have great views of the strip. Parking is on an open muli-level structure, Walking to room with 5 bags was a bit of a pain but they do have a valet. Very secure and is patrolled. Pool area is pretty but closes at 6pm.

So for 40 USD incl. tax pr. night you get a big room, big bathroom, all clean, money box, TV (with around 20 channels) and many things to do. And many of the rooms have a view to the mountains - ours did as well. No breakfast is included in the price, but for 8,10 USD incl. tax you get a full buffet. Or else, you can take All-you-can-eat for a day for around 24 usd incl. tax, but our experience shows that if you got a full breakfast (they serve it until 10.30, where it changes to lunch buffet) you won't need lunch at all:) The place also had a couple of other restaurants, and only in 1 of them the staff was friendly and smily. They also offer fast food stations, if you're up for that, but it's not cheap compared to the buffet, where it's a lot of choice. The place is not near the strip, but they have a free shuttle that runs every 20 min to the center of the Strip. It takes max 10min, and I wouldn't pay 50 USD more just to stay closer to that. It really went easy with the shuttle. The casino is huge, both smoking and non-smoking areas available. They have movies and bowling, which we haven't tried. Very nice pool, actually 3 of them - regular OK big, childrens pool and a warm spa pool, really nice, not small at all. Free parking. Internet is only free at the coffee shop. Otherwise they charge you 12 USD pr. day. The only minus was that the waiters at the buffet (breakfast/lunch and dinner acailable) DO NOT smile.

Loved it! The rooms are big, always kept very clean and maid service is done daily and are friendly. The hotel rooms are a little dated however at \u00a329 per night (dependant on time of year) who can complain. The hotel has everything you need, 11 restuarants, bowling alley, cinema, arcade, good gambling tables and 3 pools to name but a few. The pool area is good, has everything you need inlcuding big pool, baby pool and jacuzzi and the drinks are reasonably priced, throughout the hotel also. Food good, although due to the large portions and the heat we tended to only eat two meals a day if that. We also noticed the new carpets throughout the casino area, more staff at check in and the casino is not as smokey, Staff were always helpful and friendly. The only downside is the location. Last year and up until the 14th september this year(luckily as we left a few days later) the free courtesy bus has changed. It used to drop you off at Bills across from the Bellagio where all the action is and was very frequent, every 10 minutes or so as there was a few of them and the bus journey took 5 minutes. However after the 14th September this year the bus now drops you off at the Tropicana and picks you up less frequent, every half hour or so and takes alot longer, half hour or so dependant on traffic (which in vegas is busy busy 24/7). There is an upside as the Tropicana is right next to MGM, NewYork NewYork, Monte Carlo and a short walking distance to Mandalay Bay and Luxor. We done all that in one day and night. In my opinion though your better of at the Bellagio, Paris, Caesars, Flamingo, Planet Hollywood, Mirage, Treasure Island etc end. The strip is only 4 or so miles long however with traffic, lights and roadworks going on itll take you an hour and a half to get from the Mandalay Bay to Freemont Experience. Same as last year, we tended to get the free bus to the Bellagio area and back and a taxi to the top end of the strip (south end, Mandalay Bay etc) which cost roughly $12. There is sooo much to do in Vegas and have stayed here twice for 2 weeks both times and have still never seen everything. What we did do is 3 shows and loads of shopping. Mystere @ Treasure Island is a must!!! It was brilliant. Also went to see K.A @ MGM which was still good but not worth the money in my opinion and went to see Steve Wyrick @ Planet Hollywood. He was good and quite funny. All in all great value for money and cant complain really.

We were skeptical but we decided to give it a chance after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor. Let me tell you - this is one hidden gem! This is a fantastic hotel with a clean atmosphere, tons of things to do, and at a price that can't be beat! The hotel features a newly renovated front casino exterior, but the actual hotel (usually not pictured) is older and dated. The rooms are a great size and include everything you need. The bed and room decor are quite modern and tastful. The television was a standard CRT tube but we didn't watch any. The hotels are almost the size of some suites, featuring a full bathroom, 2 beds, television stand, dresser, and night table. The rooms also have a nice sitting area with a loveseat and coffee table and chair, which is a nice touch and gives you an idea of room size. The hotel features a number of reasonably priced franchise restaurants, including Subway, Sbarro, Fuddruckers and Seattles Best Coffee Shops, amongst others. The Subway and Fuddruckers open 24 hours a day, which is nice for a late night snack. There is also a buffet for $7.99, which features a large selection of average buffet foods. There was nothing spectacular but also nothing that I disliked at the buffet. Other restaurants include TGI Fridays, the Prime Rib Loft, Big Al's Oyster bar, and Courtyard Cafe. A lot of selection for a relatively unknown hotel! I have a couple of complaints about the hotel: When we arrived we were met by a front desk clerk who was relatively cold and unfriendly. I find that this is an immediate turn-off, especially because they are the first face you see. Secondly, there is no free internet in the rooms. As I've written before, this bothers me because its a feature that so many other hotels offer at no cost. The hotel does offer free internet at Seattles Best, which was nice because I was able to enjoy a decent coffee and do my work online in a good setting. Overall, I was very happy with this hotel and would stay again.

The Orleasn was just what I was looking for. a good mix of locals and down-to earth tourists, no flashy wanna-be high rollers or anything. There is a huge bowling alley if you like to bowl, open 24 hours. Restaurants are OK, but I would go else where if you want high end food. The salon is decent, gave me a great haircut for cheap. Didn't go to the pool, it was too cold out, but it looked nice. The shuttle to the strip is a nice option, rare to have a free shuttle in Las Vegas. Seamless (strip club) is right accross the street and turns into a night club around 3 or 4 AM. Seamless is a great club, nice girls, plenty of them, cozy and intimate. Just hit up the bell desk for some free passes. The rooms were large and clean, had a nice little corner lounge with couch and cofffee table. The casino bars are all great, very nice bartenders that will give you free drinks if you chat it up with them.

I told the clerk that I did indeed have a confirmed reservation and was told that the person made a mistake. They only reserve a room, not a type of room.

I was told that I was displacing someone else. The first clerk had told me that it was first come first served on rooms. However, it was 3:30 and all rooms were gone???

I relied heavily on TA forums and reviews so here is my contribution. First, our approach to the trip was to take a few days as a family, trying to balance kid-fun with some nightlife for mom and dad, all on the cheap. In retrospect, the correct hotel choice was key. After eliminating the Excalibur and Circus Circus, I ultimately decided between the MGM and the Orleans. The Orleans was a fraction of the cost ($150 for 4 nights!) plus the bowling alley, movie theater and free shuttle to the strip. These features and the good reviews here were the reason I chose it. I was never disappointed and neither was my wife nor my kids 15, 11, and 9. The only criticism I have is that I had reserved a non-smoking room many weeks in advance but upon arrival I was told there were none available. In fact, there was none available for days. Walking up to the room I was certain the smell would be overwhelming and certain to make us all nauseated. The reality was that the room had a slight odor that the kids didnt even notice. We left a small bathroom window open for the first day and that cleared the slight odor. The room was perfectly fine for 5; clean and comfortable. The only issue was that the sliding door to the bathroom sometimes had a loud, shrill squeek when moved. The kids were not impressed with the TV offering, no kid channels at all, TBS was the only one they somewhat liked. For food, we think we made out very well. The buffet breakfast is $6.50 per person but the 5 of us ate for less than $28 because children 7 and under pay a little less and we signed-up for the casino Club Card which got us discounts for EVERYTHING in the casino. The breakfast was a real deal because we went at 10:15 or so every day and the buffet changes to lunch between 10:30 and 10:45. So we had lots of options and the kids loved it. The food was quite good, but tending to be high carb, high fat. The brunch covered one of our two meals for the day. For the kids' dinner we took advantage of the Sbarro and Subway in the Orleans. $16 for 3 foot longs or $14 for a large pizza, using hotel coupons. We only used a cab once, when we came from the airport ($20). We frequently took the free shuttle that drops you at Bills and never had to wait more than 15 minutes, even when we couldn't make it onto the first bus (they seat 24 and no one is allowed to stand). One problem with the shuttle is that if you want to go to either end of the strip, you have a LONG walk, about 45 minutes from Bills to the MGM/NYNY/Excalibur. Probably longer to the Stratosphere. With a little planning, you can take advantage of the city bus system which runs very frequently and long hours. $4 gets an adult a 24 hour pass, $2 for kids. We took the bus back to the airport, transferring to the 109A at Maryland Parkway. We also went to the Pinball Hall of Fame which would have been a $30 cab ride each way. Using the casino's Club Card we got $10 in slot money, a free game of bowling, and free popcorn at the movie theater. I had a lot of trouble using the free internet at Seattle's Best until another patron told me to temporarily remove the firewall on my laptop. No problem connecting after that. We did check out the MGM which has the advantage of being on the strip. It also took 15 minutes to walk from the entrance to the pool (the same time it takes for the shuttle from the Orleans to the strip). From a room it would have been about 10 minutes but you have to go through half the casino. The MGM is also at the end of the strip so walking from an MGM room to the mid-strip Mirage, for example, would easily take 50 minutes. The Oreans is host to a lot of high school sports tournaments so it was FULL of kids. The fact that it is kid-friendly fits nicely with the fact that it is off-strip. Lots of people question bringing kids to Vegas and if you stay on the strip, its easy to see why. The Orleans is not like the strip and with all the affordable amenities, it really is the best place in Vegas for families.

Now don't get me wrong - this is not a hotel at the uber-level of Wynn, Bellagio, or Mandalay Bay. It's not even on the strip. But the value one gets when staying here (assuming you are not the type who gets full room comp at a high end property) is unsurpassed. The rates for this room are often dirt cheap, with 40-ish bucks the normal mid-week discounted rate - I have had rooms here as low as 29 / night (without players club offers - I have had free nights with offers too.) But this isn't a dive. A locals joint, sure, but probably one of the nicest anywhere. This hotel casino complex is nice and large. It is colorful and has a great vibe. The scary mardi gras heads over the pit are a hoot. This is what Vegas is about! The rooms are pretty nice, kind of basic, though the bathrooms are kind of funny with a weird sliding door. The casino is large, (was at one time the largest in vegas - don't know that that is still true though) and has good restaurants, a large movie theatre, and an entertainment arena. The pool is respectable - much better than the one over at sister property Gold Coast (which is also a decent similar property, but not as nice or large as the Orleans). Prices are surprisingly reasonable for goods within the hotel complex (including a small liquor store, full complement, with low prices). You are I should also mention next door (go out the door on the west side) to the finest Irish bar in Vegas (McMullans). But the O comps some good beverages if youre even looking at a machine - who else among the lower rollers comps Newcastle? Gambling conditions are above-average (but used to be better a couple of years ago). A large and professional poker room in the back serves a notorious shark tank of locals. Serves them unwary newbies I should say. A car helps (easy in and out with parking here despite it's relatively large size), but if you don't have one it's OK because they run a free shuttle to the strip. Not to the airport (almost no casino hotel does that in Vegas for regular people). The hotel lobby is on the smaller side for Vegas, and is really an area just on the side of the main casino - but check in is almost always quick. Locals tip: with a car, try heading North and West for some of the best ethnic restaurant choices out there rather than the overpriced albeit fancy strip.

I reviewed this hotel/casino in April and now find that it has gone way downhill. Over the past decade we have probably spent 15 to 20 nights in this hotel. Our most recent visit was one of our only disappointments with this place. Valets: Don\u2019t\u2019 care about their jobs or doing them well. Not once were we greeted in a friendly fashion, and upon check in were not offered a bellman, I had to get one myself. What upset me about that is that I told the valet who was going to park our car that we needed one, he advised it\u2019d be around \u201c8 to 10 minutes,\u201d then I observed two empty carts heading from the valet area back into the hotel. It was obvious he said nothing to the bell desk, and if I hadn\u2019t flagged one down myself, I wouldn\u2019t have got one. And we\u2019re not cheap about it, I tip $10 when they get the bags from the trunk and another $10 when delivered to the room. After that first day, I just self-parked. Why waste time or money on people who don\u2019t want to really provide any sort of customer service? Rooms/Front Desk: When I booked on line I reserved two rooms, one a king non smoking and another with two queens non smoking. On arrival around 2:30 p.m. (check-in is 3,) we were advised that there were no more king non smoking rooms. In a hotel of 1800 plus rooms, in a city where you know they hold rooms for their high rollers, to not give the customer what was reserved is absurd. The next day they moved us, but that whole process was ridiculously inconvenient. The rooms are becomming run down. Knobs missing from furniture, lights didn\u2019t work, towel bars missing, and backed up, smelly sinks in each of the two rooms we occupied. The queen beds are VERY mushy, king bed was much firmer. It really sucks that they\u2019ve let this place go. The rooms are pretty good sized, but that\u2019s the only really nice thing I can still say. Cleanliness: Again, it seems their staff has lost the desire to work, or perhaps it is one of those \"It's not my job\" syndromes. Example: for two days, there was gum, yes, used gum, stuck onto the down button of the elevator on the 15th floor. When we left, it still had residue on that button. You cannot tell me that they didn't have many of their housekeeping & maintenanace staff walk by or use that every day--I saw them, but they ignored the problem. It is that kind of lack of care on a small thing that indicates how they react, or not, to issues that arise. Fitness Center: Nice, most machines work fine, but wife found the bicycles to be uncomfortable based on a way laid back seat position. I used the stair climber & it worked fine. Gambling: Everything was very tight. The only place we won was playing the five dollar slots, for two pulls, and the second we won we cashed out. Food: Buffet: excellent value in the morning only. Lunch and dinner are NOT worth what they charged. The food at breakfast was the only spread that was fresh looking or tasting. Dinner and lunch were awful; we had breakfast four days in a row, dinner and lunch once each. Fuddrucker\u2019s hamburgers: They serve some unique offerings, such as buffalo, salmon and ostrich. The latter really is good if you\u2019ve not tried it. The only gripe is that the condiment and soft drink area is very small and gets very crowded around dinner time. Room Service: Very fast, had a delicous club sandwich delivered in around 20 minutes, prepared exactly as ordered. Pool: Yuck! Cloudy and highly chlorinated. Too much used beer left in the pool. Nasty! We only swam in there once. Overall: They\u2019ve got some work to do. The place needs better maintenance, and some TLC rather than duct tape and wire. It really is a shame, since the Orleans used to be one of our favorite hotels.

The place is secured, there's all kinds of things for them to do, with a small snack bar, you can authorize a budget for them to eat when they get hungry. There's a big crawl gym with slides, playstations, Nintento Wii stations, all kinds of fun stuff. We also enjoyed the bowling alley, they can put up bumpers so younger kids won't get discouraged by gutter balls. We didn't have time for the 18-plex movie center, but I heard it was spacious. Best of all, the Ringling Brothers/Barnum and Bailey Circus happened to come to the Orleans Arena that weekend, so I got FRONT ROW seats with my daughter!! She had the time of her life!! We didn't even have to take her to the Circus Circus Adventuredome at all during the trip, she had so much fun where we stayed. She even made friends at the Kids Tyme center, they were all crying when the kids had to leave each other! I enjoyed the craps tables, the dealers and boxpersons were nice and friendly, not grouchy like some of the old Stardust dealers. Also, there were several tables open, all with $5 minimums all day/night!! Hard to find on strip or near the strip. Also, the cocktail waitresses were all hot!! Every single one of them, with sexy outfits. Good job of hiring!! The casino floor is a little on the smoky side, so young kids may have to get used to it. My daughter used an air freshener to cover her mouth/nose, but she got used to it.

Well knowing that we were starting off at the Orleans seemed less than delightful considering we would be going to the MB later that week. I didn't expect that I would like the Orleans as much as I did. We paid $39 a night for the room. Check in was very efficient. We were given some really good coupons for the eateries there when we checked in. The room itself was very good sized. The bed was comfortable and the room very clean. They also have a safe in the room as well. I can be extremely picky when it comes to hotel rooms. I was pleased. There are plenty of amenities at the casino and resort. THere is a fuddruckers, Sbarro, TGI Fridays, Buffett (very good with a wide selection and clean!), Prime Rib Restaurant, and a Rocky Mountain Chocolate Store.

We rented a car so my husband drove us where ever we needed to go. However there is a shuttle right in front of the hotel that will take you right to the strip. It seemed like a 5 minute drive to the strip. And let me say that you park right in front of the hotel. No huge parking garages to navigate.

This year a little more of the same, but to make matters worse we had to switch rooms as soon as we got there because of an AWFUL (and I mean AWFUL) stench coming from the room they gave us. It smelled like raw sewage and my wife almost lost her lunch as soon as we opened the door. The front desk guy that 'helped' us had told me that the highest floor he could give me was the 13th floor (ominous beginning) and that he could only face us North and not directly facing the strip (east). There went his tip. Anyway I decided to ask another guy at the desk to switch our rooms and he was a lot more helpful. He actually put us on the 19th floor AND facing the strip. Now why couldn't \"Twinkletoes\" do that for me? Anyway............ When we got to our new room it was o.k. but we could still smell the sewage in the drain when we used the bathroom sink. We found out later from the nice front desk guy that they were doing some \"pumping out sewage\" work and that's about the only explanation we got. We decided to just grin and bear it for the next 3 days since the smell didn't come out to the main room, but I still think that was unacceptable. If I was picky at all, we would have been moving again, but I guess at $35 a night, I decided to heck with it since we were up high and facing the Strip. (Great view at night!)

The hotel rooms toilet has no lock. There's not much selection of food late at night. I believe they only have subway, sbarro, fuddrucker, TGIF and that courtyard cafe.

The rooms at the Orleans are some of the largest standard rooms you will find in Las Vegas. Our rooms were extremely clean upon check-in, and housekeeping did a great job during our stay. The Orleans leaves very little to be desired: great Video Poker bars, low minimum table games, lounges to watch your favorite sports, excellent food options for all budgets and very helpful, kind staff all around. There is a fairly large pool, although this is not a hotel that offers a great \"pool scene\"...definately geared towards relaxation rather than parties. On-site bowling alley, movie theater and food court. For those not familiar with Las Vegas, this hotel is located ~1 mile off-Strip and is considered more of a local casino rather than a tourist destination when compared to the larger, on-Strip properties. A rental car is helpful if you plan to stay at the Orleans and visit other areas of Las Vegas. The hotel runs a free shuttle to/from the Strip and the Gold Coast (a sister property just to the north) from 9:30 am to midnight, daily. This is a great money-saving alternative to a cab ride.

The orleans opened in the mid 90 s in the coast family of properties. It was my favorite place to stay and by all acounts a \" hidden gem \". Since boyd gaming took over this property several years ago it has gone down hill. It is still an O k value but it used to be amazing. now Its very hit or miss. The cut backs are obvious wether its a result of the economy or poor management after my last 2 stays i will not be back.There are far better values with much better service to waste your time with this now mediocre establishment and let me give you my reasons. 1. Valet was once the fastest and best in vegas now horrible at best, and i mean every time 20 min wait min no excuse. and im a great tipper which makes it doubley hard to swallow. 2. service and i mean all service wether it be front desk drink girls or restaraunts etc. mediorcre at best. 3. The gambling staff attitudes are the worst. used to be very friendly now they are inexcusably poor. 4. food from the buffet to the cafe in all eaterys there used to be excellent not just good but great . now the only one that i would recomend is big als oyster bar the food there is still fabulous but the wait staff is exceptionally poor. if you eat there sit at the counter. Food is dynamite.The buffet used to be considered the best value in vegas. now all you see there are hoards of nasty locals feeding their grose kids digusting food for a cheap price. 5. Thats what most of their clientel has become the local dregs hanging about with their kids. Apparantly the orleans is so desperate for business this is acceptable by them. Now im not picky by any stretch but I believe if your going to do something you should give it your best effort. Wether that be running a casino or just acting civil in any social situation that involves a large mix of peolple. The current management and staff have obviously lowered their standards to the great new amway mentality. This hotel was once a great value but is now just a cheap place to stay. Dont get me wrong its definitely not the wost place to stay and it may appeal to you. However for me I have found better values elsewhere that provide exceptional service. the 2 places I would recomend are South Point or the golden nugget. If price is not an issue try mandallay bay( great property). Dont be fooled by places like Bellaio or the Wynn or the biggest joke cesears. Nothing more than people trying to pad their egos with money and trust me ive stayed at every kind of propety in vegas low to high. Once again if you need a cheap place to stay you could do worse than the orleans even if you spent more money.

Have also recently added a small food court. This hotel is really family friendly.

We did have a problem with the room safe not working and needing to be completely replaced the first morning. right as we were going out for breakfast. ($5.00 per day mandatory \"resort fee\" covers this and other stuff so use the safe but check it when you get there to make sure it's working BEFORE you are going out the door ) After over an hour of waiting I was getting irritable and HUNGRY.

Fabulous breakfast the Courtyard Cafe, hotel also has a Subway, Sbarro, Fuddruckers, and more in the foodcourt (cheap eats), also a $7.99 buffet that was good for our next breakfast. There were a couple of other restaurants in the hotel too. Also important to know: In & Out Burger is not too far away either- yeay! Obviously we aren't big on \"fine dining\" because we didn't bring attire for it. You can find that at Orleans too, plus at any hotel on the strip- the large hotels each have several of those. The giant bowling alley looked like fun, had an 18 (?) screen movie theater and pool that we didnt even take time to go see for lack of time, and it closed early which we thought odd. The casino wasn't nearly as crowded as on the strip but we didn't go to LV to gamble anyway so I can't comment on the gaming. Parking at the hotel was free and you could park any place you wanted to, valet service also available. Shuttle was OK for getting to the strip but it's a loooong hike back down there to the one & only stop if you've walked any distance.

If driving to the strip the best way is to follow the street on the westside of the property to Harmon. Turn left and go to Decatur and then turn right. Follow Decatur to Twain and turn right. Follow Twain all the way to you come to Industrial. Turn left and go under the freeway and come to the stoplight. Turn right on Frank Sinatra and then a left on Jay Sarno.

In addition, when you get off of the elevator there are no signs directing you to the appropriate room numbers. There are signs, but not right as you exit the elevator. We found ourselves getting off the elevator and going one way, then another until we found the sign that included our room number. Very confusing! The buffet food is just okay, nothing to write home about. On day two we received a memo in our room stating JAMZ was holding their national cheerleading competition at The Orleans Arena. In speaking with one of the parents, there were over 600 cheerleaders staying at the hotel for the competition. I am guessing the age of the cheerleaders were from five to thirteen. We have three children who are young adults so we are familiar with being around children. However, when we plan a vacation all year and go to Las Vegas, we do not expect Las Vegas to be like Disneyland! Children were yelling and running up and down the hallways. The walkways through the casino were packed with children, many of them without chaperones. When booking our vacation direclty with The Orleans, no one ever told us there would be 600 children staying there at the same time. When I mentioned this to the front desk clerk upon check out his response to me was, \"They have the same rights as you do.\" Yes, but at the time of booking no one ever told me there were going to be so many children at the hotel. Perhaps The Orleans knew if they told people there was going to be so many children staying at the hotel at the same time, we'd book our stay elsewhere??? When I told him we would not be back, his response to me as, \"I am sorry you feel that way, but that is fine.\" In these difficult economic time I guess The Orleans has plenty of business to go around and doesn't need our business.

It was everything that I had wanted out of a hotel. The room was big and clean, had a nice comfy king-size bed in a non-smoking room, and a gorgeous view of the entire strip (from Stratosphere to Mandalay Bay)! Service at both check-in/out and by the maintenance staff was friendly. The fitness facilities are really nice and are included in your stay. Too bad it was too cold to use the beautiful pool! The free shuttle to/from the middle of the strip was convenient and only took about 10-15 minutes. Best of all, my stay averaged about $50 CAD/night with taxes including my stay over New Year's Eve and Day, even after paying for the $5/night resort fee. (I had the Winter Sale special which included $20 Free Play and $20 Free Food Credit.) \"Funbook\" coupons for $10 match play and other miscellaneous things are given during check-in. Freebies in the room include a shower cap, toiletry kit (emery board, q-tips, cotton pads, sewing kit), shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion. The $5/night resort fee includes 10 minutes at the Business Centre daily, coffee/tea, unlimited local and toll-free calls, and fitness facilities/pool. For those of you concerned about past reviews that the safe is not bolted down, I think the Orleans has addressed this problem. The safe that was in my hotel room was bolted down so it was secure - I checked. New Coast Club Members get $5 Free Play when they sign up. Members get $1 off any of the affiliated buffets when they present their Coast Club Card. Members also get 7000 pts the month of their birthday, which is equivalent to $7 cash or $10 food credit. I just celebrated my birthday in December, so not only did I get the Winter Sale $20 Free Play and $20 Food Credit, I got another $5 in Free Play for being a new Coast Club Member and $10 food credit for my birthday! That was a total of $25 Free Play and $30 Food Credit! It's nice to be comped :) FYI - I won about $22 playing the slots using the Free Play! The lunch buffet at the French Market Buffet wasn't the greatest and I would probably only give it 2.5-3 stars out of 5, but the Champagne Brunch on New Year's Day was better and I give that 3.5 stars out of 5. The Main Street Station Hotel Buffet on Tuesday T-Bone Steak Night (4.5 stars out of 5) is so much better than the French Market Buffet, yet is also owned by Boyd Casinos, so I'm not sure why the food isn't better at the French Market Buffet. They should cross-train the chefs and that would make this hotel even more awesome than it already is! The cafe has an all day special of a double cheeseburger with fries for $3.99 that is pretty good (3.5-4 stars). The spaghetti with meatballs and garlic bread graveyard special for $3.99 is not bad either (3.5 stars). I would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to my friends/family. It was not only a big room with a beautiful view, but a great hotel with an unbeatable price and good location close to the strip with free shuttles. Couldn't ask for a better hotel! I've stayed at the Paris twice before (once in a VIP suite with my family, and once in a regular room) and at Imperial Palace in a regular room in the past. I would say the Orleans was a much better experience overall (with the exception of the Paris VIP suite), since the amenities at the Orleans actually surpassed that of the Paris and the Imperial Palace. Paris and Imperial Palace cost more, did not include the gym or Business Centre, and their rooms and beds weren't as nice either. Sorry, I don't remember if they included coffee/tea or phone.

The Orleans continues today to be the best value in Las Vegas - but the new owners have made some policy changes that are angering their guests and will soon drop the Orleans out of the \"Best Value\" level into a \"Sub Standard\" value. For example, they continue to have the largest rooms (925 SQ FT) with 2 queen beds in each for the least amount of money ($35 per night average) but beware what you sign and initial at registration. We were charged a mandatory extra $15 per stay per room for the safe which we did not use and for the shampoo that they say is special. I argued to no avail as they already had my signature and a copy of my charge card. The television service in the rooms has also changed. There are fewer regular channels available to make room for more pay pre view channels. The hotel \"has\" improved the exhaust system to rid the gaming area of cigarette smoke but the food at The French Market Buffet was absolutely horrible this trip. I hate saying that because I love buffets and The French Market was always one of my favorites. It is easy to see that the quality of food products has deteriorated. For example, the meats at the carving stations have a lot more fat content, the seafood is smaller portions with more bread coating to make it look larger, the deserts are less than grocery store quality, the restaurant was only 2/3 filled but service to clean tables was slow leaving guests in line longer than usual. These issues will likely send me back to a resort on the strip for our next trip. Why should I continue to pay extra for a rental car for the off strip Orleans Hotel if the food is so bad I have to go somewhere else to eat meals and the extra expense at check out is nothing short of extortion?

Service, rooms, buffet and restaurants were always good, and the low prices made it a great bargain, but no longer. The Hotel & Casino (and others owned by the sme chain)were sold last year : Coast Casinos sold to Boyd Gaming.. Differences now: The front desk registration staff is less xperienced, less capable: We had reerved and prepaid our room, two queen beds non -smoking. they offered us one king bed on a smoking floor. It was only after much time and seeing the hotel manager that they put us in the room we had originally reserved. The Buffet, previously excellent, was awful: meats tough, fish tough and overdone, many dishes tasteless. The Buffet manager on duty (dinner)recognized our frustratin and refunded the charges, and we went elsewhere. We selected the Orleans partly because of its great buffet and its convenience, which now does not apply. I later talked to the chef who told me that kitchen personnel had not changed, and could not discuss why the food had deteriorated. I discussed this with some other guests I met there who been there before, and also told me they were disappointed in the food. Casino personnel were courteous and helpful. the Orlens has added some other food alternatives: Fuddruckers Hamburgers, Sbarro pizza,but we preferred regular meals. Hotel room (14th floor)was clean, no problems.

The Alligator Bar had good service and they were quick to replace my empty beer bottles. I spent a little time at the tables and found I had better luck on the strip. The Orleans uses automatic card shufflers, which I am not a fan of. While this hotel and casino are off the strip, the shuttle had excellent service to Bill's Gambling Hall & Saloon and Gold Coast. The shuttle ran every 15 minutes from 10:30am until midnight; only a few times it was almost full. If you get tired of The Orleans and the strip, get off at Gold Coast and check out the Palms across the street. There is really nothing within walking distance of the hotel except a strip club which is directly across the street. Thus, I would advise not walking around, especially at night. The hotel grounds are safe, but it is kind of located in an area where the streets aren't lit too well. Overall great value.

I was in Vegas at the time and had my husband reserve this offer same day over the internet. Checked in at around 1 p.m. with no wait. In addition to the food voucher and slot play they also gave me a coupon sheet at check in with bogo free drinks and bowling, $10 matchplay, and free appetizer and cocktail (for up to four people) with entree purchase at Courtyard Cafe. I requested a non-smoking king, but they were out so I received a NS double on the 4th floor overlooking the pool. This was my 4th or 5th time staying but the lowest floor I've been on. After checking in we went down to use the hot tub in the spa/fitness center and were told \"the hot tub is closed for renovation\". I was very disappointed with this news; using the indoor hot tub was one of the main reasons I wanted to stay here and the renovation was not listed on their web site. We were also told the outdoor pool and jacuzzi are closed for the season. The only other problem I had was the water in the sink did kind of smell as others have stated. One day I came back to my room and there was a bunch of black residue in the sink, so I knew it had to have backed up some. I ate in the courtyard cafe using the free apetizer/cocktail coupon. For a prime rib dinner with jumbo shrimp cocktail and soda the total with tax was only $12.88. The prime rib was thick cut and everything else was good too. The coupon would have been an even better deal if traveling with others as it was good for up to 4 people. I also ate at the French Market Buffet for breakfast. Their buffet has really cut back on the variety of foods available for breakfast and only served the basics, along with fruit, cereal and danishes. They do still have the omelet/egg station, but there used to be a lot more choices. Overall, the Orleans is still a great choice. They usually have good rates and big, clean rooms.

We have always found it to be a good value given the location, accomodations, restaurants, and other amenities. In our years there , we have had no major problem. I am writing because we just returned from the Halloween weekend and would like to mention a couple of things. First, one night we were woken up at 3 a.m. to the sound of what sounded like a loud buzzing, an almost electric vibrating sound. it seemed to be originating near the door. I inspected the area and found that it was actually air currents passing between the door and the jam. The weather stripping in that area was vibrating due to the high winds that were passing through the hall. We endured that situation through the night, not wanting to bother the maintenance people so late. Next morning I called the front desk to inquire about it, and they actually were not of much help. They told me that it happens to a lot of rooms when the outside winds start to kick it up currents are drawn through the elevator shafts up to the floors, causing the doors to vibrate?... Anyway, they told me to stuff some towels under the door to keep the winds from coming through. I don't know if it helped because the winds died down the next day. Secondly, think this hotel strives to provide everything that the average visitor might need on location so that they don't have to go any place else.. ,Restaurants, spa, theatres, bowling alley, arcade, gym, pool, etc. I think their goal is to keep you on site so you don't go and gamble at another hotel. None of these facilities are top rated, just adequate. That's just the way it is given the cost of things , and the fact that they really can't specialize in any one thing...It's okay, most travelers aren't going to need the higher end stuff, Lots of hotels don't have half of the stuff that the Orleans has. If we want first class stuff, I guess we book the Bellagio , Wynn, or the Venetian..... ka-ching $$$$ So I guess I'm saying that we'd go back unless we find a better value someplace else...

We are in our mid 30\u2019s and have travelled quite a lot, including Las Vegas 3 years previously when we stayed at the Luxor. Here are my thoughts\u2026 We arrived at around 7pm on a Thursday evening and the check in queue was short and the line was quick. I tried the $20 trick (where you slip a $20 bill under your credit card as you pass it to the clerk for ID) and asked if there were any non smoking, high floor, recently remodelled rooms available with a good view of the strip. The clerk saw the 20, grew a big smile, took it like lightning, quickly glanced from side to side, and said that she would be sure she could find us something which we would be very happy with! Success! The room was fabulous, very big and spacious and exactly as I asked for with a great view of the whole strip (in the distance). First thing we noticed about the room was that there was absolutely no evidence of smoking. There was no stale smoke smell which was perfect, and the general cleanliness of the whole room was absolutely spot on. There were only about 7 coat hangers in the hanging area (sectioned off next to the bathroom) so I called housekeeping and asked for 10 more which were brought to our room within 15 minutes. Heading down to the casino for the first time was quite overwhelming as it\u2019s a huge place. We wandered around to get our bearings, had a few drinks, and played loads of slots for a few hours. However, every time we sat down at a machine and touched the metal part we were getting a static shock. After about 50 of these I was getting really p*ssed off and decided to change my shoes thinking it may have been a footwear related problem. Nope, still getting them! Aaaaargh! This was to be the pain of our holiday \u2013 static shocks almost everywhere at every machine, in every casino! The only place where I didn\u2019t get them so bad was in the Palazzo casino. Does anyone else get this? Or is it just my wife an I?! Anyway back to the review\u2026We ate at Don Miguel\u2019s restaurant on our first night which was pretty good. Usual standard Mexican food but the salsa (which came with the complimentary tortilla chips) was just the best tasting we ate anywhere in Vegas! There are a number of other restaurants and food places in the hotel but as we ate out most of the time, we only managed to try the Orleans French Market Buffet and Subway. The breakfast buffet was easily the best value for money that we found anywhere, and the quality was good. We ate breakfast most days here, apart from once at Planet Hollywood, where we found that the price difference was huge but the difference in quality and selection was only minimal. Stick with The Orleans buffet for breakfast and you wont go far wrong! Also, if you sign up for the Club Coast players card you will receive $5 worth of free slot play and a $1 discount per person each visit at the buffet, making it the best value breakfast eats available. Also with your Coast Card you get a 10% discount at the hotel shops including the gift shop. Back to the room again: the furniture wasn\u2019t worn (as some reviewers have stated) and the yellow/gold patterned carpet looked quite new with only a few minor stains here and there. The artwork on the walls was good and colourful and there were lights and lamps everywhere! The seating area close to the big window was nice and we had a full size French style couch (finished with wood detailing) and an armchair to relax in. The large air conditioning unit worked great but woke us up during our first night as it\u2019s quite noisy. Not being able to find an off switch anywhere, we called maintenance who came first thing the next morning. The guy told us to change the control panel setting to \u201ceconomy\u201d and this would switch the system off until you change the setting again to auto, slow or full. Problem solved! Some people on here have expressed disappointment with the walls being thin but I\u2019m glad to say that we didn\u2019t experience any problems with noise at all \u2013 not one bit! Once the door was closed we didn\u2019t hear a peep from the next room either side nor from the corridor during the whole time we were there. A couple of things which my wife asked me to mention was that there is a small patterned window in the bathroom high above the end of the bathtub which you could open wide and let in some fresh air which was nice. Also she liked the fact that the cups in the bathroom were quality plastic cups which were single use (disposable) and sealed, so nobody had used them before. A coffee maker in the room with a range of different coffees and disposable Styrofoam cups was also a bonus. The distance to the room from the casino was easy and made a nice change - when we stayed at the Luxor previously it was about a 20 minute hike to the room from the casino which got really annoying after a few days. I\u2019m glad to say The Orleans was completely the opposite. One reviewer on here mentioned that it was hard to find their room each time due to lack of directional signage. Again, we did not have this problem \u2013 there were more than enough directional signs and even a floor plan guide posted on the wall close to the elevators. Another thing, which a previous reviewer mentioned, was about getting dressed up for dinner. I must admit, I did experience what they said in that if you do dress up in your best stuff and look smart, then you will feel a little out of place sometimes in here. This is because most people at The Orleans wear casual stuff like shorts and t-shirt throughout their whole stay including on an evening. The pool was ok, but didn\u2019t find it was anything to write home about. There were plenty of loungers and free towels available for guests to collect as you enter the pool area. 2 pools, one shallow kiddies pool and a larger main pool. The problem with this area is that the big hotel towers block the sun so there is only sun on the main pool itself for about an hour per day, no good for sun worshippers! This issue may have been increased because we were visiting in October when the sun is lower in the sky, I\u2019m not sure. Another thing which was a little annoying was the plant area for the giant air conditioning chiller units which service the hotel was right next to the pool terrace, so you could hear a permanent constant noisy \u201chummmmmmmmm\u201d throughout the whole area. Certainly not very relaxing when you want to chill out at the pool. Back inside the hotel\u2019s hulking cavern of a casino, there were 5 separate bars (all very much the same) dotted around the casino floor, with the biggest one being in the middle next to the sports book with a small comfy seating area with tables to one side to enjoy a drink. The best thing about staying at The Orleans was that everything inside was very well priced. The bars all offered bottled beers for $1.50 and spirits with a mixer for $3.50. This is a world apart from buying drinks at some casino bars on the strip where you would easily pay at least $8 per drink. There was also a small cabaret lounge where there were live acts on nightly, mostly a band playing with a singer. An additional bar was located at Brendan\u2019s Irish Pub which was over in one corner close to the buffet. Disappointingly it lacked theme and seemed just the same as every other bar in the casino. You could tell it was a kind of half hearted attempt at an Irish pub with a little wood panelling here and there but it was just a bit boring. Worse still, they killed it by having Karaoke on all the time which just drives people out! Never saw more than a few people in there. If you want to visit a real Irish pub, just next to the hotel across from the shuttle bus pick up point, is McMullen\u2019s Irish Pub. We visited there and enjoyed some drinks in a lovely atmosphere and very authentic d\u00e9cor, just like in Ireland itself! The shuttle service to and from the strip was very convenient and was a great way to save money on paying inflated taxi fares. On the couple of occasions when we were unable to catch the last shuttle back from the strip at 12.30am, our taxi fare was around $14 inc a $2 tip. The shuttle was never full and ran every 15 minutes during the day and a little less often on an evening (probably about once every 20 mins). It was a quick service and the bus drivers sure know how to put their foot down and get you there quickly! The only small issue we had with this service was that it didn\u2019t actually start until 9.30am. So some days when we wanted to be up and out early to the strip, we had to get a cab. Overall, yes The Orleans is predominantly a locals hotel and there are not a great deal of tourists here, but it\u2019s a very, very affordable alternative to the sometimes extremely expensive strip hotels. It\u2019s a great place to stay and I\u2019m sure people would find it just as nice and if not better than a lot of the places on the strip. I mean, look at The Tropicana for instance \u2013 this place is the pits, it\u2019s on it\u2019s knees and is beyond refurbishment! The Orleans is ten times better, and way cheaper too! If you are looking for a hotel with loads of facilities, big clean rooms, a good theme, well priced food and drink, a huge casino with a wide choice of gaming, and a price which will not break the bank \u2013 then I\u2019m sure you wont go far wrong with staying here.

One of the best in the holiday and not expensive. Also ate in TGI Fridays and that was good as well. Did not try the other places there to eat. The Shuttle Bus to the strip worked well \u2013 the longest we waited was about 10 minutes either way and it drops you off diagonally opposite Bellagios, so very convenient. Self parking is a bit of a walk but once you know where you are going it is acceptable and there is a moving walk-way going to the parking lot. The worst thing was parking to check in as the spaces are very limited. As there were two of us it was OK as I checked in and my partner waited in the car for a space. There is a time limit I think 15 minutes to the spaces so one soon becomes available.

Food service for the meeting was outstanding, and we tried a wide variety of offerings for continental breakfasts, lunches, and one group dinner. The sales, banquets, and business center staff were all very helpful and accommodating. Front desk staff was not very accommodating, at all. We had a relatively small group compared to the number of rooms in the hotel - so, although sales and banquets treated us as an important customer, the front desk treated us more as an annoyance to their day because of the special meetings rate under which they had to book us. For organizing meetings, be sure that any special deals or concessions are in writing. Communication among the departments of the hotel is not great, and memories of phone conversations are very short. We did have a few problems that way. Overall, we were happy with our meeting here. Be sure attendees understand, though, that this hotel is not in the middle of the Strip. If they expect to be in the center of things, there may be some disappointments. Only real complaint is that, while the rates for everything were overall very good, there were phantom charges and extras that we did not have any reason to expect. Even with those extra charges, though, the place was still a relative bargain for Las Vegas. They could easily have increased rates, overall, and eliminated the extras - we would have been happier dealing with the staff, and the hotel would not have lost out on the revenue. Overall, we would go back for a meeting. We do intend to go back for a vacation.

Entering the room we were pleased at the size and there was no cigarette smell at all:_) the room(standard) was clean and just a tad bit dated. However it was functional with a pretty nice size bathroom that was really roomy. Although we are NOT gamblers in any way, we still enjoyed some of the other things Vegas had to offer. We took the hoover dam mini tour and we were blow away. We also did the madam tasaud's exhibit at the Venetian.....what a waste of $ just my personal opinion. Being that we are from N.Y. and there is a 3 hour time change we didn;t get to do all that was on our \"to do list\" We did see a magic show, the siren show at T.I. and other small attractions on the strip. And we visited just about every hotel on the strip and ooh and Aaah at the shops. (LOL) In conclusion, my thoughts of visiting Vegas for the first time is to be totally prepared to bring your most comfortable footwear. Be prepared to be chase down by pushy time share folks all over the strip who promise to get you into a show for free. (don't fall for it) and taking a cab will cost you a grip with cabbies who claim \"mam....I know a shorter way to get there\" a bunch of bull!!!! it cost me $30.00 to go to circus circus to visit. Will we be back???? that's a very big maybe. I realize by taking the monorail will save you the agony of painful blisters on your feet when walking to the strip in 108 degree weather:_( all in all we enjoyed our selves.

The restroom is a little strange, with the closet by the sink and a really heavy slidding wood door. The little window in the shower was neat. My room mate was a smoker so I could open it up and send the smoke out and it was nice to let the sun and fresh air in while having a shower. The front desk staff, buffett staff, cashiers & housekeeping are all super nice. I had a 2nd floor room facing the pool. It was quick and easy to get to the casino, shuttle & food. the shuttle came often and most of the drivers were fun and funny. The slots were loose at night, very tight during the day (for me anyway). The casino was busy during tournaments & weekends, but the rest of the time I could get the machines I wanted. I am a super low roller and have a budget of $100 per day. I ended up spending $300 on penny slots & walked away with $400 over all, so up $100 there. The pool area was nice, lots of shady places under the palm trees, but too many kids in the pool for me. The service at the pool bar was unfriendly, so I tipped accordingly. The buffet. I personally like quality over quantity so this buffet was a little lacking for me. The roast was typically overcooked and grisly & the choices were limited to tacos, overcooked pasta, pizza & overcooked corn on the cob. However, the salad bar was fresh and good, lots of fruit available and the dessert bar was great. Stay away from the eggs benedict, not good. The convenience store was open 24 hours and has everything you may need including advil, gum, soda & snacks. Since it only take 2 minutes to get there from your room it truly is convenient. The liquor store is fantastic, great prices and 10% or 20% off with your club card. No need to go off resort to get your liquor or beer. We got a free breakfast/lunch buffet coupon for signing up for the club card. TGI Fridays was over priced for mediocre food. When we checked out the \"Resort Fee\" that everyone complains about didnt exist & we were not charged the $15 per day for our fridge, Saving us $100 on that alone. The Business Services room was great, I went daily for my free 10 minutes of internet, never had to wait and the staff there were great. I have been back for 2 weeks and I have already received promotionals for $99 for 3 nights plus entry into the slot tournaments, so my low roller status actually means something to them.

Immediately upon entering the hotel lobby, the smell of cigarette smoke was overwhelming. My eyes started burning and tearing up after just a few minutes. Check in was quick-about 5 minutes. I requested a quiet room and was accomodated. I proceeded to my room on the 19th floor (out of 21 floors). The hallway carpet was grossly stained. However, I was pleased because the cigarette smell subsided once I entered the elevator. The room was adequate- a good size for Las Vegas. It had a loveseat and 2 chairs. Thank goodness the bathroom has a small window that opens for fresh air. Without that, I would have checked out after the first night. There was a small coffeemaker and a safe. The tub was larger than normal. I ordered room service on my second day there. Big mistake! I routinely order room service at most hotels I stay at and this was by far the WORST. The chicken smelled bad. I took a few bites and it tasted as if it had been sitting in a warmer for 3 days. I soon got a stomachache and decided to only eat the baked potato and dump out the rest. I got the feeling they don't serve much room service. Some good things about the Orleans. Every staff person I came across-with the exception of the poker room-was pleasant and friendly. There is a free shuttle that runs every half hour to the strip and drops off across the street from Caesar's. This is a very good thing because when I took a cab from the strip -Mirage- I paid $15 before tip. The cab fare from the airport was $21. If you are renting a car it is fine to be off the strip. The food at the Orleans was cheap, but you get what you pay for. The spa is a nice addition. It has a sauna and jacuzzi. Also, internet access is free for 10 minutes daily. This allows you to print your boarding passes for your flight home. The hotel also has a movie theater and childcare center as well as bowling alley.

I\u2019ve been going to Vegas for years and have always stayed on a strip property. However, I\u2019ve grown tired of trying to find tables with less than $15 minimums (especially on busy days/weekends), so on the suggestion of a family member, I decided to stay off-strip this time and after looking at reviews here and doing my own research, I chose The Orleans. It was a good choice and I just completed my second stay there in a month. The Orleans is located on Tropicana Blvd., about 2.5 miles west of the intersection of Tropicana and Las Vegas Blvd where the New York New York and MGM are located. It is NOT within walking distance of these locations, especially in summer. The Orleans offers a shuttle service that operates every 20-30 minutes and takes you from the Orleans to the Strip \u2013 it drops you off outside of Bill\u2019s Casino on the strip when is across the street from Caeasar\u2019s Palace. Anyway, I would recommend forgoing the shuttle. I was there in March and April and while it was not hot during those visits, I could see in the summer where waiting for the shuttle out in the heat (with no shelter to cover the sun) would be less than pleasurable. I took the shuttle once and it was OK \u2013 full, but I\u2019m more of an instant gratification type of guy and didn\u2019t like having to wait about a \u00bd hour each time (even though those timeframes are clearly posted by the hotel \u2013 so not their fault at all). It\u2019s just so much easier to grab a cab and pay the $10 - $12 fare (includes tip) to the strip. Then do the same on the way back. But, the shuttle is a nice, clean option for those who do not want to use a cab. Check-in on both trips was very easy. Only a slight wait the first time and there was no wait this last time (Tuesdsay, April 22). On my first Orleans stay in March, however, I did notice a couple of times while gambling that there were quite long lines at check-in, but they seemed to be moving. Greeted with a smile and asking my room preferences both times. Both times they assigned me to a room exactly as I asked, including a high room, away from elevators. Rooms were clean, though basic and somewhat dated. But I wouldn\u2019t expect more for the outstanding rates offered at the Orleans. This past stay, my rate was $49/night for 3 nights. I received a room with two queen beds, a small sofa, a chair and a desk chair, a desk with a chair and an armoir that held a 25\u201d standard TV (not plasma or LCD) and room for most of your clothes. The bathroom is a little different. A sliding wood door is what separates the bathroom from the rest of the room and takes a little getting used to, but is otherwise functional. The bathroom set-up is very basic (like the room itself) but contains everything you need. The only thing that I would suggest to the Orleans regarding their bathrooms is to supply a soap dish to hold the used soap. It just feels very Motel 6ish when you have to put your used soap directly on the sink because there\u2019s nothing else there to put it on\u2026 The water pressure in the shower was always fine and water temperature from very cold to scalding hot was always available. The shower even has a small window that opens slightly. Back to the living area \u2013 the beds are very standard, basic beds \u2013 which means either quite hard or quite soft. The comforters are dated (ugly, actually) and I strip them off the bed anyway before sitting on the bed for a number of reasons I\u2019ll let you figure out. The pillows provided are totally insufficient and very uncomfortable. They are very small, routinely flat you receive two of these on a queen bed and three on a king size bed. You will want to call housekeeping and have them bring you at least two more. The carpet is garish (a yellow, red pattern), but seemed clean. All in all, if you are one to simply use the room as a place to sleep after a long day of gambling, eating and drinking, it\u2019s just fine. If you\u2019re looking for a little luxury because you spend most of your time in the room watching TV or reading, then you would probably want to stay somewhere else. For me, it\u2019s perfect. The issue of the in-room safe: yes, they provide an in-room safe large enough to hold my laptop and several other items. The bad news \u2013 it is not secured to anything. It sits atop a shelf in the open closet area of the bathroom. I did use it, however, to hold my valuables since I had no other choice. It is a little disconcerting, though, to think that someone could simply walk up and rip the safe\u2019s cord of the wall and walk off with it if they were so inclined. They really should bold those down to the shelves. Also, wireless internet connections are available in the rooms and the cost is $12.99 per 24 hours of use. The signal was strong and the connection was fast. Both times, my rooms were very quiet. I rarely heard neighbors and the noise from outside was minimal. The hallway carpets could use a good deep cleaning \u2013 stains were evident along the yellow edges of the carpeting in the hallways. Elevators were never a problem. Never had to wait long for one and they were never so crowded that it was uncomfortable. Good mix of all age groups represented at the Orleans. 20s and up. Very few kids. Music in the background on the casino floor is always \u201880s top 40 type of music \u2013 doesn\u2019t stray much from that genre though. The place, for me, where the Orleans really shines is its\u2019 customer service and casino area. Every employee I ran across greeted me with a \u201chello\u201d and a smile. There is a security guard stationed near the elevators and they all had a smile and a \u201cthank you\u201d for showing your room card. Most of the dealers, bartenders, and cocktail waitresses are very friendly as well. The hotel has a really good restaurant selection (seven or eight of them) and I\u2019ve eaten at all but a couple. I will alert you, first, however about the buffet. Each night is a \u201cspecial\u201d night and Wednesday nights is prime rib night. I might well have been the worst prime rib I\u2019ve ever had. Very overcooked, tough and colorless. The remaining selections were merely average. Price was $15 and for the $15 you can get a much better meal somewhere else in the casino. In fact the prime rib at the Prime Rib loft was very good. I enjoyed the shrimp cocktail and Boston clam chowder at Big Al\u2019s Oyster Bar and had a lunch special at Koji\u2019s which was average. I ate many meals at their \u201cdiner\u201d style restaurant called the Courtyard Caf\u00e9. Good selection at very reasonable prices and always good sized portions and quite good. Service at all restaurants was always very friendly and quick. No complaints at all with restaurant service there. There\u2019s also a TGI Fridays inside when has it\u2019s traditional menu. All in all, I will stay here again. It\u2019s the best of both worlds for me. I avoid the crowds and noise of the strip, yet I\u2019m close enough that a $10 cab ride gets me over to the strip (which I did a couple of times) if I want that vibe and energy (and other gambling options) and all at room rates that are generally excellent.", "Date": "April 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fayetteville, New York", "Title": "\u201cBad Odor...

Went back last week with several family members and had the worst hotel experience in my life, bar none. Our first room was fine when we checked in (around 10:30 am). There was a note in the room saying that the water would be shut off from midnight to 6 am. Before returning to our room (around 11 pm) I requested some bottled water, since the water would be shut down. I was told I'd have to pay for it. I could hardly believe it. It did not end there. We finally got the water and when we got to our room and opened the door, we were almost blown back into the hallway by the sewer smell. The air was thick and the sink was full of sewer backwash. The staff at the Orleans refused to give us a new room. They sent someone from engineering who stuffed the sink full of chemicals, so now we had a room that was full of sewer and chemical smell. It was definitely not fit for human habitation. The people who came into our room all agreed that they would not stay there, but would any of them help us get a new room? NO! After more than an hour of back and forth between supervisors we finally got a new room (an ADA equipped room). Apparently, that was all they had open on a Wednesday night. Needless to say, this room was better than the last, but the smell coming from the sink was still bad. I was afraid to say anything, for fear that they'd come put in all those chemicals again. That was even worse than the sewer smell. So we kept the bathroom window open and made sure the bathroom door was always shut. It helped. We had 4 rooms booked there and 2 were real stinkers. The other 2 weren't bad. But one problem that we all had was from drinking the water (or possibly the ice). Out of 8 people in our group, 6 got sick. I got seriously ill. We are all convinced that it is the sewer/water problem at the hotel. The sad fact is that the staff at the Orleans plays dumb about all of this. I have since searched and found other complaints regarding this, so I know it's not the first time they've ever heard about it. I also contacted the Clark County Dept. of Environmental Health who inspected and said that it was a violation to shut the water down without notifying them. The supervisor at the Orleans told the DEH that it was done on an \"emergency\" basis and that's why no notification was given, However, we checked in at 10 am and found the note then, so they had time.

The last thing I wanted to do after walking all over the strip is walk a mile through the casino and another mile to our room. Make sure that they put you in a room close to the elevators. The room was open and not cramped but the smell of smoke was overwhelming. We were in a non smoking room but the stale scent of cigarettes filled the room. It must be due to poor air circulation in older casinos. The only thing that helped was the fresh air from the small bathroom window. We kept it open the entire time. We did order room service one evening at about 2am. It was affordable, quick and very good. The pool area was nice. It had a bar. The hot tub was large and had waterfalls. There a palm tree in the center. The only problem is that children flock to the hot tub. There was a sign posted for children under 12 not to use the hot tub. Nobody from the hotel was there to enforce it. I got several mouths full of hot tub water from inconsiderate youth.

One toddler pool, one longish one and a huge circular hot tub...beautiful. On our last day we came up from the pool and we had no water in our room. We called and they explained they had an emergency and the water in our entire tower was out for about 2 hours. My husband quickly called down to the Spa/Fitness Centre and they said we could use the facilities no problem !! It is part of the resort $5 a day fee you pay ! Make use of it folks !! Gorgeous facility ! Besides the huge shower stalls it had a sauna and a huge whirlpool with nobody in it ! Free use of the toiletries and they had ice cold water in the fridge !! Anyway, we came back to our room and still had no water. My husband called the manager and left a voice mail about his concerns since we were on our way out to a formal dinner and still couldn't use the water. The next day when we checked out the manager had credited our account with one free night stay !!! We thought that was acceptable since it was a hassle going to the spa to shower ! ( even if it was a nice spa ! ) We also rented a car from Budget which was conveniently located accross the street. The hotel gets a better rate for you, so go through the Bell Desk . Took my son to Gameworks which is an awesome arcade on the strip next to MGM. Paid $35 for a day pass. HE DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE EVEN AFTER 5 HOURS. So we took him back after dinner for a few more hours. Great games for all ages. When we did take a cab from the hotel to the strip we payed about $10 mid day.

I have never in my life seen so many kids in a casino in Las Vegas.

We drove to the hotel on Sunday at about 4 PM. It was easy to get to from the airport. Unfortunately, there was no designated spaces for hotel guests to unload their luggage in front of the hotel. The valet guy told me that we could park by the curb at a spot across 5 lanes of cars from the hotel front entrance, and unload our stuff, but we had to give him our car key (in a sense, valet parking) unless at least one of us stayed with the car during our registering. I did not want to pay for valet parking just for registering and unloading our luggage, so I parked at the spot he pointed out, went inside the hotel myself to register while my wife and my son stayed in the car. As soon as I entered the hotel, I smelled cigarette, which was stronger than I expected, because the registration counter is on the fringe of the casino area so that the smoke generated by smoking gamblers was distributed all through the ground floor. The cigarette smell was barely tolerable. Las Vegas appeared to be the cigarette smoking capital of the U.S. because every where I went on the ground floor of each of the Las Vegas hotels and the areas outside the Las Vegas hotels, I ran into people smoking. I had to wait only 5 minutes for my turn to register inside the hotel. The woman who checked me in was friendly. AFter I had gotten my computer card room keys, I returned to our car, unloaded the luggage and told my wife and son to wait by our luggage outside the hotel. I then drove to park in the parking lot of the Orleans Arena next door to the hotel. I walked for about 8 minutes back to the front entrance of the hotel to meet my wife and son, and proceeded to our room with our luggage. Both my wife and my son commented how strong the cigarette smell was in the \"lobby\" of the hotel. The elevators to the rooms were located about 5 minutes walk from the hotel front entrance, on the fringe of the casino. Thus, the Orleans Hotel is not as bad as the large hotels on the strip in terms of the distance from the hotel entrance to the elevators to go up to the guest rooms. After getting off the elevator, it was quite a walk to our room because our room was near the end of a very long hallway. One thing I noticed was that there was no cigarette smell in the hallway and in our room, as if the living quarters and the ground floor casino were in two separate buildings served by two separate air conditioning systems. When we walked from the elevator to our room, I saw that the carpet lining the hallway had obvious stains in a number of areas showing that the carpet really need to be replaced. But we were happy with the cleaniness of our room. We were given a strip-view non-smoking standard room with 2 queen size beds. The room was very big. Having stayed at a number of hotels in both coasts, I would rate this room to be the biggest standard hotel room we have stayed at. The view of the strip also was nice. However, the brass collar of the lamp next to the window was broken. I informed housekeeping of the problem and they said they would send an engineer to fix it. We went out for dinner. We did not eat at the hotel that night. But several people we knew ate at the buffet restaurant at the hotel that night and told us that the food was not very good. When we got back to our room that evening, I saw that the engineer had put a paper tape around the broken brass collar of the lamp to hold it up. If I were the engineer, I would have replaced the lamp or at least fixed it with an insulating plastic tape. Being very tired, I did not complain to housekeeping about the quality of the repair, figuring that we were just staying for several days. I merely told my son to not touch the lamp. My wife took her shower and told me that the bath tub did not drain water very well. Because we were too tired to call houskeeping, we went to bed. The beds and pillows were average in terms of comfort, but the bed sheets were too small for queen size beds. The air conditioner was rather noisy. But we got used to it quite soon and fell asleep without any trouble. The next morning, I took the shower and found that the water rose to about half an inch above the bath tub drain during the shower so that there was a pool of water where my feet were. The water was hot enough and the water pressure was quite good. After the shower, I called down to housekeeping complaining about the water drainage problem and they said they would send an engineer to fix it. I put $3 in an envelope marked \"House Keeper\" next to the TV and we left for sight seeing. When we returned that evening, the bath tub drainage problem had not been fixed. In addition, the housekeeper did not replace the plastic water cups and the paper coffee cups that we had used. I called housekeeping complaining about the water drainage problem again and told them to send an engineer the next day to fix the problem. The second morning, I once again left $3 for the house keeper and went out for sight seeings. When we returned, the drainage pproblem stayed the same and the water cups and coffee cups were not replenished. I called housekeeping complaining about the drainage problem again. The person who took my call recognized my voice and said that she would write a big note for the engineer about it. I requested that she sent the engineer the following day to fix the problem. We went downstairs to meet up with 4 people we knew for dinner at the Prime Rib Loft (sort of on the second floor of the hotel) without any reservation at about 7:30 pm. Because the Prime Rib Loft was connected to the casino without any wall, I noticed that the cigarette smell in the Prime Rib Loft was stronger than that in the casino. It might be because cigarette smoke rose in the air so that the smoke was more concentrated in the loft than in the casino downstairs. The hostess told us that there was no open table for 7 at that time and we would have to wait till 8:45 pm for the next table. With the cigarette smell being as strong as it was, we did not want to dine there. Instead, we went to Canal Street downstairs. Canal Street was a restaurant inside the hotel at the fringe of the casino area. Because Canal Street was connected to the casino with a closed door, the cigarette smell inside Canal Street was much lighter than that in the casino area or the registration area. We had prime ribs and sea bass, which were very good. The service also was good. The third morning, I did not leave any money for the house keeper because I was not happy with the house keeper's repeated failure to replenish the cups in our room. We went out for sight seeing again. When we returned later that afternoon, I found that the drainage problem stayed the same. The situation was worse than the last two days in that not only did the house keeper not replenish the cups, she also did not leave us with a fresh roll of bathroom tissue. Because I did not notice the lack of bathroom tissue until the fourth morning, I called housekeeping and told the staff only about the unfixed drainage problem and the lack of water cups. She offered to send an engineer up right away. But I told her to not bother because we were checking out the next day anyway. I told her that if I were to do my job the way the hotel engineers did theirs, I would have been fired long time ago. She also wondered how their engineers do their jobs. I told her I needed water cups. She said she would send someone to bring us new water cups. When we returned to our room after dinner, we saw a stack of about 10 precious, plastic water cups in our room. Finally, at least one of my complaints resulted in a resolution of a housekeeping problem. But before my stay at the Orleans Hotel, I did not know that plastic water cups could be that precious. When I got up the fourth morning at about 7:30 AM, I noticed that the house keeper did not leave us any fresh roll of bathroom tissue. My patience was running out, I called housekeeping and demanded that someone bring us bathroom tissue. She said someone would bring us the tissue shortly. But it was not until about 8:10 AM before a woman brought us two rolls of bathroom tissue. At 8:17 AM, somebody knocked at our door. I recognized that it was a house keeper because every morning at about that time in the past several days, a house keeper (not the same one every morning) had knocked at our door. I could not figure out why the house keepers wanted to wake hotel guests up so early every morning. May be they were too anxious to get the rooms clean early so that they could go home early. But with patience running out concerning housekeeping of the Orleans Hotel, I opened the door and asked the house keeper what she wanted. She did not dare to tell me that she wanted to clean my room at that moment. She also did not apologize either. She just walked away and knocked at the door of the room next to us. I poke my head out in the hallway, raised my voice at her and said: \"It is only 8:17 AM, for god sake!\" She looked at my direction with an facial expression that told me that she most likely did not understand what I was saying. To not waste time, I closed my door, took my shower and packed for our trip home. The check out went smoothly. I only had to wait 3 minutes for my turn at the check out counter. In my opinion, the Orleans Hotel definitely has housekeeping problems. But if all you want is a hotel at a low rate, and you are willing to put up with the housekeeping problems, I think the Orleans would work for your stay at Las Vegas. Its room size and low rate could not be beated by any strip hotel.

The room had 2 queen beds which were very comfy and a 2 seater sofa, chair and coffee table. The bathroom was very spacious, had a shower over the bath and was very powerful. The standard of cleanliness was exceptional. The towels were large and fluffy and the complimentary toiletries were of a good standard. The room was very quiet and we never heard other guests. TIP-Always place the \"Do not disturb\" sign on your door otherwise the maids knock you up at 7am to clean the room!. The shuttle bus was great, very frequent and drops off at the side of Bills gambling hall which is about the middle of the strip. We never waited more than 10 mins . The facilities in the hotel were more than adequate. The $5 daily resort fee (per room) includes 30 mins internet access (in the business centre nr reception) however I ewas on much longer somedays and no one ever said or charged me anything! and free use of the gym, and free local telephone calls. The choice of eating places within the hotel are good. We ate at the Courtyard Cafe and it was very good. We only played the slots as we dont have a clue about gambling! The cocktail waitresses were much more frequent in taking orders in the casino in the Orleans than any other casino we visited. The pool area is really well kept and a lovely relaxing environment, and provides free towels. Only residents can enter the pool area. Security guards are always sat by the lifts and no one can get up to the guest rooms without showing their key card. There is a great shop within the hotel where you can purchase toiletries, gifts, and snacks as well as alcohol at terrific prices. A chilled bottle of decent rose wine was only $4 !

This fee also covered local phone calls and coffee maker and computer useage in the business center. They said you got 30 mins of free computer use, but DH went waaaayyyy over that time and they didn't say anything. The room itself was nice and clean, and my DD was wearing white socks and they were still pretty white after her walking around the room. Yes, the bed was a bit hard, but clean. We had a n/s king, with a desk and a sofa and an another chair with a nice coffee table. Bathroom had nice goodies. Shampoo, soap, conditioner, lotion, shower gel AND mouthwash. Shower cap too! The safe was in the bathroom and it was plenty big and secure for our electronics. We had a nice view of the strip. Although, I would try to get a room a bit further from the elevator, because we had some drunken fight going on around 4:45 am - ugh. Housekeeping didn't quite understand when we said we only needed shampoo and a few towels, she kept trying to make up the room. If you sign up for their club card, you get a coupon for a free breakfast or lunch buffet. The breakfast buffet was pretty average, powered scrambled eggs, and an busy omlette station. I was impressed with the sweet potato pancakes. Parking was a bit difficult, but I attribute that to a large convention and valet wasn't bad. I would say this is a hotel that is good for someone who is in Vegas with wheels. The shuttle drops you off at Bill's (formerly Barnaby Coast) across from Caesars. The wait for food at TGIF was a bit much. Apparently they had a brand new menu and was still learning how to cook it. Never got a chance to try the slots. The line to check in was pretty good when we checked in, but when we were going to check out late Sat afternoon, the line was long. Apparently, they have a bowling center and a child care center that guests can use. Our DD was too young, must be 2.5 and potty trained, but it may be helpful for others.

The price you pay to take a taxi to where you want to go from the Orleans added to the the large amount of money you save when booking this room still comes out much cheaper then staying on the strip. You can still spend your time on the strip in those hotels during the day and not pay the huge room fee for staying there. The Orleans does have a free shuttle, but we did not try it. We arrived late on a Thursday night and had to wait about 10 minutes to check-in. The room we had pre-booked (King nonsmoking) was not available, but they gave us the offer to switch to 2 queens n/s with a better view. That was fine. The room had a safe plenty big (laptop fit inside). They have a business office where you can use a computer (charge per minute and to print). We just wanted to print our boarding passes and after we used the business office, I noticed a machine you could use (for a fee) just for boarding passes and check-in just off the main casino on the way to the elevators. It was a busy weekend (Nascar) but we could always find room at a table game (even the $5 minimum black jack). The hotel had a live band each night. They did cover music (70s, 80s, 90s, current) and it was very good. The 24 hour courtyard cafe was excellent for breakfast and either no line or a short one when we went. Don Miguels had 99 cent margaritas and half price appetizers from 2-6. This was a great deal. The appetizers are very good and big enough for a meal. We spent a total of $12 and got 2 margaritas, nachos and queisedas. The sports book is nice enough. We had planned to go to another hotel if we wanted a nicer one, but it met our needs. You have to pay $2 for the Daily Racing Form, but if you turn it back in when you are done, you get your $2 back. Check out was easy and we never had to wait in line to catch a taxi. We didn't swim in the pool (still a little early in the season), but we went out to look at the area and sit in a chair and it seemed like a nice pool area. Our room was cleaned promptly each day. The toilet, shower and bathroom mirror and sink area is all one, so it kind of stinks if someone is going to the bathroom, you can't really be in there doing your hair/make-up or whatever. It also used a sliding door to the bathroom area which wasn't the greatest. The shower was nice and hot and lots of water which is always important!

Regular rooms are 500sqft with writing desk, separate seating area with easy chair, three seat couch and marble table, plenty of storage, conventional TV in armoire setting, king or two queen size (very comfortable) beds, bathroom with hanging storage, granite counter tops, separate toilet and shower, sliding door to main room. Only a couple of criticisms : Pillows are particularly poor. Air conditioning is stand alone under the window and noisy - no problem in winter but can be troublesome otherwise.

And then there was the Wireless Internet for $12 a day. Just be prepared to get about 5 minutes of normal usage out of it before you will spend hours of not getting a signal, or if you do, losing it consistently. Our record had to show about fifty to seventy times of logging onto the server on a daily basis. All of these attempts in the name of finding a sporting event that was not listed in the local directory. Want to check your emails? Forget about it! Just check them when you return home, on a SECURE server! It was Thursday morning now and we placed another call to the front desk because the HVAC system was extremely loud and noisy. We were again, privy to not only one, but two separate maintenance crews that morning. We finally had a \u201cnormal\u201d HVAC system for Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Too bad we checked out Monday morning\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 While Checking out Monday morning, we were never asked if any of our issues were resolved to our satisfaction. We were not compensated for the $48 wireless charge which only gave more than 20 minutes of continuous uninterrupted service on Saturday between 4am and 6am. The rest of the wireless experience was an embarrassment to the Boyd\u2019s Gaming chain! We were not offered any discount for housing some of the hotels staff for two mornings, while addressing a problem that no guest should ever have to. We are shocked and very disappointed by our treatment and the condition of the Orleans in this day and time. I don\u2019t if we will witness an implosion of it from our local newscast anytime soon, but that was the LAST TIME we will set foot in that place again ever! We come to Las Vegas 3 times a year. We know a lot of people who know we visit that often for so many years now. When they ask, they will be told to avoid the Orleans at all cost unless you\u2019re just looking for place to flop-out for the time you will spend in Vegas to party. And party hard! By that last and closing statement, and this is not a lie, someone turned to hallway outside of our room into a toilet. Yes, the number two was in the entire \u201clounge seating area\u201d right outside of our door!

Let me start with the bad stuff. Only 18 of our 50 states are totally smoke-free and I live in one of them. I can't take the smoke at The Orleans but that's a personal issue and the only negative thing I have to say about The Orleans. The good stuff. 1. Our room rate was under $40 a night. I understand this is a special rate offered between Thanksgiving and Christmas which is the slowest time of the year in Vegas. Call the hotel they will tell you about it 2. The Orleans offers one-stop vacationing under one roof. 3. There is an 18 screen movie theater with the latest releases. We saw I Am Legend which was released December 14, 2007. 4 There is a bowling alley-I don't bowl, can't vouch for this 5. There is a Chinese restaurant with the best won-ton soup (get the big bowl size) and a happy hour where the appetizers are reduced by 50%. 6. There is a day-care for your children and an arcade-can't vouch for these I didn't use them. 7. The elevators are fast I never waited more than 45 seconds for an elevator. I was on floors 1-9 8. Decent view in rooms numbered 01-45, even numbers only, For instance room 638 and 606. You get the mountains and a view of the strip, although there is a parking lot right below. 9. VERY LOOSE SLOTS!! This place is frequented by \"the locals\" and I now understand why. The Orleans was running local television advertisements promoting the \"loosening of their penny slot machines.\" It's true; the people I was with were winning in the hundreds of dollars on penny slots!!! 10. There are several different restaurants in this entertainment complex;: there is a buffet, a prime rib loft, Al's Oyster Bar, which features these big bowls of seafood dishes; I recommend the Gumbo and the Seafood Cobb Salad, TGIFridays, Ice cream, hot dogs/hamburgers, tand the Courtyard Cafe with the best link sausages. 11. This hotel is not for the \"shee-shee- boo boo\"crowd, but The Orleans is not a flea bag either. Standard Room size 450 square feet!!! This is with a King-size or two queen-size beds. 12. Housekeeping did a good job. I never ran out of soap or towels. 13. The gift shop is open 24hours a day. They have gifts and goodies to sell. 14. Express check out is available and can be completed via the telelvision screen. 15. There is a free daily shuttle that takes you to and from the strip should you just have to go there. It runs about every 20 minutes. Make sure you get the shuttle going to The Orleans, check with the driver before boarding. 16. There is a $5 per day resort fee that covers all local and toll-free calls made from the room. The use of the internet and free printing in the business center. I was even given colored paper upon which to print! 24-hour access to the fitness center, and the use of the coffee maker in the room. 17. This place is safe for single women, that would be me. 18. Pool and jacuzzi are outdoors and open year-round. Okay I\"ll stop now. I can't say enough about The Orleans. Going here is the perfect Christmas/Hanukah/Kwanzaa gift.

But look again! You get one heck of a deal in the price and they throw in so much. I stayed there a couple of years ago and wanted to stay on the Strip. Higher prices made me look at the Orleans again and I'm glad I did. Last summer, I stayed here mid-week for about $ 54 a night. The reception is big hotel Las Vegas style...efficient, polite and not exceptionally friendly. The lines are too long, so they have to keep moving you through the cordoned area to check you in or check you out. So you have to understand that. The rooms are GREAT! I got a higher floor this last time with higher ceilings. The room decor is unbelievable for the price...normally, you would get a Travelodge for this price. The door handles shaped like alligators are hilarious, but once inside, it's a seriously comfortable room. A few times, I decided to snooze on the bed to get my energy and wound up sleeping a little longer, it was THAT comfortable. One weird thing about the room shape: generally, bathrooms are at the entrance to a rectangular shaped hotel room. Here, bathrooms are on the outside wall, adjacent to a sitting area. That's fine...it just means your bed won't be near a window. Different, but not offensive. They charge a nominal \"resort fee\" and kick in the local calls AND use of the health club, which is pretty darn nice. Many other Strip hotels charge $ 10 to $ 15 to use the health club/spa, and that's without any services such as massages and therapies. Disadvantages are few. Obviously, it's off the Strip, so you will have to have a car or rely on cabs. I always rent a car so I walk through this mammoth property to the parking lot or parking structure and go where I want to go. The biggest disadvantage was the food that I got to sample: in my pack of coupons was a reasonably priced dinner buffet which I patronized one night. It was very poor. Oh yes, there was food in abundance, but the quality of the dishes was absolutely dismal. Bleh! The expensive buffets at the Strip hotels are much much better and worth the additional charge.

Housekeeping was excellent. I personally was on the 5th floor and found the hallways and wait area outside the elevator to be very well kept. I did notice many of our group was on the 2nd floor (a smoking floor) and the halls to have soiled carpets. Used the spa on the second day and it was very lovely except for the people working on the drain in the womens shower area. The spa desk person failed to mention that a man was back there and me and my three guests put on a little unitentional show for them. You would have thought someone would have informed us that he was back there. When I complained the second maintance person told the front spa person that she should have cancelled all the treatments for the day. The desk person said it was to late and that we would have to change in a treatment room. Being that the spa has limited hours...shouldn't they have done this work during the night? The maintance man told us they knew the day before of the problems with the drains and that someone should have had them in there during the night. Oh well, massage was great and just went to my room to take a shower afterwards. The area was impressive and would most likely use it again upon return....if there are no maintance workers hiding in the shower. Kudos to the woman at the Spa desk...she was sooo very friendly and apologized for the trouble. Her friendly manner kept us from demanding any comps for our inconvience. Ate at TGIF and the buffet. Not bad...not great. Was really wanting to eat at Canal Street like we had on our last visit but the staff was rather rude when we arrived at 9:30 to try and eat. They said they were closing and acted put out if they had to seat us. Closing time is 10pm (early in my opinion for vegas standards) We chose to eat at TGIF. Drink service for games was actually pretty poor in some areas, but once one finally came around and served you and you tipped well...they came back quickly. Found the casino to be clean and a fun atmosphere. Not overly smokey like some casinos on the strip. The security at the hotel elevators was nice. Used the shuttle to the strip a few times and it was quick and efficient. Very friendly drivers!! Front desk staff was very nice and helpful..even with the above mentioned snags...they went out of their way to help. Business center had an employee that doesn't seem to like her job.

It was a pretty good deal overall, though soured somewhat by the hotel charging a $5 a day RESORT FEE for all rooms. This supposedly covers in-room coffee, use of the fitness center and a couple of other minor things, none of which I used. Travelocity did not disclose this fee specifically, but I'm sure they've got some blanket disclaimer saying it's a possibility (as Priceline does). While I realize that it might still be a decent deal at $30+ taxes, this kind of practice by places like the Orleans really deserves pushback from travelers. Otherwise the hidden add-ons will only become more numerous (remember \"energy surcharges?\"), more costly, and will reach the point where rate quotes over systems like Travelocity become so irrelevant to what you really pay that they're just a form of bait-and-switch. It's also patently unfair to other hotels in Travelocity that play it straight and DON'T charge hidden fees like resort fees, as their offerings should get better play because of a cheaper all-in price but don't. This encourages the more-honest operators to lower their standards and adopt others' bad practices \"to be competitive.\" That's how these things fester. If the Orleans really needs the extra money, then it belongs in the base rate. As for the hotel, the rooms are basically OK even though some are far from the elevator bank. The casino used to be one of the best places in town to play Pai Gow poker, but they've upped the table minimums to $10 and I didn't see any $5 tables anymore.

Although it's true that they don't give out the funbooks at check in anymore, everything else is exactly the same.

It only holds about 18 people, so does fill up quickly. We just used taxis. They cost about $10 to MGM. Not bad at all. As for the restaurants, we found the buffet to be good value, although the food was not exceptional. The Courtyard Cafe served very nice breakfasts. And the dinner we had at the Prime Rib Loft was very good & surprisingly cheap. We used the cinema. Movies were about $10 per show.

Furniture in the sitting room area needed cleaning. Maid-service was attentive and quick to deliver extra pillows we requested by leaving a voice message - 10 minutes later they were delivered. TV reception was marginal, but I guess they don't really want you to sit in your room watching TV. We noticed the gaming channels (horseracing, etc.) came in crystal clear. Had late lunch one day at the Courtyard Cafe. Prime rib sandwich was decent, nothing special. Service was slow. Smoke permeated the air, there was no escape in the open-air environment. I noticed lines (LONG) on Sunday to most all the restaurants and even the quick-take-out places. Beware of remodeling - Gift shop closed for remodeling while we were there - open one night, presto it was closed for the next 2 weeks. Courtyard Cafe is open but several walls hidden under blue tarps. Poker room is also under renovation and looks to be about half the space of normal - tables were jammed together in a small area. The biggest mistake we made is flying in and not renting a car. We could have driven and parked in the lot (ample space and FREE). There is a Budget Rent A Car right across the street on Tropicana, would have been an easy rental location. Think we paid about $15 for the cab ride from airport to hotel. Free shuttle leaves something to be desired. Yes, it's free, but it does not appear to run on any predictable schedule. Makes the first stop at Gold Coast (another Boyd Gaming location), and then we sat for literally 10 minutes while the drivers changed shifts. Drop-off at the strip at another Boyd location across from Caesar's Place. We tried to take the shuttle back but finally gave up waiting (lines) and took a cab back - another $15 ride. Pool area is nice, it was rather deserted when we were there. The sun does not hit the pool until noon and the water was quite cool. The hot tub was warmish. Not being gamblers, we were looking for things to do. Watched a first-run movie at the on-site theatre (Cinemark). Walked across the street to a Irish pub. Had a smoke-free lunch across the street at Panda Express. Visited the attached Arena for the K-9 police competition. We were ready for the weekend to end. When will someone have the smarts to open a NON-smoking casino? This place is like the rest I have visited. Smoke fills the air and there is no escape.

We were looking for something new as we'd been regulars at a strip hotel for over 14 years. The Orleans was certainly a nice surprise. The food was great in every restaurant that we tried, The Prime Rib Loft, Canal Street and Al's Oyster bar. The cafe was a good way for us to start each day. Lunch at Terrible Mikes and the Sushi bar were both super. The service was excellent on all counts. Room service was good and quick. All the restaurants were reasonably priced too. Actually they were cheap by Las Vegas standards. We found friendly employees throughout the casino. Usually a sign that the employees like their jobs and it showed. Security at the elevator doors was nice. We arrived on an early flight and the front desk allowed us an early check in at 9:15AM. That was a nice gesture but they put us on the 2nd floor with a view of the delivery docks below. It was a little noisy in the mornings during delivery time. We assumed that issuing these rooms to early check in was the only way they could fill them? Being able to check in 5 hours early made it worth while it to us. We've been to Las Vegas more than 100 times and we've seen the lights plenty of times over the years so we had no problem with the view. The casino host offered to move us but we declined. We were guaranteed a nicer room with a view next trip out. The rooms were large and clean. The carpets looked new, the furniture was well kept and looked fairly new. Big bathroom with a safe up on a shelf. We hopped a cab and ventured to the strip. We were let off at The Excalibur and the fare was only $7 plus tip. There is a free shuttle bus to the strip that runs on a regular schedule if you should choose. We come to Vegas to gamble, eat and see shows. We like to be around people like ourselves that come to Vegas to have fun. The Orleans casino was full of them. Friendly dealers made it all that much nicer. There were even plenty of $5 BJ tables which my wife liked. Most of the BJ games were 2 deck pitch. There was only a few 6-5 single decks (which we would never play) and some 6 deck shoes. Keno was available throughout the casino and in our room on Ch.11. The six crap tables were the long tables which I prefer. The sports book was crowded on Sat. and Sun. but well organized which made the long lines move very fast. The Orleans has a nice arena (saw George Carlin Sat.) and they get some great entertainment. In our estimation, The Orleans would be geared towards the 35 and up crowd. If you're looking for a Caesars Palace type hotel, this is not the place for you. But, if you want a good bang for your buck, then you'll stop looking after you've stayed here one time. All in all, we have found a great place to stay for a long time to come.

We checked in on Sept. 3rd. First of all, the property is fairly large and the area where you park to check in is a little crazy, so it might work out better for someone to drop off the person checking in and circle back around and pick the person up. Watch out for the valet attendants because they will not allow you to park temporarily. My husband dropped my FIL and me off and we went in the front door to check in. The line was only four deep and there were quite a few front desk clerks working, so it didn't take that long to actually talk with someone. The man that helped us was from India or a middle eastern country, so we had a little trouble understanding him. He was not friendly at all, so our first impression of The Orleans was not the greatest. This was our first time staying at this hotel. The clerk didn't give us much information other than they put a $100 hold on your credit card for incidentals at check-in. We had room 1399, a non-smoking king bed at the very end of the hall (we asked for rooms close to the elevator for my MIL). The room was nicely furnished with a very spacious bathroom. There are neat etched windows in the shower. They do let in a lot of light at night, which is good for a night light, but bad if you like the room dark. You just need to close the sliding door at night, but, remember it's closed as you stumble to the bathroom in the middle of the night! The bed was comfortable, even though the foam mattress was in need of replacement (see photos). The bathroom does not have a exhaust fan, so the room got a little humid after a shower. There was a hair dryer, ironing board and iron. The a/c worked well. The room appeared to be really clean. I really liked the decor and the wrought iron window design. The whole place really reminded me of The French Quarter in New Orleans, so they did a good job of replicating it. One thing we were not told about upon check-in, and we only found out when we pulled up our charges on the television, was they charge a daily resort fee. The website said they charge a $10 fee to use the workout facility and pool, so my husband didn't use it while we were there for the tournament, only to find out on the last day that we were charged the fee anyway. This was very upsetting since the front desk clerk didn't mention it, nor was it printed on the offer card we received for the tournament. The tournament was very well run. They provided soft drinks, water and coffee for the participants. They stayed on schedule for the day. It would be nice if the tournament were two days instead of one since we were there for three nights. We dined for breakfast at the buffet while we were there using a buy-one, get-one free coupon from the American Casino Guide. I would not recommend the breakfast buffet. We had eaten there once before and the quality seems to have gone down hill since then. We checked out on the television, so that was very easy. Parking is a problem at this place since you must walk a long way to and from your room. My MIL has a pace maker and heart problems and it was really hard for her. We will definitely stay at this hotel again if they offer us another special room rate. The location is great if you have a car. It isn't within walking distance of the Strip, unless you're in really good shape. I wouldn't recommend walking at night. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Among them, Harrah\u2019s, Stratosphere, Casino Royal, The Hilton, The Fitzgerald, a Hampton Inn, a Condo, and even a motel once when we got bumped from a flight. As you can see, it has been a variety, from nicer to whatever was available. Some of these I have stayed at several times, with inconsistent results in my experience. Not so with The Orleans. I have yet to have a bad experience there, and this stay was no exception. I now travel to Vegas 5 or 6 times a year, and The Orleans has earned it place as my first choice when I start looking for a place to stay. They offer great promotions, that when taken advantage of make the rooms some of the most affordable I have come across. The rooms are spacious, clean, and well laid out. I like that the bathroom is in the far corner of the room for example, not right there as you walk into the room like most hotel rooms, which always seems so crowded and awkward to me. In addition, the bathroom is such the sink/vanity area is separated by a wall from the toilet and shower/tub. This makes it so much easier for one person to shave etc, while the other is taking a shower etc, without having to be right next to them. In addition, the room even has a sitting area, which I must admit I rarely use at all. Let's be honest, we do not go to Vegas to hang out in the room. That being said, I still want a room that I feel comfortable in. The Orleans certainly offers that. They also offer room safes at no cost, although on this last stay, for some odd reason the safe was not bolted down. While that may not be \"safe\", it might still look odd if someone were walking down the hall toting a safe. I do hope that in the not too distant future, they switch to those wonderful foam type mattresses that others are going to, as my back could use it. While The Orleans is not right on the strip, it is very close. It is very close the The Rio as well. The Orleans tries to offer a lot of variety in an effort to give you a reason to stay there. Large casino, theater, bowling, several restaurants, poker room, most everything you could want. They do have bars, but no hot spot night club, but again those are only minutes away. I really enjoy The Orleans. While no one is perfect, they make an effort to maintain the property, which is more than I can say for several others that seem to be in a constant state of decay.

I called down to the front desk area, and explained that we didn't get our coupon booklets. We were then informed that the hotel was out of coupon books. Initially I understood that untimely things can happen, so I asked if I could somehow get the discounted coupon items honored without having the actual coupon. I was told no, it was not something they could do. I then asked, what could be done. I was then told there is nothing that could be done. I then asked if there was someone available to could do something to accommodate us. The woman then stated that she was the Director of Hotel Operations. I then stated, then if anyone could resolve the situation I would be her. She then explained that the 2 complimentary drink coupons were given to accommodate us.

We wanted to take advantage of the activities without having to leave the hotel (movies + bowling). The Tropicana had the same exact hotel rate as The Orleans, but we chose them anyway. In my mind, there are some things merchants shouldn't run out of, but if they do they should be better prepared to accommodate their guests. We are not high maintenance travelers. All we wanted to do was take advantage of the discounted bowling and movie opportunities that were in the coupon book. We were saddened when we didn't get a coupon book upon check-in, but we were extremely disappointed the the service managers/ director was not willing to help us out at all.

I was surprised that there was not a water-saver shower head, but we enjoyed the powerful stream of water and the hot water never ran out. (We didn't abuse that.) There is a little window that can be opened to let the steam out. They have the most up-to-date safe we have seen and there is no extra charge to use it. There is also no extra charge to use the very nice fitness center. I think that is smart business. You see the spa as you make your way to the fitness room and maybe you will decide to make use of that too. The pool area is also very nice. The buffet is a good value. We have eaten at most of the buffets in town. Some have more upscale food for a more upscale price, but this one is very good for the price. The gift shop has a very nice selection. We even went to a movie in the theater on the premises. The only small complaints we had were that the pocket door on the bathroom did not slide smoothly and the room is not too soundproof, but we wear ear plugs so did not mind the noisy kids and drunks in the hallway. It is Las Vegas, after all, so one would expect that.

We love to stay here. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. The casino is large and gives you plenty to choose from in the way of gambling. They also provide a lot of food choices. The cocktail service is also pretty good (some places in the casino are not that great). We were on an invited offer this time, so I went to the invited quest line since the other line was very long. There was a gentleman checking OUT in this line and he wanted certain items taken off of his bill. It took a long time to help him. The other line moved much faster. They had about 7 clerks helping the other line. The closest desk clerk should have seen what was happening and should have started calling over the invited quest line. The person behind me was so upset. They were former Stardust guests and were invited to come to the Orleans based on their play at the Stardust. She made the comment that The Orleans was not starting off for her very well. There was also an older lady that came up and asked me if she could step in front of me when it was my turn because the check in clerks had given her the wrong key for the second time. This poor woman looked so exhausted. I felt sorry for her. When I got to the counter the clerk appologized for the wait. I could tell it wasn't her fault and told her so. She sped me through check in and had me on my way. I received a very bad view (the other two views we have had were of the mountains - this over looked the roof of the casino) and a double bed (was supposed to be king). The view wasn't such a big thing, but I did miss the king bed. I didn't want to stand in line again, so we kept it. This did not ruin my stay by any means, but didn't sit well with me. I know I could have changed it, but after waiting so long the first time I didn't care to go back down. From my experience and listening to others in line, the Orleans needs to improve their check in service. I also do not like their $5.00 resort fee charge. I don't like to drink coffee from those small coffee makers. Isn't that good and is not worth $5.00. Charge more for the room if you need to do so, but don't tack on dumb fees. Because of the Vegas heat, we took advantage of the pool this time. While their pool isn't the prettiest Vegas pool, it is nice. It is large which is nice since there were a lot of children there. It gave them lots of room. If you have to go to the restroom you have to go all the way back in the casino. I don't remember having to do that before. There looked like there was some construction going on right by the doors to the pool, so this may have been where the bathroom was before (or will it will be after they are done). Running all the way back into the casino in your suit is not convenient. We ate at Al's Oyster Bar this time because we had a dining credit. The food was good, but the staff seemed to be irritated. Not just one of them, all of them. One of the cooks got into an argument with a customer right in front of us. Then later one of the waiters got into an argument with two of the cooks which ended up getting another waiter involved. I will say the casino seemed much tighter this time than it has in the past years. New ownership? Who knows. Will I stay at the Orleans again? Probably. It is still a great value.

In addition, there is a movie theater, a bowling alley, a liquor store, and enough restaurants and bars to keep you full and wasted until it's time to go home. Overall, the staff was pleasant, though one particular bartender I encountered seemed a bit surly when I tried to redeem my free drink coupon. Otherwise, check-in was quick and everyone was friendly. The bargain room comes at the expense of some niggling details. First of all, the casino sometimes lacked cheap table games, which is something The Orleans - a \"local\" casino - is supposed to be known for. If you are looking for a $5 blackjack table, you might be out of luck, and because of The Orleans's isolated position, it means taking a shuttle to The Strip unless, of course, you have a rental car. (The shuttle is free.) That part was kind of a bummer. Next, because of its massive size, The Orleans always seems packed. In many way, I felt like I was wandering around an airport, and throngs of people moved about with their luggage. In addition, joining the players' club took a half-hour wait in line, something I had not experienced at other casinos. Also note this: If you consider yourself racist of prejudiced in any way, look elsewhere, as The Orleans is about the most diverse hotel and casino I've stayed at. Overall, The Orleans is a good bet. If you value the quality of a clean, almost suite-like room with expensive touches and don't mind the crowds and a relatively subpar gaming area, The Orleans will do you just fine.", "Date": "July 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cLower Price, Have lower expectations\u201d", "Author": "calfly", "ReviewID": "UR8051956", "Content": "We booked the Orleans for 2 nights - we didn't want to spend gobs of $$ on a room when all we required was a place to sleep & shower. We had read reviews by other travelers and thought the Orleans would be fine for our purposes. The \"good\" 1. Price, we were there Thurs & Fri evening - and it averaged about $105/night. Booked thru AAA. 2. Shuttle Service to/from hotel takes you to Strip for free. Convenient! 3. Hoover Dam Tour - a must see while you're in Vegas. 4. Double Room was comfortable for our purpose. 5. Cheaper than the Strip, you get what you pay for. The bad: 1. - Orleans needs to open the doors & air itself out. It had a very stale smell throughout. 2. - I felt like I was at a bowling alley, from walking through the casino to having breakfast in the Courtyard Cafe. When we were there, Courtyard Cafe had a water/flood problem & rather than rope off the area of the restaurant effected, they put us in a booth w/ a soggy carpet below our feet AND they proceeded to wet vac right next to us while we were eating. For a business that is open 24hrs they could have done this before peak breakfast hours. 3. - The staff all seem to be the castaways from the high end hotels of the Strip. Although they were all pleasant, their uniforms & their personal appearance make them candidates for \"What Not to Wear\". 4. - The Pool - nothing fancy, opened at 11am I think. Felt more like a community pool. Lacked \"resort\" qualities. 5. Room - we had view of parking lot. No room safe. Neighbors room service tray sat on floor outside their door for over 10hrs before being removed. 6. Bathroom - no separate shower/vanity area so 2 people can't get ready at once. Clothes closet is in bath. Had a \"Motel 6\" feel to it. No frills shampoo & bar of soap. Low power hairdryer. 7. Needs a major overhaul - dated throughout. 8. Hoover Dam tour - we booked thru the \"concierge\" - took almost 2hrs just to get on the bus at the tour operators depot. We were picked up at Orleans, drove to various hotels picking up others, eventually ended up at depot - where we waited again for other buses. We were then consolidated to one bus & on our merry way.

Our room was on the 12th floor facing the outside pool and could view moutains in the distance, not a bad view. The beds initially felt pretty cheap and thin but we actually slept pretty good. We didn't experience much noise, the room was fairly spacious, the bathroom was much larger than the average hotel and they use name-brand tissue...A small but nice little detail. The room had a digital thermostat and was easy to adjust room temperature. There are 6 elevators and our wait for one was always very short. The swimming pool is fairly large and is about 3.5 ft deep all the way around. We used the bowling center (very nice) and ate at TGI Friday's and it was okay. We did not use the casino because we don't gamble...But for a Casino hotel it's a pretty good place to stay for the family with the bowling center, movie theaters, swimming, ice cream store, Subway, etc. Although we rented a car, we took the shuttle to the strip our first time since it was our first trip to Vegas. The shuttle is quite small and you may be waiting a bit during busy times, especially towards evening. After that, we drove our car to the strip as we found out it's fairly easy to park free at many strip hotels, just look for the signs that say self parking. Getting in and out of The Orleans is quite easy, we just used the free self-parking. Overall, the hotel is okay, especially for the price...We had a pretty good deal. It could use a little renovation, new carpet, etc. but if budget is an issue I would recommend The Orleans.

Not very practical for a couple. The other negative is that they have adopted the new practice of adding a $5.00 per day facility charge like some other hotels have started, This is regardless of whether you use the facilities or not.

My biggest complaint was the bed. The mattress was thin and uncomfortable and the sheets were two flat sheets that kept coming undone=yuck! I know this seems like a small detail, but I was tired by this point in our trip and needed a good nights sleep. Something about touching the mattress when the sheets messed up really grossed me out.

The beds were very comfortable, but the pillows were worthless - so thin, but housekeeping was nice when called to bring up a couple more. All the staff we met were very nice and courteous with the exception of one person working at the bell desk . The others at the bell desk made up for him, fortunately. We ate at 5 of the hotel's restaurants. The buffet had a decent variety, but really great desserts. They even had a large variety of sugar free desserts. The food was great at Friday's, but the waiter was not very accommodating. Subway was good and the Courtyard Cafe had excellent food, but service during breakfast seemed slow although okay at other meal times. The Prime Rib Loft is excellent all the way around. We got in with no reservation and had delicious prime rib and the service and atmosphere were great. We went there 3 times and got a great meal each time for about $15.00. The shuttle to and from the strip was pretty dependable. We never waited very long for the bus either direction. The casino area is nice and large. We found it easy to get a roulette table and there were ample slot and poker machines. I was disappointed to see most of the \"one-armed bandits\" being replaced with the more complicated electronic games, but this is typical now of most casinos and just an era gone by. I can't appreciate the fake sound of coins being paid out of the machine. I did, however win $400 on one of the older machines and spent a couple of days giving it back before I left. I don't know much about getting comps, but read that you should just ask. I asked for one of the rooms I had to be upgraded, but was offered 1 bed when we had reserved 2, so had to decline the $50 upgrade they offered me. The gift shop was stocked with many necessities as well as gifts and I was quite thankful for that when I broke my reading glasses that I am very dependent on. The theatre was very large and very nice. We saw Shrek 3 there along with 4 other people in the same theatre. As expected, the concessions were expensive, but good. There was a smallish arcade near the theatre that was fun. The bowling alley looked fun, but we never found a time we could bowl due to a large bowling tournament going on there. I chose the Orleans Hotel because I thought it was a great theme, but it felt very little like New Orleans once inside. It was pretty and one of the few places in town not surrounded by construction. Overall, my group was satisfied with what our money paid for. The group consisted of my husband and myself, our adult kids, 21, 23 and my 32 year old handicapped daughter and a 21 year old friend of the family.

We got a great rate of just $25 a night from i4vegas which is incredible for the quality of the room and the hotel! The room was large with a comfortable King bed that was a bit softer than last time with a foam top on the mattress. The room was very clean and the only complaint I have is the loudness of the air conditioner in the room but it did work well and keep the room cool considering it was 100 degrees each day we were in Vegas. The cleaning crew did a wonderful job of keeping the room clean and not bothering us as long as we had the tag outside the door that we wanted privacy. We caught the Rick Thomas Magic show and it was a very entertaining time. The white tigers are absolutely beautiful and his female assistants were as well. Because the showroom was barely half filled, the show felt much more personal and a few times Rick came out into the crowd and he involved several members of the audience in his act. A great value for the normal $24.95 ticket price and even better with the 2 for 1 special we got for being guest at the hotel. We really enjoyed having a movie theatre at the hotel and we were able to get caught up on some good movies that came out in the month of May that we hadn't been able to get to at home. And it was never crowded. The buffet was very good for breakfast and that is the only time we ate at the buffet. We did eat at TGI Friday's late one night and enjoyed dessert there and we ate at the Courtyard Cafe after looking at the menu and seeing the chinese food selections. After we saw someone who had ordered the T-Bone steak get their dinner, we forgot about the chinese food selections and both ordered the T-Bone. Excellent quality for a very reasonable price! We ate at Cravings in the Mirage for dinner one night and were a bit disappointed overall for the cost of the buffet. My wife loved the salad bar where they made her salad fresh and I really enjoyed the prime rib but we were as impressed with the quality of the food compared to a couple other buffets we ate at. We ate at the Spice Market Buffet in Planet Hollywood and this buffet is worth every penny! We loved it last year and we were not disappointed this time. Great selection, great quality and it deserves it's reputation of being the best buffet in Vegas. We can't wait to eat there again on our next trip. One other place we ate that is worth every penny and deserves it's great reputation is Todai in Planet Hollywood. It is a japanese and seafood buffet and you can get such a wide variety of sushi as well as cooked japanese dishes. My wife does not eat sushi but there was more than enough non-sushi dishes to keep her pleased. We went for lunch and probably 80% of the clientele at the time we were there we Japanese, so you know it is authentic and good! One other thing we did that was not at the Orleans was catch the Jay White - Neil Diamond tribute show at the Riviera. I was skeptical but my wife and I are big Diamond fans and so we bought half-priced tickets at a half-price ticket outlet on the strip and went to see the show. Outstanding! Jay White made you forget that he wasn't really Neil Diamond and his act was very believable. I would highly recommend this show if you have never seen it before. One thing we really like about the Orleans is the casino. Unlike many casinos on the strip, it is not overly smokey and there are plenty of penny slots. We aren't big gamblers and usually just spend time on the penny slots. We really enjoyed the variety of penny slots available and they did pay well. We probably won around $600 in total though we ended up putting it all back along with about $300 of our own money, but it provided for a very enjoyable time playing the slots. They have improved the process of taking the shuttle to the strip and we were glad about that. Last year, it was a pushing and shoving match to get on the bus but this time they had a roped area that people had to line up in to get on the shuttle. Definitely made using the shuttle more pleasant this time. The shuttles run every 30 minuntes and we always seem to get out to the shuttles just as they were arriving. Each time I plan a trip to Vegas, I think about possibly staying at a hotel on the strip but then I realize that I get such a great value at the Orleans, why should I waste my money staying on the strip? We actually enjoy the fact that it is off the strip and not crowded and you really don't ever need to leave the hotel if you don't want to with the great eating establishments, casino, movie theatre and bowling alley all at your disposal. And the two shows we have caught at the Orleans, Air Supply and Rick Thomas were very enjoyable and reasonable in cost.

We had about 40 guests (all from out of town) who stayed at the Orleans for several days. The pool area was very attractive, and even though I personally did not go swimming, my friends and family loved it. The restaurants were very nice, and there was a ton of variety - a TGIF, a Subway, the Cafe, a Mexican restaurant, and more! We had our reception at Sazio, the Italian restaurant. The food was very tasty and the service was excellent - extremely attentive (but then, it was a wedding party!). I was very pleased. The breakfast buffet was also very good; my father had enough comps to treat five of us! The rooms were nice, but in need of some updating. However, the room service was good and the room was clean. We got new bottles of shampoo, conditioner, etc every day. There is also an iron, ironing board, and hair dryer. Check-in was pretty smooth and easy; we arrived way before check-in time (at about 11AM), but we were all allowed to check-in early without extra charges. The only complaint I have is that there is an extra $50 a day held on your card in case of room damage, I guess. However, this is not very convenient if you use your debit card. Check-out was also very quick and easy. We used the business center to ship some wedding items back home instead of taking them on the plane with us, and we received very friendly and helpful service. We did not have a UPS account, so the clerk told us she could ship our box out with DHL under the hotel's account. It arrived safely in our possession only two days after we got home (in upstate NY). I did not notice the casino being any smokier than other fancier strip casinos - and I am a non-smoker. There were lots of low-limit tables and many slot machines. My fiance won $400 on a slot the first day we were there and one of my friends won over $500 on her last day. The tables had very friendly dealers and they were fun to play at. It was pretty easy to get to the strip - we took the shuttle three times and never had a problem; even with the holiday weekend traffic. I would definately not try to walk it though - way too far. We did not rent a car, but it was still easy to get around - we went to Freemont Street for a day and it was only a few minutes away by taxi.

Our room was in the back on floor 11 and it always seemed to be noisey with deliveries or loud car engines. It wasn't opened long. Air conditioner is noisey as it cycles on and off to temperature, but the alternative is a hot room. One problem was the light to the shower area was out, we hadn't noticed it right away but met the repairman who said it wasn't the light but a switch in the basement that needed to be turned on. Later the first day ,we got a call saying the repairman was waiting outside to see if the light worked. I turned it on and it worked so, the switch in the basement was turned on. How many Orleans employees does it take to change a light bulb, and how long does it take? Check in took about a half hour. Peak time for check in. Slots are very tight. The buffet was good. Had a breakfast and lunch there. Supper seemed to $ for what was there. The dessert area is behind glass, have to ask if you want those goodies. I guess when they left all of the desserts out they went through more. Guilty!!! Also ate at the Courtyard cafe, Seattle Coffee, good for a quick breakfast coffee and crouisants, Also another quick stand near cafe. Ate at Fridays. They seemed to be annoyed we were there. Had to ask for silverware, napkins. We split a dessert and asked for another plate. Boy, did that annoy them. Access to the hotel is easier then the hotels on the strip. Parking all around the hotel not just in one area. Found a shortcut to the parking area. Easier to tote the suitcases. Pool was cold, in and out quick. Jacuzzi was nice and warm. One small store for trinkets. Easy access to the strip. The area by Planet Hollywood is so jamed with construction and messed up. Nice inside sort of sterile.

Palms is a mess with construction. Not much to see inside. Barbary Coast is Bill's Gambling Hall?!?! I always like the name Barbary Coast. SAw Sams Club, nice atrium, sort of a forest area for those who don't like the city. Had a nice time at the Orleans. Don't like the extra $5 charge.

Of the three wings off the elevator, two on floor 21 were gated and reserved for highrollers... our wing was upscale decor but still available to us poorer common folk I guess! lol .. It was fun riding the elevator with a few whales and talking with them!

The ONLY thing that bothered us was the mattress on the beds. They are the foam mattresses, and I don't think they are the high quality memory foam you often read about.

I took one FOR the beauty salon TO the beauty salon and they told me I couldn't use it (because of \"the system\"), so I took it back to the poker room and the clerk wrote on it and said I could use it. I went back to the salon and they did let me use it but, they had no price list or menu of services, they told me that my service would be $35 up front (before I mentioned the comp). After I was finished I gave them my comp and at that time they told me the service was $75 and then they marked it down with the comp?!? Be careful there. I got another one for checkout (which took almost an hour) the clerk said I couldn't use it because I didn't have a balance that large. After I asked a few times for her to check again she did see her mistake and pulled the correct information up. Again, she didn't know how to check us out, we had to wait for a supervisor who still didn't seem sure how to do it. The did let me use the comp but I couldn't use the points from the machines because the \"system was down\". That coupled with the $5 per day fee (5x8 days = $40 EXTRA) really made me feel that I was beeing cheeted. Again, no apology, just an excuse about \"the system\" and \"the new management\". It took much longer than it should have and we almost missed our flight. The first time we ate at a resturant the employees had an argument in front of us while we were eating about how they couldn't clean because the hostess sat us in the wrong place. So, we did not do any of the other resturants at The Orleans this time, but we did go to the snack bar and it was still very good but again, when it came time to pay there were problems with \"the system\". I had a good experience in the casino. I did think the machines were a little tighter this time but the cocktail waitresses were great. They were very nice and attentive. Since we were there for 8 days they remembered us which was nice. I agree with people that say the casino is smokey and I'm a nonsmoker, but I expect for bars and casions to be smokey. This one is not nearly as bad as some. There was a part of the hotel, around the pool door and side parking lot that just smelled like sewage. This was troubeling. The pool is nice but it is just a pool. I don't have kids but this must be a pretty family friendly place because they were everywhere and looked to be having a great time. There were enough chairs every time I went out and towels were also pleantiful. Overall I guess you get what you pay for. It was a good value, but we weren't value shopping. We stayed there because it was so great last time and this time it just didn't meet our expectations and between the problems with the comps and the additional fees I just felt cheeted. I'd rather pay a little more up front. If you're value shopping there are lots of good values in Vegas, I regretfully, have to recommend that you look elsewhere. For us, we will probably pay a little more next time just to have a better experience, it is vacation after all. Aside from the casino, every time we tried to do something in the hotel there was some kind of problem. The employees were not happy, they didn't seem to care. We got excuses about \"the new system\" and \"the new management\" everytime something went awry but no one really cared and this was the most frusterating thing. Of course things go wrong from time to time but as long as the hotel is nice and really wants you to have a nice stay it is okay - The Orleans just didn't care this time. To their credit they did send a survey, while they didn't offer any kind of apology or \"thanks for your business we are taking steps to ensure this doesn't happen again\" hopefully they will listen.

Something has changed there ( maybe the management or the owner?) but it is not at all beneficial for The Orleans. My impression is, that they cut jobs and are now seriously understaffed in many areas. As others mentioned also, I found the slots to be much,much tighter than on previous visits. I still enjoy the location away from the strip, but the shuttle service is somehow very unorganized and the drivers used to be nice and helpful-not this time.

The hotel was full or nearly full each day, so planning saved me quite a bit. Gambling was good for me. I was patient, playing $10-20 a hand at a $5 table and walked away with double my buy in. Video poker was also rewarding overall with several winning hands, but none of the elusive royal flushes I envision. Only one would pay for my whole trip. The hotel was running a buffet promotion offering 75% off to people paying with their casino points, so we ate one night for only a $5 tip. That was a nice way to break in my companion, a Vegas first timer. I cannot call her a Vegas virgin since she is my mom and that makes me shudder to even think about. She was hooked after that, looking for all the free play and 2-1 deals she could find. Hearing her complain on the last day about the lack of luggage space for her freebies was funny. Before the trip, I had reserved an 80-minute massage at Spa Orleans for my mother. She appreciated the special attention the spa's staff gave her. This allowed her to keep up with me for several long days on the Strip. Returning to the late night specials in the Courtyard Cafe ($3.95 steak and eggs!) was a welcome way to end a day. We used the hotel shuttle several times. It still goes to the Strip (stopping outside Bill's Gamblin' Hall on the Flamingo Rd side). The free shuttle is much more organized now. There is a line for people to queue in and the driver drops off everyone before allowing new riders to board. If you have a rental car or can navigate an easy combination of the shuttle and the city bus ($5 all day), the hotel's location is no problem.

I would probably stay there again if there was a deal on or when I'm much older and want to stay away from the crowds on the strip.", "Date": "May 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston", "Title": "\u201cBest value in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "cuckoosnest2004", "ReviewID": "UR7446038", "Content": "The Orleans is the best value in Las Vegas. We stayed there 4/15/2007 - 4/19/2007. I have prevously stayed at Luxor and Aladdin and it is just as nice as either of those. I am influenced by the fact I paid $51/night and received 4 free dinners and 4 free breakfasts as part of my package. My alternative was $179/night at a decent Strip hotel. The specifics: Larger than a basic Strip room, received a Strip view upon request, everything was well maintianed. Note., we leave the room at 8:00 AM and return after midnight, so I am not someone who is obsessed with a luxurious room Casino - great for a low-roller. Always able to play $5 BJ, $5 Craps, etc. Drink service is great, but the the drinks are weak. I won everyday at BJ, broke even on slots, and saw a few people win jackpots of over $1,000. However, my wife lost $600 on slots for the week, so it is no better, no worse than anywhere else. Food - very good for a moderately priced meal. We ate at aladdin's buffet (still the best IMO), and the Orleans can't compare, but it is not bad. Specifically, if you subsist on meat, chocolate cake, and ice cream as I do, you will enjoy it. If you are looking for great shrimp cocktail, crab legs, and seafood, head for Bellagio, Wynn, aladdin, etc. The Orleans is better than Harrahs, Luxor, IP, etc Staff - very friendly and attentive. Some people don't like the fact they require you to show your room key eveytime you get on an elevator, but I have no problem with that. Drinks - as mentioned, pretty weak. I include the drinks I bought at casino bars, not just the complementary drinks. What has happened to Las Vegas. I had drinks at Bellagio, Aladdin, Flamingo, NYNY, and TI this trip and only the Flamingo gave a decent drink - and it wasn't what I had ordered! Shuttle - I never rent a car in Vegas (because I drink) and - yes - the Orleans is not as convenient as being on the Strip, but the shuttles were doable. Essentially, we took them to the Strip once a day and then back again. We also used it to go to the gold Coast - the Orleans sister property. Shows - this time we saw Mystere. I booked online 4 months earlier and got front-row center seats. They involved a few guests in the show including my wife. She ended up dressed like a clown and riding around the stage in a clown car, so my experience was probably different than most people I think it is a very good show, but I wouldn't see more than one Circe De Soleil show because I think they are all similar. We have seen the Rick Thomas Magic Show at Orleans and it is a great way to kill an afternoon if you have kids or get cheap tickets. Overall - If you rent a car or don't care about not being on the Strip , the Orleans is a great value. It's certainly the equivalent of most Strip hotels. If you are a first-time visitor to Vegas, spend the extra $$$$ and stay on the strip.", "Date": "April 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cNo bed bugs while I was there\u201d", "Author": "Randi59", "ReviewID": "UR7432825", "Content": "This is by far the best off-strip hotel I've visited in Las Vegas.

Theme: New Orleans. Mid-size Casino, with movie theater and a large bowling alley. Shuttle \u2013 they have a free shuttle that takes you to the strip or their sister property the Gold Coast Casino. I took this many times to the strip the Gold Coast. At the Gold Coast you can walk (a mean a short walk) to both the Palm and Rio. Check-in \u2013 check in was smooth. We checked-in at 12 noon and our room was ready. I asked for a strip view which was granted. Upon check-in we received 2 fun books which we used about 4 of the coupons. Example: free souvenir at gift shop (Mardi Gras beads), free fries and soda with purchase of hamburger at Terrible\u2019s inside casino. Great burgers. Also used the free drink a bar coupons. Room \u2013 The room was very nice. 2 queen beds, large dresser, full length mirror, desk, couch, side chair and coffee table. (Regular standard room) Room was very clean. We had a view of the strip. The strip is in the distance, but you could see the strip from Bellagio to Mandalay Bay, beautiful at night. There is actually a window in the bathroom over the tub. Nice to get fresh air in the room. Luckily it was cool in the mornings and we wanted to open the window for fresh air, instead of the hot Vegas weather. Housekeeping was very good and the hotel staff were very friendly. Coffe Maker \u2013 you actually have a coffee maker in your room, which is rare in Vegas. But, they do have a $5.00 resort fee per day which includes all the coffee you can drink. Security \u2013 You must show your room key to access elevators to your room. I liked this. Food \u2013 the best. I ate at the lunch buffet twice, it was only $8.95. My husband must of ate 6 plates of crawfish. Terrible\u2019s hamburger were also very good. Liquor store \u2013 the prices are no higher than your local liquor store and about half of what they charge on the strip. After always staying on the strip, it was nice to stay in a hotel that had reasonably priced food, etc. Slots \u2013 I finally won a few dollars here. I never bet big, but put in 20 cents, and hit the bonus round on some corny slot machine. The bonus round paid me $77.00. The next day I wasted $5.00 trying for another bonus round, but no luck, so I walked away. I enjoyed my stay, but if you are a first timer and can afford it, I would stay on the strip my first visit.

Yes, it took a little time, but we checked in Sunday afternoon, so I can understand the delay. Solved the issue by requesting (and receiving without any questions) a new room. Room was spotless, and spacious. Bathroom was divine. Shower recess included a window so you could still enjoy the view from the marble tiled enclosure whilst you washed away the dust of a day on the strip.

We drive from San Diego, so we always have a car and our friends from Texas always rent a car for their 1 week stay. We stayed 5 nights the week after Easter and arrived at 9am on Sunday and they allowed us to check in to our room early (unlike the Tropicana and the LV Hilton). The price was $60 per night and a $5 resort fee per day - why not just call it $65 per night and remove the so called \"fee\". The Rooms: We requested a room near the elevator and were accomodated nicely. The rooms are large and have a nice sitting area which allowed us to visit our friends. The bathroom has a large dressing area by the sink and the toilet and tub (full size) are in another semi closed room (no absolute privacy between the two areas). There is no refrigerator, but we always bring an ice chest and fill up with the ice machine located by the elevators. Some rooms have safes and others do not. I quit smoking 9 months ago, so this is the first non-smoking room I have been in for this hotel, and I believe they are decorated better than the smoking rooms. Elevators: You better move pretty darn fast to catch them on the ground floor as the doors close pretty quickly. We never had to wait very long for an elevator from the room floor, but try to avoid during peak checkout times. You might have to let 3 elevators go before you get one that can take on more people, especially if you are on the lower level floors. So the key to reserving a room - Close to elevator, nonsmoking, and upper level floor. The Pool Area: Adequate and the jacuzzi is a large circle surrounding a rock formation. Some jets are powerful and others so so. The jacuzzi could be warmer, but they allow kids under 12 to be in the spa with adults, so they probably keep it cooler to avoid liability. Unfortunately, the closed the pool on the day that we chose to go for repaving, but they did keep the spa open. Casino: HUGE! and lots of penny slots. I do not play the tables, so I can't tell you much here. Pretty slutty costumes on the cocktail waitresses. Even my husband found this to be more offensive then I did. I thought about applying for a job as a cocktail waitress just for giggles. Oh, but I did win $80 playing Keno - Yeah! Restaurants and bars: Friday's is good, Canal street was good for the prime rib (overpriced), Cafe was extremely slow and turned out to be $30 for breakfast for two (outrageous), the buffet was disgusting for $6 for breakfast (avoid at all costs) and they do not serve tomato juice. Bloody Mary ordered while playing slots was pretty good! Rock/Pop band that was playing in the casino bar was entertaining, but not great. A couple of years back, we heard a great band in the Irish Pub. Elvis impersonator was more funny than talented. Showroom: We saw the Temptations (only Otis is original) and they were fantastic for a couple of old guys - way more energy than my 20 year old kids. I ordered the tix online before leaving home and the original cost was $60 for seats in the 5th row. They did allow me to use my 2 for 1 discount from my funbook (you get one with checkin) so that was really nice. The accoustics in the shworoom could use some improvement, but the seats were comfy and lots of leg room, plus they do provide drink holders - you just have to bring your drink in before the show starts.", "Date": "April 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson", "Title": "\u201cNot horrible but could make some changes\u201d", "Author": "RacyGirl", "ReviewID": "UR7302624", "Content": "We stayed 4 nights at the hotel, late March through early April, 2007.

I purposely chose an off-strip hotel as we were staying with 3 kids. We had a car so it was not an issue for us. Check in: Very quick - maybe 10 minutes. Asked for strip view and got a room on the 18th floor. Asked for a crib and got it right when we got up to our room, very quick. Room: The rooms here are nice. We were in room 1808 which was a really long walk from the elevator, but didn't bother me. The room had 2 double beds that were really comfy and a sitting area with a couch, chair & coffee table. I was really surprised by the size of the room. Very nice. The bathroom was ok, just average with regular tub & shower. Didn't really dig the sliding door, but oh well. There was also a desk area with the internet connection that we didn't use. Entertainment: What we used was the arcade, which was adequate, but not fantastic. It had a really small one by the bowling alley and a little larger one by the movie theater. The bowling alley is really nice and big. We had 4 people bowling 2 games with shoes costed $17.50 (this was with a coupon from the book they give you at check in). Bowling is $1 between 12am & 8am though so if you are up...We did not see any movies, but the theater was really nice and huge. Pool: It was March so pool hours were only until 6pm. The big pool is nice and big. It is only about 3-4 feet everywhere. It was not heated, so it was a bit cooler. There were stairs all around the pool and kind of a ledge that kids could walk on in the pool around the edges as well. The kids pool was great. It was a small circle and was heated - this meant lots of adults hanging out in there as well. It was a wading pool around the edge and then the middle had some stairs and went a bit deeper. This pool is in the sun all day until about 4pm so put sunscreen on your young ones! The other pool had shade for more than half the day. The jacuzzi was really nice. It was a circle with a large tree and rock/fountains in the middle so you didn't see the people on the other side of you. Spa/Fitness: I only used the jacuzzi & steam room. I didn't have any services done. This is separated for men and women. Not many people in there when I was there. The steam room was really hot as was the jacuzzi. This was a free area. There were separate shower stalls and a nice dressing area with all the things you need. They have water bottles in there as well. The gym was really nice as well and didn't cost to use as I know some do. Business Center: It had an area for faxing, copying etc plus 4 computers with internet access if you weren't using a laptop. No charge for this. Restaurants: We only ate at the French Market Buffet. We were gone most of the time. Hubby and son ate breakfast once and really liked it and we also did lunch & dinner on 2 separate days. Lunch was similiar to dinner in my opinion, dinner just costed $5 more. $13.95 for dinner & $8.95 for lunch. I thought it was very good. Casino: I only play slots so not an expert. Lots of 1 & 5 cent slots though. More than I have seen at other places. I thought it was fine, not too smoky and the waitresses seem to come around fairly often.

Flew Champion out of MPLS in a snowstorm and actually arrived early, got a rental at Alamo, and we were on our way.Arrived early at Orleans around 10 am on Friday, and wondered if we could check in early at the hotel. They said no problem, and I asked for Strip View, High, and they gave us the 17th Floor with a very nice view of the Strip. Room was clean, spacious, and was smoking, although I don't think you could tell. Overall, we really liked the Orleans. We had a car so there was no problem going where we wanted. Alamo gave us an upgrade at pickup, ( and this happens alot), all the smaller cars were out and they have done this before, just ask the guy in the lot to initial your papers for an upgrade and you are on your way. $100 for 4+ days, including taxes and fees. Back to the Hotel: CHECK-IN: No line, took maybe 5 minutes, checkout...no line took 2 minutes at most. ROOMS: Made up daily whenever we wanted an no issues. All have a couch, 2 chairs, and coffee table, in additon to the Bed, also, writing table. Bathroom pocket door a little cumbersome, but ok. CASINO: Lively, relatively smoke free, and smelled non casino like, if you know what I mean. Plenty of offers for drinks, although Fri and Sat nite are busier, we found it to be easy to get a drink. We play slots and they have plenty, along with a lot of penny slots, and some of the newer games. Overall they had more than most casinos as far as variety. We have a couple large casinos up here, that always have the newest games, so we know what to look for and what we like. We won and lost as much here as anywhere, and did not feel games were overly \"Tight\" FOOD: Buffet was okay, just had breakfast there once, not great but fine. Ate at TGIF in casino one night, and that was okay, waiter screwed up, but the food was good and convenient. Went to Ellis Island and had a 4.95 Steak Dinner one night and it was really good, mine was like a Filet Mignon. Tried a Metro Pizza just down past MGM a bit on Flamingo, and it was huge and fabulous. INTERNET: Only if you pay, I did not, even though I had my laptop. I think it was $10.99 for 24 hours, there is a cable in the room if you do not have wireless card Can't believe it will be much longer before wireless is everywhere, and free, it is almost like having a phone in room these days. That is one of my pet peeves. IN ROOM COFFEE: Only 2 paks of Regular Coffee and 2 DeCafs, each day, coffee maker makes 1 at at time. Suggest you bring some intstant or some packs if you want to make more without going down stairs to get it at Seattles Best in Casino. COUPON BOOK: A couple usable coupons, couple drinks, 5 bucks off at TGIF, and some fries and a drink at Terrible Mikes snack bar. Not great, but saved us a few bucks here and there. SECURITY / QUIETNESS : Always asked to show our card by gaurds as we got to elevators. Very Secure, and never heard a sound anytime at nite. Great for sleeping. PARKING: Parked our car right in front of Hotel everyday, never went to self park garage, had to search for a spot a few times, but never took very long, very convenient to hotel. WEATHER: Pleasant, Sunny days around 65 and cooler nights, around 45, bring a lite jacket or sweatshirt and maybe some shorts if you want for the days. This week is warmer and soon it will be hot. No Rain, just Partly Cloudy one day. PROXIMITY TO STRIP: A non-issue for us, maybe 5 minutes to the strip for us, and with the car, liked to come and go whenever. If you want to avoid the strip traffic, you can always head north on 15 and get off at whichever street is closest to where you want to go. PROXIMITY TO AIRPORT: Took us maybe 15 minutes from Alamo, which is just a couple minutes from Airport. When we left from Mandalay Bay, we dropped off car, and were on Alamo Shuttle within 15 minutes, this during rush hour. Very Easy to get there. OTHER: First time here and we would stay again, almost everyone was friendly and the hotel smelled fresher than most. Not ovely glamorous but very nice and comfortable. Paid $336 for 4 days with air from MPLS, so it was a really good deal I think. Flew Worry Free MLT.

If you've been to Vegas before and \"have seen that, done that\" on the strip then this is the hotel for you. Very easy getting in and out of the parking garage (ground floor) and accessible to the \"back roads\" to access other properties without having to do the strip route. Very spacious, rooms are big and spotless. I love the assortment of slot machines throughout the large casino.' The table games are good and we enjoy playing Pai Gaw poker here; especially when they have the $5 tables in the morning. The pit bosses are very friendly and nice too. The Courtyard Buffet is the biggest bargain of all! Always delicious food, good service and the variety of food at each meal is great!! We did have lunch at Terrible Mikes and I think that is way too expensive for what you get.

Even though it's off the strip the Orleans is huge and has everything in there you might need. There are plenty of dining options from casual fast food style to the fancier Canal Street Market and our personal fave: the Prime Rib Loft You must try the Prime Rib Loft, its set above the hustle and bustle of the casino and the food is quite good. The staff is what really makes your experience though both in the restaurant and everywhere in the hotel. Staff treat you like gold they are so nice! I left a tip for the maid and it took 3 days for her to finally take it! So sweet. Also they treated everyone the same we noticed whether they looked like a high-roller or a penny slots player.

What a nice touch, I recommend a strip view room here because its far enough back you get a great view of the whole strip at night.

Not sure if this is an American thing but the sort of behaviour I saw would NOT fly here in Canada, as such I was offended at times.

In other words, supposedly it is more patronized by locals from Las Vegas. This is usually a good thing, and is definitely a good indicator in the case of the Orleans. It is one of the best values for the money. The rooms are beautiful, in a kind of French style, and they are pretty big, with a sitting area made up of a couch and coffee table. there is also a desk and chair in addition to the bed(s). The dining options and entertainment are very down-to-earth but not what I'd call \"cheap\" or \"low-class\". Very middle-class, actually. Good, reasonable restaurants. The buffet is very good and very inexpensive, quite possibly the best or one of the best buffet values in all of Vegas. They have a very nice bowling alley which is inexpensive and they typically give you a coupon for it in their Funbook. The Funbook coupons help you to save a few bucks in the various hotel establishments from the bars to the gift shop to the bowling alley. They have a coffee shop (Seattle's Best, I believe) and a few decent bars. The service at the gambling tables is great. The gambling itself is very good, with quality, experienced dealers and every gaming option, but low bet minimums compared to most casinos in Vegas. The biggest downside is the location, as the Orleans is located several blocks away from the strip on Tropicana Ave. To get anywhere else requires a taxi - nothing is \"walkable\" unless you don't mind walking for about an hour. However, they do supply a shuttle service for free which will take you to their sister hotels, including the Barbary Coast which is at center strip. Of course, you can also always get a taxi. It seems that most people who stay at the Orleans have a car (their own or rented). I have only stayed there when I have had a rental car. This hotel is very much like its sister hotel the Gold Coast, which is several blocks north on Flamingo Ave. The theme is a New Orleans theme, and this hotel is bigger than the Gold Coast, and has a little more entertainment (such as the bowling alley and a huge arena where events such as sporting events and rodeos take place). The rooms are a little nicer and bigger here also. The Gold Coast does have a better location, though, being right next to the Palms and Rio, and only a couple blocks (a short, cheap taxi ride) from center strip. If you have a car, the Orleans is one of the best deals you will find, they typically have among the lowest rates in all of Las Vegas.

I asked for a strip view and was told no problem. We had the 12th floor, great view, wide window. Rooms: nice and spacious. Very good mattresses and pillows. Also had a couch, coffee table and chair plus a desk. Bathroom was nice and clean. Decent tolietries. I liked the little push out window in the shower- allowed the fresh air in. Sliding door between the bath and bedroom was heavy to move. Not a problem to me but maybe to elderly visitors. They should work on the door tracts. Security: always someone there to flash your room card too. Housekeeping: willing to provide more coffee. Great job cleaning the rooms early in the day. The one cup coffeemaker was a bit primitive but hey, most casinos don't even provide one. Casino: very nice, fun atmosphere. Nice New Orleans feel about it. My buddy and I both seem to have great luck at video poker there. He got 2 royal flushes at 1 grand each. Seem to be many good machines there but I would like to see more 10-7 machines there. I like the $5 blackjack tables with good dealers and 2-1 blackjack payoffs - a vanishing feature. Good poker room. Very popular. We had a 1 hour wait till some room was available. Wish they had more dealers/tables. Eats: always like the Buffet, especially the stir-fry where you pile veggies on your plate, hand it to the chef and he cooks it on the big Mongolian grill with either beef or chicken. The Sushi place looked good but didn't go. I think there are at least 8 eateries there. Parking: I like being able to park out front. I made the mistake of using the valet the first day. I had to wait 15-20 minutes for someone to bring the car. Overall: for the money my favorite place in Vegas. I love the Golden Nugget as a hotel but the gambling just isn't as good as here.

One thing I will say from the beginning since barely anyone mentions it (and probably didn't actually experience it), the Rick Thomas magic show was great! You get a Buy One, Get One free showroom ticket in the Fun Books that you get when you check in, and so the magic show was only $24.95 for two people. I felt bad because at the time that we went, the audience was so minimal but the show was SO GOOD (theater was only about a quarter full, don't know what was going on with Vegas then, but even the strip was empty in the afternoons). Anyway, the show is in the afternoons, when we went I think it was only on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays at 2pm and 4pm because I think he did shows at the Gold Coast too. It was a great show for families, adults and kids, and when he gets audiences to participate it's pretty hilarious especially with the adults. The vanishing motorcycle illusion was astounding to me! And everyone loved the tigers. After the show, he and his team offer things for sale like DVDs-$10, a book, plush tigers-$10 for small, $20 for the big one (he's an animal activist), and he will sign autographs and take pictures outside after the show. We bought a tiger but I wish I also bought a DVD. Anyway, if you stay at the Orleans, definitely go see the show. =) The hotel was very nice, our rooms were great, and bigger than a normal hotel room and it did have nice touches like the southern/French Orleans decor. The air/heater was loud at night though! And fewer channels here (lots of horse racing channels though if that's your thing) but bring a DVD player if you have kids, the TV has AV hookups. You could also bring your own video game system and hook it up to the TV. Anyway, the buffet was good, all of the servers were very nice. Everyone had a nametag that stated their name and what country or state they were from, which was nice. My husband liked the poker room, it was non-smoking. The only thing we didn't like was that you had to go through the casino to get to everything - all of the restaurants, buffets, showroom, and even the things on the second floor (bowling alley, video game arcade, children's day care center, movie theatre, etc.) could only be accessed by going to the escalators right in the middle of the smoky casino. Overall, it was a great stay, and this hotel is close to the strip but still driving is recommended. It is family-friendly (except for the smoke), lots of kids around, but I think many of them were local families (there was a Disney on Ice show at the Orleans Arena during our stay).

Canal Street and Pime Rib Loft are a must for a nice dinner. Exceptional casino food, on your break from the action, mornings and afternoons. Disappointed Brendan's Pub doesn't serve food anymore, was looking forward to fish and chips. Casino slots were fun and the attendants accommodated us over and above. Try the new pennie machines, lots of fun and laughs. I know people say, \" I dont play pennies\" but at $3 for max coins, it isn't a pennie machine at all. We had the most fun on these one day. Cocktail waitresses, muy bonita in their skimpy outfits, and many throughout . $5 blackjack was fun untill we ran into a hot dealer, but the dealers were very nice. Poker room and sports book on site are nice. I play poker, on-line, and never played in a casino. So i entered a daily tourney of 68 people for $40. finished 6th and in the money, heyhey. Took 5 hrs. ,learned a whole lot and won $265. The Poker room is non-smoking. I really didn't want to write this review.

We had a room with 2 queen-sized beds. First the good things: the room was large, large enough for a sitting area by the windows with a loveseat, chair, coffee table, and end table, without feeling crowded. It was nice to be able to sit somewhere other than on the beds! The window in the bathroom opened so we could get some fresh air. The decor was modern, not a frill in sight. Our room and the hotel were very clean. The floor we were on was quiet, and even though there were people in the rooms on both sides of us, we didn't hear a thing. The beds were comfortable, some of the best we've had in LV. The staff was friendly and accommodating, and security was good. The not-so-good things: the restaurants were reasonably priced, but the food was not as good as at other LV hotels. We were particularly disappointed in the buffet. A couple of cab drivers had told us that the Orleans buffet was one of the best in LV. It's quite inexpensive, so for the money, I suppose it is. We also ate at the Courtyard Cafe and the Prime Rib Loft and the food was just okay in both places (other than the dinner salad in the Prime Rib Loft, which was large and delicious). The bathroom in our hotel room had a pocket door rather than a normal door, which would have been okay, except the closet and the vanity sink were inside the bathroom. If the pocket door had been installed to enclose the shower and toilet, with the vanity and closet outside, it would have been fine. The main drawback was the hotel location: it's about a mile and a half off the Strip. There is a shuttle but it seats only 18 people. We ended up taking cabs back and forth; with what we spent in cabs, we probably could have stayed on the Strip. If you're renting a car, the Orleans is a very good place to stay.

This was my 6th visit to Vegas and first off the strip. Food: Wide variety and all very well priced. French Market Buffet has a good variety and very reasonably priced (less than $10 for lunch and dinner). I\u2019ve not found a buffet on the strip for this price at this quality. Prime Rib Loft was excellent low prices and great food. Recently added a TGI Fridays to this hotel which was nice as well. Pool: The Pool looked nice although I did not spend a lot of time there. The problem being that at this time of the year (Oct) the pool does not get a lot of sun as the tower of the hotel blocks the sun. Only a small portion of the pool had sun late in the afternoon. Gambling: Always able to find a low limit game. They even had $3 Black jack and always $5 games. The poker room was always busy however lots of good players and lots of locals. Not a good poker room for a friendly tourist game. Cocktail service was good both at the tables and the slots. Never had problems getting a drink. Dealers at the low limit games were friendly but mostly had heavy accents as they were all imported Americans. Rooms: Rooms were very clean and very spacious. They had a small couch and chair and were very open. Beds were comfy and maid service was prompt. I did not like the heavy sliding door on the bathroom. It was hard to open and close. I was surprised that the shampoo and soap bottles were generic and not been labeled with the Orleans logo. I did like that a security guard was at the base of elevator to check for room keys before getting in the elevator. Entertainment: The lounge acts at the Orleans were disappointing. The main lounge had an Asian cover band which was not very good. Brennan\u2019s Pub was ok with live music late at night. Drinks were reasonable though at the lounges in comparison to the strip properties. Shopping: The Orleans had a liquor store with unreal prices. A \u201960 of rye, rum, or vodka for less than $15 and 18 packs of Budweiser for $9.99. For Canadians do your duty free shopping here! Overall the Orleans was great and I would definitely stay at this hotel again if it were on the strip. They do have a shuttle service which was very nice to get back and forth the Barbary Coast.

My family and I stayed here during Christmas of 2005. I originally reserved 3 rooms (for 8 people) thru the website for 50 dollars a night. After 2 weeks I found a cheaper rate on a travel website and called them back to see if they would match the rate. THEY DID! I got all three rooms for a week (Mon-thursday) for 18 dollars a night (per room)! The friday rate was 74 dollars. Just our bill (my husband and mine's) was 150 dollars for the entire week (with room service!) The hotel was gorgeous, an antebellum style New Orleans hotel with lots of amenities and things to do. A person could literally stay for 2 weeks and never have to leave the hotel. We had a great time, we stayed on Christmas Eve playing Black Jack till 3am! The only drawback is the amount of smoke in the casinos. My sister got pneumonia shortly after that and bronchitis. Yucky. That's anywhere in Vegas I guess though. For people with kids, we saw the Kids Daycare play area, it looked like fun. I think you can drop your kids off for a couple of hours for 6 bucks an hour or something while you go gamble. We had our daughter with us, but since we had so much family we opted out of leaving her in there by herself. We went and saw a movie, that was great too, the theater was lovely and big. The rooms in the hotel were huge! There was a cute little window in the bathroom where you can see the view of the strip. I am including some pictures of my sisters king bed room with bathroom.

Compared to the bigger/nicer casinos...this place is okay. First, the good: 1. Rooms are big with a nice little sitting area and spacious bathroom. Although I'm not too fond of the closet space being in the bathroom. 2. The food choices are good and reasonably priced. Compared to prime rib, mexican, italian and buffet choices on the strip...this place matches quality while maintaining a good price. Buffet was especially good for the money. My dish at the Mexican place was okay, but I'm a Mexican junky that has pretty high standards in this cuisine. 3. Very attractive coctail waitresses with very nice outfits. 4. Great drink service both at the bar and on the floor. This place wants to keep you drinking on the cheap. A buzzed player makes more mistakes than then sober player. I can attest. 5. The liquor store was cheaper than most I've seen anywhere. This was great for me since I was here 5 nights and not a big gambler. The not-so-good: 1. The slots/VP were tight. I didn't gamble hours on end, so it could of just been bad timing. But most times I have lost money at the casino, I am able to do so at a comfortable place. I would go on horrible runs here, and it happened too frequently. I was always under the impression that off-the-strip equaled better odds. Didn't seem that way here. 2. The casino had a bit of a stale smoke smell. The newer casinos do a much better job at filtering out the smoke and pumping in a nice fragrance. 3. The new LV law doesn't allow smoking in eating establishments. The Irish bar chose the smoking over the eating, thus eliminating a menu. 4. No other casino to just walk over to. But this was known ahead of time, and was likely reflected in their low rates. 5. Lack of nightlife. The Irish Pub was practically empty. There was a band playing music in the casino but that was about it. The choices were to gamble or eat. ---Overall, a great place for a bargain. Especially on a long stay.

Arrived on Sunday night around 8 pm. No lineup at check-in. Asked if there were any upgrades available and the girl said she could give us a room with a strip view at no charge. Great! The room ( #1622) was quite large and had a great view of the strip. The windows were not very clean however and there was a 1 foot wide stain on the carpet. It had been clened but still. The room was very clean, I don't think they have cable TV because the choice of channels was limited. However, since we didn't spend much time in the room, it wasn't a major problem. Bathroom was fine, just a regular tub but good water pressure and I hated that wood sliding door they have separating the bathroom from the room. It was very annoying. Other than that, really can't complain. The hotel is very big and it took us a while to get acquainted with the layout. There are several restaurants in the hotel itself, an italian place called Sazio? where we had a very enjoyable meal the evening we got there. We also had a breakfast buffet ($6.95)that had a lot of choices for meatlovers however they mostly had canned fruit and the only fresh fruit available were overripe bananas. If you want regular or whole wheat toast, you still have to line up at the counter where people are ordering omelets etc.. and it can take a long time. I don't know why they just don't put in a toaster and people can help themselves. There are also several other restaurants including a Subway and Seattle Coffee and an ice cream place. When you check-in, you receive a coupon booklet with several discounts at the various restaurants in the Orleans and coupons to other restaurants & bars in the other Coast Hotels. About the service: Service at this hotel was great throughout. From the cleaning staff to the waiters at the buffet, everyone was very pleasant and helpful. About the shuttle: It is great that there is a free shuttle to Barbary Coast. That brings you smack in the middle of the strip. We never waited more that 10 to 15 minutes for the shuttle. It runs from 9:30 am to 12:30 PM. The only major problem with that is, like other people have said before, there is no designated line or bus stop, so that when the shuttle comes, he stops anywhere and people just start going in. Most tourists are respectful and will let you on before if you had been waiting before them, however, there are sometimes when people will just cut in and if you don't speak up, you may be left waiting for the next shuttle as there are only about 18 seats on the shuttle. There's a sign that says that you must show the room key in order to get on but we were only asked to produce the key once in the more than dozen times we took the shuttle. All in all, a very good experience and great value for the money, even though it is off the strip. We would usually leave the hotel around 9 am and spend the day on the strip before returning around 5 Pm to rest a little. Then we would go back to the strip to catch a show and if we didn't make it on time for the last shuttle, we would grab a cab. P.S.: You cannot hail a cab just by raising your arm in the air.

First, we are like many Orleans regulars who travel here from out of town. Our first few times in Las Vegas, we stayed on the strip. Then we discovered th Orleans and we now use it as our primary resort when we travel to Las Vegas. We have stayed here 7 times now. This trip, we stayed several nights at the Orleans and a few on the strip. Here is my thoughts. First, the really bad... The SLOTS are TIGHTER than trying to get a raise from Ebeneezer Scrooge prior to Christmas eve! This observation was made after days of play and is not based on my viewpoint but practically EVRYONES viewpoint. It seems that the Slots have been severely tightened up. We also played at the strip at several properties there and the amazing thing is the much better payouts we experienced on the strip than compared to the Orleans. AGAIN, this observation is based on many hours over several days of play from not only myself but practically everyone we discussed this with who played around us. The Orleans Slots ARE TIGHT! We and others who have chosen to stay here in the past always felt that we were much smarter to stay and play at the Orleans rather than staying on the strip. But after this last experience we will reconsider staying here in the future. A message to the new owners...if you have tightened the slots up it will take other people a little longer to notice but they will. So your \"Cost Cutters\" always look smart in the short term but if they ruin the superior value expereince that made people choose the orleans in the first place....well long term people like us wll not choose to stay and CERTAINLY NOT play the slots here EVER again. I cannot believe I am saying this but if I stay here again, NEXT TIME I will play the slots OVER ON THE STRIP!! Another cheapy cost cutting move appears in the free drinks. VERY WEAK. Did I say VERY? Also, A waitress had to seek premission to get me a \"Double\"..... Good Grief. Again, when we compared the drink quality to the quality of drinks we got on the strip, THERE WAS NO COMPARISON. The Orleans drinks were terribly weak in quality. This never used to exist on the previous trips here. Also noted in the spa were other cost cutting moves including the hot tub where the temperature has been turned down a few degrees (it used to be blazing hot)...The timer on the hot tub only goes for 15 minutes (Used to go 45) so therefore the cost cutters made me get out of the tub several more times each trip than before. Furthermore the steam room......You used to open the door and steam would come roaring out....NOW I could barely see any steam and I did note some guy coming out and searching the walls trying to find something to turn up the steam. Other observations: Front Desk - Very good. Accomodating and reasonable with our request. Security - -excellent....Maybe the best in vegas as those guys in front of the elevators are fully engaged and making everyone show their keys to proceed further...24 hours a day. Good job. Dealers & Pit Bosses -- Very good again. Genuinely very friendly and had a couple engagements with Pit bosses who were very professional in their dealings. Excellent all around. Cocktail waitreesses - -Excellent!! There are a couple exceptions here and there but the majority of these girls hustle like crazy and work their tails off to keep me very well liquored! Maybe the greatest strength of the Orleans? Rooms - Very good. Clean. Housekeeping was excellent. Buffet and cafe were also both very good. Those people in the Buffet really hustled on the busy nights. The buffet is lucky to have employees like these who worked really hard to take care of the overwhelming crowds. Overall....The employees get an 8 out of 10 for service and most of them try really hard to take care of your needs. Finallly....Can you guys get the shuttle line situation resolved? It is always a free for all if there are more people than seats. It is ridicoulous that people who were waiting 25 minutes cannot get on because the shuttle driver stops in various places and poeple who showed up right before he arrives get on the shuttle before the people who were there for 25 minutes. This happens all the time and adds strees to what should be a strees free time.

I immediately assumed that it was too good to be true. Much to my surprise and delight I was able to book a room for the dates that I wanted with no problem. I'm a skeptic by nature so I assumed that there would still be something wrong so I began reading the reviews to prepare myself for the worst. Again I was surprised by the number of good reviews. Check in was a breeze and the coupon book mentioned by other guests in the reviews came to be very helpful and saved me money. My room/suite was large and very clean, I requested a top floor with a view of the strip and was granted it without incident. All in all I can say that I was very pleased with the room, especially for the low low price of $25 per night. The only complaint that I do have is that the walls are thin and you can hear everything going on in the hallway, ie kids running in the hall, housekeeping knocking on other doors at 8 am and holding conversations with one another while cleaning (I recommend utilizing the do no disturb signs unless you want to be woke up at the crack of dawn). A few reviews mentioned that the casino was full of smoke but it was no worse than any of the other casinos on the strip. I took a shuttle to the hotel from the airport for a mere $10 for a round trip ticket. The complimentary hotel shuttle to and from the strip ran like clockwork and I was always able to get a seat but I can imagine it's worse during peak seasons. A cab ride to or from the strip will run about $10 with tip and a rental car was unnecessary unless you want to venture away from the strip, I suggest you save your money for gambling or shows. The food at the hotel was less than stellar, even the food at Fridays was sup par and the Italian restaurant was only so so, Terrible Mike's makes a great burger and is made to order so you know it's fresh. They also have a Subway on site for a quick bite. I would suggest eating at one of the nicer hotels on the strip if you want a really great meal.

We had 3 rooms, 2 of which I booked through vegas.com for 4 nights back in August for $25/night and the 3rd I booked directly through the hotel in November for 3 nights at $110/night. At that time, I was told the 16th was sold out, but when I checked in, I would be able to extend my stay. I arrived at 11 p.m. No line at check-in, but it took about 20 minutes to check in because I needed to book the additional night. A supervisor had to complete the transaction because the person who waited on me had problems with the computer system. However, they were very courteous and apologized for the delay. The supervisor was able to give me a lower rate on that room than what I had booked for through the hotel, and the room rate averaged $50 a night for 4 nights. My room was on the 3rd floor with a view of the Strip. The room was clean. The mattress was very firm to me since I'm used to a plush pillow-top mattress at home. Three of my friends told me their mattresses were very plush, but one told me their mattress had a dent in it. The pillows were very flimsy. The bedspread and blanket on my bed each had a burn hole in it. Otherwise, the room was clean. My room was 275 steps from the elevator near the end of a long hallway, so I didn't hear any noise from any of the other guests during my stay. The carpet in the hallway had a few stains from what looked like what had been room service trays being placed on the floor outside the room doors. We ate at Fridays the first night, and it was your typical Fridays. Very pleasant waiter. We ate at the breakfast buffet on Thursday morning. Mostly canned or frozen fruit on the buffet, but for the price, it was expected. I couldn't get the waitress to refill my coffee cup. She was too busy chatting with another one of the waitresses to wait on the tables after she brought the coffee initially. One of my friends realized that the desserts were available during breakfast, so she had dessert instead of breakfast. Thursday night we ate dinner at the Prime Rib Loft around 10:30 p.m. The service was excellent, and the food was surprisingly good. The prime rib was $13.95 and came with a baked potato and salad. We ate off the property for all our other meals. I played the dollar slots for 10 minutes in the Orleans and came out ahead $107, so I cashed out. The casino was no smokier than any other casino I visited during this trip. Compared to the Vegas of long ago, it seemed nearly smoke-free. I've been going to Vegas since my college days in the 70s, and I've always stayed on the Strip previously. I rented a minivan on this trip, and we valet parked everywhere we went, which was very convenient. The traffic on the Strip was very minimal compared to previous trips, but I knew to drive on the streets that ran parallel to the Strip at night to avoid the traffic when driving to shows. We also drove out to Red Rock Canyon, which was one of the highlights of the trip. In the past 30 years, I've stayed at most every hotel on the Strip when they were fairly new. Unfortunately, most of the hotels don't maintain their rooms as they age in the same manner that they maintain their public areas, which is a shame. These days I'd sooner stay at the Orleans and tolerate their stained carpet and burn holes and spend my money on shows, good food, and gambling rather than staying at a hotel on the Strip that seems more like a shopping mall than a hotel.", "Date": "December 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Solihull UK", "Title": "\u201cMy home in Vegas!\u201d", "Author": "Petertm", "ReviewID": "UR6473301", "Content": "I've been to vegas 6 times in total and the last 2 times have been at the orleans, overall for what you get the orleans is fantastic value for money, I first started going out to the orleans from the strip for the better video poker and the $5 double deck blackjack in the casino, that pays 3 to 2, try finding that anywhere at Wynn! As a result I started getting cut price room offers from the hotel things like $25 a night and your 4th night free including weekends , I never got any comps or room discounts from any strip hotel. I was reluctant about staying off the strip but thanks to the room prices I can rent a car and still pay less than staying at somewhere like luxor the location doesn't turn out to be that much of a problem and there is always the shuttle to the Barbary Coast in the heart of the strip if you don't want to drive, I do agree that walking is not an option. OK the hotel it's not the Bellagio and it doesn't try to be but the rooms are big and comfortable with a proper sitting area though the hotel calling them mini suites is stretching it, some peple say they've had trouble getting a non smoking room or a king bed room but I've always got the that combination when asked for and I've not noticed any sign of smoking in my non smoking room. The hotel as it caters to locals as well as tourists has a good selection of value restaurants that may not have a celebrity name head chef but are dam side cheaper, especially good are the Mexican, Chinese and the coffee shop which has excellent value specials, some have said the buffett is good but I disagree for a no frlills meal the coffe shop is much better I had a comp once for it and I'd say free is about the right price! Now when offered meal comps I always ask for the coffee shop! On check in they give you a fun book with coupons you can actually use and the pool is good though not quite like the uber pool complexes that some of the strip hotels and shading is a bit of a problem. Finially some people complained of poor or rude service I not noticed this at all in fact I've found the service the best I've experienced in vegas I've stayed at the Tropicana(old) Luxor(really small rooms!) and New York New York(really dark and dingy small rooms!) unlike the strip dealers remembered me from previous visits and the maids always were helpful perhaps people who complained never heard of this thing called tipping remember everyone in vegas needs tips to turn their poverty pay into something that will pay the mortgage so it's case of if you look after them they will look after you, it's just the way it is!

There is also a liquor store that has very competitive prices. The room was big and comfortable with a sofa and coffee table which was nice. The bed was comfortable and when we asked for extra pillows these were brought up straight away. All the staff we dealt with were friendly and polite, and I must especially commend the security guys who patrol the parking garage who came to our rescue when our car battery went flat. We explained we were tourists from England and were having problems with our rental car. Straight away the security guy radioed in his colleague who came with his pick up and jump-started our car in a matter of minutes. They seemed like real heros to us!! The drinks were much cheaper at the bar at the Orleans than at other hotels on the strip. Two mixed drinks at the Orleans = average $9.50; 2 mixed drinks at Mandalay Bay = average $18.00!!!!

We had stayed once before for only one night as the previous trip we were unable to get into Mirage on a Saturday Night. The first trip we were pleasantly surprised with our Stripview room. Unless there is a huge variety in room size, those that post that the rooms are small are insane, they are quite large. Anyway, this trip we booked a suite, which was less than a standard room at Mirage during the same time frame. We checked in to Suite 2030 and were overall very satisfied. It had a huge living area with a large sectional, dining room table, and a large wet bar, granite counter, and four bar chairs. The view behind the bar was of the entire Strip that is similar to the view from Ghost Bar at Palms. The seperate bedroom was also huge. The bathroom was nice, though basic in our opinion for a suite. Access to the suites on the 20th floor was by room key only, which was very quiet, no kids wandering the hallways. Huge and only complaint...when we booked we called Olreans to verify that the pool would be open during our stay and were told that it was. Well, when we got there it wasn't, except on weekends. I have sent a letter to management regarding our stay and the disappointment that this caused. I have not heard back from them, tho they have my home and email address. The weather that week was perfect for sunbathing, 80+ degrees and cloudless skies. Further complaint was when I spoke to the front desk supervisor, she simply stated she got an email a couple of days ago that the pool would be closed during the week. What we later found from another couple that we were able to use the pools at the Suncoast or Gold Coast. Too bad we didn't find this out until several days into our stay. This is information that the front desk supervisor should have shared but didn't. Obviously we were not impressed with her after that. As far as the casino, we really liked it. Yes, people are smoking there, and we are non-smokers, but we find it no worse than the smoke at Mirage, TI etc. I just read another review that said it was unbearable. I guess a Vegas casino is not for that person!! Anyway, nice low table minimums, $5 BJ and $1 roulette. A nice change from Strip Casinos where you often are hard pressed to find $25 blackjack. Drink service was fast and friendly, we were playing video poker alot and always tipped $3 for two drinks. This is apparently a good tip there as we were offered refills faster than we could drink them. Nice bonus, I hit a royal flush. Restaurants: The Courtyard Cafe was excellent, food was good and very reasonable. Good service. Don Miguels- Very good Mexican food. The coupon book at check in gives you a free Margaritta with an entree. Canal Street- Excellent food, we had a veal dish and King Crab legs. Too bad the waitress was terrible. For their gourmet restaurant, they should not use a waitress that would have been Marginal for Denny's. Room Service- Only had breakfast, very good food and great room service personnel. TGIFridays- Good food, just like all the other ones. We had the buffet once for breakfast, good selection, good service. Sazio- Pretty good Italian food and found great service.

They said we could get 2 roll away beds (we were traveling with our 8, 5 and 9 month old), but it would cost an extra $15 a night per bed. I wasn't happy about this but what could we do.

First visit was to the Sands (now the site of the Venetian) and the Castaways Motel (now the Mirage) during the Rat Pack's reign, on the cusp of Howard Hughes early remake of Vegas. Each visit saw amazing changes. We have stayed at the old MGM (now Bally's), Imperial Palace, the old Aladdin, the Jockey Club, the Maxim (now gone), Harrahs, The Riviera, Bally's, The Hilton, Mirage, Rio, Venetian, in Mesquite (about 75 miles North of LV), and now The Orleans. In other words, from de luxe (Venetian) to de worst (The Riviera.) The Orleans fits in neatly in the middle, good value, good accomodations, fair food at a fair price. Lots of (empty) poker tables, only two 3 card poker tables, no Spanish 21, which is our favorite table game. The pocket bathroom door is impossible to close without loud squeaks at 3 AM. At my age (70) late night visits are the norm . The coffee shop is well located and pretty good. Here's a tip, get your breakfast coffee at the lobby Starbucks and carry it to the coffee shop. The upstairs Prime Rib Room is so-so but the price is right. Chinese food pretty good. Other reviewers have covered all the other restaurants and other amenities. As others have noted the parking is far from the room elevators. Security is on hand in the main elevator lobby but is ineffectual. A scuzzy looking character in front of us didn't show his keycard one evening. So neither did I. Neither of us was challenged. He didn't choose a floor so I did and we and he got off the elevator at my NON-SMOKING floor. He immediately lit up and parked himself on the floor lobby's couch to continue his loud cell phone conversation. About 10 minutes later I went out for ice and he was still talking and smoking. I went out again for soda a little later with same results. This time I said \"This is a non smoking floor\", as any one with a room there would know. He said \"I know\" and kept flagrantly puffing away. Not one to be ignored, I said \"So why are you still smoking?\" in my sweetest manner. Perhaps he detected some sarcasm when he retorted in a series of oaths. I kept walking but reported him (and the lackadasical lobby guard) to Security from my room. I checked later and he was gone. The moral, security is to make us feel good and just maybe deter the bad guys. Keep your eyes open. All in all the Orleans is a good alternative to downtown or the older cheap strip hotels. But don't think it offers luxury on the cheap. Comps are very hard to come by here if you only play the table games. We visited The Wynn which is just out of sight.

Was pretty scared as it was off the strip and only a 3star. Usually we only do 5star and always move hotels if the standard isn't as we would expect. Have stayed at the luxor, bellagio and venetian before and this time had booked the Wynn which is probably the poshest hotel now on the strip but I thought it is crazy spending all this much money for a room which we will hardly be in and the orleans rated 6 on tripadvisor with good reviews so i thought lets go for it and save \u00a3700. I am so glad we did. The Orleans was probably the same standard as the luxor but for a much cheaper price and even though a 5min shuttle ride to the strip it drops you off in the best location, right in the middle of the strip. we never waited longer than 10mins for a bus. Don't walk it would take ages. We got the whole 5 nights for \u00a3330 where all the other hotels eg aladdin and luxor and paris where around \u00a3700. The orleans had sold out on every website i checked for our first night stay but found a company called shilo inns that did it cheaper than expedia and was available for our whole trip so check out this site and it is under \"affliates\". I booked over the phone as I live in the uk. When we arrived I was shocked to see such a big hotel just like those on the strip and how clean it was. The buffet breakfast was $6 (how cheap) and was no different from the aladdin buffet. We spent all day on the strip then at night if we didn't want to go out you have an irish bar, tgi's, bowling etc and it is cheap. The rooms were big and clean the bathroom plenty big enough with shower over bath, tv with movies etc. The pool area is really nice with hot tub but at this time of year was in the shade which was a shame as the temperatures were around 78. there are a few hotels on the strip though with the sun on that you could sneak in eg flamingo and the paris pool was lovely and they even offered us towels. The spa was nothing special but ok. If you have the money and want something really posh do the wynn or bellagio but otherwise spend the difference on yourselves in vegas and stay at the orleans as it has everything you could need and spend all day and night on the strip if you wish as all the hotels want you to spend your time and money in their hotels.

We were looking for a place to stay in LV and were offered a $35 a night deal for two adults and children. The deal included two free games of bowling and two buffet lunches. Be aware that the outside of the hotel can be very busy and it is hard to know where to pull up. The valets are quick to get to you though and they were always quick to retrieve our vehicle when we needed it. Check-in was fast and the young man on the desk was most cheerful and helpful. Getting to the rooms is through the gaming areas but the elevators were overseen by security and they checked our room keys each time. The elevators are divided into two sections, which service separate floors of the hotel so access is very quick. As a previous reviewer noted, the rooms are well appointed and very large. The added lounge area gave us a lot more room for our family of four. The beds were comfortable but very high in keeping with its decor/theme. We had a great view of the Strip even though we did not reqest it. What I really liked was that the hotel staff treated our children with great respect especially when they had to move through the gaming areas. So what didn't I like? Internet access was $10.00 a day and it really is necessary for us when we travel so far from home. The smoke really got to me this time. I expect it to be smoky in the gaming areas but unthinking people seemed to think it was fine to smoke in the elevators. We waited in line to catch the shuttle to the Strip. There was one other couple in front of us. When the bus pulled up, all lthe other people who had arrived later, surged forward and crowded onto the bus. The other couple and ourselves, who were first in line, had to catch a taxi as there was not enough room on the bus. But the really outrageous thing was that there was tea and coffee provided in the room as one would expect, but there was a sign informing us that the first cup was \"on the house\" and each cup after that would be added to our bill at a rate of $1.75 per cup! The other things I mentioned are neither here nor there, but this is really a bit rich. The hotel is well appointed, has great facilities and is excellent value for money if you don't want to stay on the Strip.

We were in town for the National Drag Races and to visit our son, and have been to Vegas many times. Being near the Strip was not important to us this trip. Check-in was an absolute breeze! We checked in on Friday around 5 pm. No lines, and friendly staff. Our room was on the 5th floor, no view at all. Our view was a wall. I had not asked for a room with a view, and didn't really care. This room was very large for a standard room. Very roomy. The king bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on in a hotel. There was an armoire for the TV, a desk and chair, a sofa, coffee table, easy chair and 2 end tables beside the bed plus another by the sofa. The decor was muted gold and dark blue ~ not bad at all. The bathroom had nice tile floor, tile tub/shower. Plenty of counter space in the sink area. The tub had a nice wide ledge to put your shampoo, razor, etc. on. A pocket door between the living area and the bathroom. I don't usually like pocket doors, but this one was nice quality, very heavy duty and slid with ease. The Orleans has a movie theater and bowling center, both of which we used. Very nice amenities for those looking to stay on the property. We did not use or even go look at the pool. I ate lunch at TGI Friday's on the property ~ it was a typical TGI Friday's ~ good food, pretty standard. We ate dinner at Sazio Italian restaurant, which was just average. The coffee shop was good for breakfast. There is a Seattle's Best coffee shop, where we got great latte's in the morning. I am a slot player. The slots at this property were fine, but nothing too special. LOTS of video poker, which is not my game. I like slot machines that have a bonus game (like Wheel of Fortune, Top Dollar, etc.) This casino did have W of F, but not too many other choices of bonus-type slots. I would stay at this property again, because I think it is a very good value. If my main goal was to gamble, I would probably stay somewhere right on the Strip where you can go to different properties easily. Orleans does have a shuttle service to the Strip and back, but I'm not crazy about shuttles. Bottom line ~ this is a nice property.

Plenty of options for food and drinks inside property. There were also some concerts and shows going on (I just missed the Disney's show). If you have car, this is EXCELLENT choice, two minutes away from the strip. It's in the same avenue of NewYorkNewYork (Tropicana Av), but you cannot reach the Strip by foot... Only 7-10 minutes to airport by taxi or car. The rooms are large, air-conditioning is excellent (well, my trip included other US cities and none had a good air-conditioning as in Vegas, but I'm sure every Vegas hotel must have suberb air-conditioning), computer-controlled temperature, good beds, bathroom, bath supplies replaced everyday. Good room service. Iron and iron-boarding, coffee maker and hair dryer available. I didn't have a car, so I used the hotel shuttle to the strip, quite efficient. Clean rooms but with a slight odour of oldness. I thought The Orleans' location was still much better than Circus Circus, Saraha or Stratosphere. I got excellent rates by TripAdvisor affiliates, it was half the price than any Strip Hotel, below $50 (none of the TripAdvisor topTen Vegas hotel had this low price at the time except South Coast, #9 of the list, from the same group owner as The Orleans, but quite far from the strip). Last trip I stayed in Ballys, which has great location and nice rooms, but The Orleans rooms are better. If you are looking really for luxury, then stay in the Venetian, a speechless hotel.

They have Wi-fi but I suppose you need to pay for it. Hotel doesn't offer breakfast, you have to eat somewhere in the casino.

We were disappointed at the amount of table games, they only had a couple of poker tables and no texas hold em which we won and had a blast playing at other hotels.

A good tip is to drive into any of the main hotels on the strip and use the valet parking, for a couple of dollars it is well worth it and a lot less hassle.

They even made us check our key to prove it was our room when we came back and they were cleaning. We were very happy to see that because anyone could have been coming in our room. We liked the security downstairs where you had to show your room key to ride the elevators. Lots of places to eat. Buffet breakfasts at the French Market were great and for about $6.50 each you couldn't beat it. Breakfast at Courtyard cafe was more individually priced items and more expensive. Dinner at Sazio's was great. The lasagna dinner was hugh and delicious. It was about 1/2 of a 13 x 9 pan that I would make at home. Went to see the Blue Man Group and loved it. Just don't buy the drinks. $5 water, $6.50 Beer, $15 mixed drink. But the show was great. Didn't need the earplugs they were giving out. We stayed at the Orleans because of the price and since we are not big gamblers we were planning 2 side trips. One to Hoover Dam (after it reopened because of a crane falling) and an overnight trip to the Grand Canyon. Both were excellent. Since we rented a car we decided to drive and stay overnight at the Canyon. It took about 4 1/2 to 5 hrs. It was a very easy drive once you get out of Vegas. We stayed at the Yavapie Lodge. It reminded you of a dormitory. The rooms were really a lot nicer than we expected. Also very clean. You had to drive to the rim or take a shuttle, which was very conveniently located right outside. The food at the little food court by room registration was not very good, but we were starved. Anyone not visiting the canyon at least once in their life doesn't know what they are missing. It's breathtaking. We loved that it was not all commercialized with bill boards and signs, etc. Just natural and beautiful. It was extremely windy and chilly when we were there 9/20/06. The trails down are great, getting back up is another story. You just have to base your hiking on your physical ability. The wildlife we saw there and on our drive there was amazing. Prong horn sheep, elk, mule deer, squirrels, chipmunks, etc. As for Vegas it was great to see. Using the Orleans as our base camp worked out well. We will definitely go back. You can't beat the Orleans, but you must see Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon.", "Date": "October 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Torrance CA", "Title": "\u201cAn Excellent Value!\u201d", "Author": "brucewlf", "ReviewID": "UR5926709", "Content": "I love Las Vegas and try to visit several times a year; this summer I decided to try somewhere I hadn't stayed before, as well as an off strip location. After doing some research on the vegas themed sites, and of course, turning to the reviews here on Trip Advisor, I decided to try the Orleans. The only \"con\" that most people here listed, is, it is off the strip by a few minutes, but since I always drive to Vegas, I have my car. so I knew that woudln't be an issue. In fact, it's only about 5 minutes from the strip not that bad at all. This hotel was a great value--I stayed from 6/18-6/23-06. Sunday night was $45, and the rest of the week was, I believe about $65. The rooms are LARGE, very comfortable; I was given a \"strip view\" room on the 17th floor, out of a large window I could the see backs of NY NY and so forth, wonderful view, beautiful at night. (I'm fond of staying on upper floors for nice views). Rooms, as i said are large; either 2 queen or a King bed, dresser, desk, and an actual sitting area by the window' the bathroom is to the back of the room, with a door that slides shut (kind of unusual), and one thing I really liked that I had NEVER seen in a hotel bathroom before--there's a window in the shower! Everything was very clean and well kept up. I felt I was getting an excellent bargain, this class of room for these prices. Base rate for my room, for 5 full nights, came to $305; that will only buy you ONE night in many places on the strip now. The food was very good-I ate quite a bit in the \"French Market Buffet,\" they also have a TGIF restaruant inside, a subway, a coffe shop, a \"Terrible Mikes\" which is sort of like a Fatburger, old school greasy diner type stuff, very good too. Another place I enjoyed I don't remember the name of, but it was both a sushi bar and chinese restaraunt! Now, besides all that the Orleans has a 70 lane bowling alley, a multiplex theatre, and an arena that hosts concerts, minor league hockey, WWE wrestling and all kinds of other events. You could actually spend your whole vacation without leaving the property--there is at least a weeks' worth of things to do (not counting the huge casino) and eating establishments to try. That brings me to the only \"con\" from my point of view--this place is big. Not big like the Hilton, or Tropicana, but pretty big. The halls are long (especially when you're tired, lol) and it has one of the largest casinos in town; it takes a few minutes to walk from one end of it to the other; in fact parking is about a half mile away from the room elevators if you go through the casino (seriously). Here's a tip I found out: when you come out of the parking structure, instead of walking into the casino (to your right) go to your left, through the double doors; you will go through a big courtyard, then into the area where the room elevators are. This saves a HUGE amount of walking when returning to the hotel to your room; otherwise you must walk ALL THE WAY through the casino. (Unless you LIKE all that walking-- I don't happen to :) ) I was pleased with everything about this hotel; from the courteous quick check in, the room, the food, the gaming (I won a bunch of money, by the way); service was excellent, it is an unbelievable value and I enjoyed it a lot.

We had orginally booked at Circus Circus but changed due to the reviews on this site. The Orleans was fantastic. Check in was quick and easy and we were given a fun book each. The fun book has coupons for discounts for a variety of different resturants, bars and facilities such as bowling etc. The rooms were very large and comfortable. More importantly they were clean and the bed was extremely comfy. The facilities were great. The pool was large and clean and very cooling after the heat of the day. It does close at 6pm, but I soon found out that most vegas hotel pools do as they want you in the casinos not the pool. The hotel and casino is huge, with the outdoor pool area, movie theatre, bowling alley as well as the casino itself. We saw very few children and once the door was closed to your room it was quite. We ate at the buffet which was delicious and my partner won a dinner for 2 to the prime rib loft at the monday night football party in Brendans pub. The dinner was delicious but as most things in vegas there was way to much food. We used the shuttle bus to get to the strip and it drops you off outside the Barbarry Coast Casino which is across the road from the Bellagio. The shuttle bus back to the Orleans was a little trickier to catch as it is only a 20ish seater bus and there was always lots of people that came from no where to get on the bus. There was no line and people didnt care if you had been waiting longer, they just pushed their way on. After a couple of days we realised you could catch the public bus from the corner outside New York New York which dropped you off directly outside the Orleans. We would buy a Duece ticket for all day ($5) and you could get on and off the duece as you liked and it was also valid for the public transit system. A couple of times we caught cabs back and from the Luxor to the Orleans was less than $9. The cab drivers can be a bit nasty and we got abused for not giving a big enough tip so we stuck to the bus which didnt take much longer. Overall the Orleans is not as flashy or classy as the bellagio and the like BUT i think was just as nice as it was comfortable and i never felt out of place. The security was great (you had to show your room key at the elevator) and the price was excellent for what you got.

It's a very quiet hotel in relation to the Strip but that's a big plus in my book - I love Vegas for the fact it's loud and \"in your face\" but it's lovely to escape from it to sleep,and there is no better place than the Orleans. The shuttle's a great idea but it's no big deal to get a cab to the strip - most evenings,after spending them on the strip,we just walked to New York,New York and got a cab from there;just over seven dollars (we always gave the driver ten!) to get back and no waiting for the shuttle - simple.

My sister and I are in our 20's and the rest of the family is around 50y/o. Our trip to Vegas was fast and furious and the Orleans fit our budget. We rented 2 rooms for the End of Summer price of $89/weekend and $55/weekday. It was the cheapest I could find for a decent hotel/casino. We actually had a great time staying here. The rooms are huge and the beds are comfortable. We mainly stayed in the casino area so I can't so much about the extra stuff they have there. We ate at the buffet for breakfast/brunch a couple of times. Pretty good selection and their brunch is fantastic. We had dinner one night at the Big Al's Oyster Bar. Really great food! We had comps for $80 and that was enough to feed 6 people! We had a rental car so the trip between the Orleans and the strip wasn't bad at all. It was easy to drive in Vegas. The best way to get to the strip from the orleans is to go west to Decatur and make a right then make a right on Spring Mountain Rd. There is plenty of free parking at the TI and Mirage lots. I didn't win at the Orleans, so I was kinda upset about that! We didn't really gamble anywhere else but at the Orleans. Overall, I think the Orleans is a great place if you want to save your money for gambling and other expensive things in Vegas. If you want a comfortable place for the price, this is a great pick.

In the hotel's defense, they do offer a complimentary shuttle to the Gold Coast (off the strip) and the Barbary coast (on the strip). Just FYI....although the Barbary Coast is very tiny and smoke filled, it was a very happening casino and the patrons were of varying ages (from 20's to 50's). Back to the hotel and casino at hand. The Orleans was clean and everything was in its place. I stayed on a non-smoking floor, however there were ashtrays at the elevators and throughout the floor you could smell light smoke. The room was completely smoke free. The water in the shower did not get very hot, so now chance of burning. The water in the pool are was a better temperature and the pool are is probably the hotels best attribute. If you are going to Las Vegas to relax, the Orleans could be a good bang for the buck.

I used travelaxe to find the best rate, then contacted the hotel directly, and they gladly matched the rate. They even took off the commission that the booking company would have received that is built into their price. Result: room was $5 per night cheaper than the lowest competitor's price. The Orleans was the best hotel in 7 trips that I have stayed in. Everyone from check in to check out was friendly and helpful. The room was a standard non-smoking room on the 10th floor. It also looked as though it had just been remodeled. EVERYTHING looked new. Very, very nice. It seemed roomier than when I stayed at the Golden Nugget. It is also the first trip that I've taken and come back with more money than I left with. Some was from blackjack, the rest from nickle video poker. Second day there, I hit a progressive royal flush for $432.10 (not bad for nickles) and must have had at least 30 sets of quads--all on the same machine all week. Food that we had was very good. We only ate at four of the 14 restaurants. My travel companion (younger brother) isn't much for diversity. We mixed up the menu items each meal, but ate at the pretty much the same restaurants. They also offer a free shuttle to the strip, which we took advantage of. The return trip however, found us with about 60 others waiting to ride a much smaller capacity shuttle back from their sister property, The Barbary Coast. We snatched onto another couple and split the cab fare back to The Orleans ($9.80 plus tip). We were back while I'm guessing the others will still waiting for a shuttle they may not all fit onto. Again, best trip ever. Food wise, gambling wise, room wise, hotel in general. You just can't miss with The Orleans. Make sure to get a rental car.

However we were able to get a good price which made it great value for hotels in Vegas. This time to Vegas we were driving and that proved to be very beneficial for staying at this hotel.

Overall, the hotel is quite nice and I would recommend this to anyone who has a car to get around. I would not rely on the shuttle because returning to the hotel from the Strip can be frustrating at best. This hotel is too far from the Strip to walk unless a 1.5 - 2 mile walk to the Strip each way wouldn't bother you. The pool area is very nice but small for Vegas. The main drawback is that it's mostly in the shade until noon because the building blocks the east-facing side. When it is in the sun, there is very little shade because they do not have umbrellas to allow you to decide how much sun or shade you get. So, it's basically all sun or all shade. The music at the pool is lively and is neither a snooze nor head-banging. Just a word of advice. If you leave the pool area, even very briefly, you MUST leave some of your belongings or they will take your towels. I left to use the restroom and not 5 minutes later as I returned to the pool, I watched as the pool attendant removed not only my towels but also the magazines I'd left. I asked why he was taking my things and he said management requires them to do this unless shoes are left behind. Hmmm....so if you prefer to wear your flip flops to the restroom, be sure to leave something else that appears more valuable than a couple magazines or your lounger will be vacated for you. In this case, someone else had already taken my lounger (probably because it was in a really nice location and it was very crowded that day) but the female attendant with very long hair (wish I'd gotten her name) was very apologetic and later came by with a couple complimentary water bottles. As long as you don't plan on spending a day at the pool, I would definitely recommend this hotel.

When we first booked, the Orleans price was higher. As our trip approached, we found lower rates on Travelosity. They matched the lower internet price twice. The hotel is away's off the strip. Walking is not an option. When we arrived, the lobby was LOADED with kids. A soccer championship was going on. People were lying everywhere in the lobby.

I did not think this would be a good experience or a quiet night. To my surprise, when we reached our room, we didn't hear a sound. I was truly shocked at how quiet it was in the room considering the hundreds of kids running around. We were even able to sleep in without being woken up by noise from slamming doors, people's voices, or cleaning staff. The rooms were also huge. The bed is not very comfortable, but everything else was fine. We ended up having a great time with the down to earth people we met. Everyone was very friendly and fun to gamble with. We did very well gambling here. The Big Wheel of Fortune was a blast. I won a few hundred, lost a few hundred. It was addicting. My husband plays Texas Hold'em.

The distance wasn't the problem, there was no where to walk, quite often the case for the pedestrian in some parts of Vegas. The strip shuttle was reliable, but returning late at night became a bit of a free for all, with no real queing system. Therefore people tended to just push in.

As a NW Airlines vacation package, the Orleans was one of the cheapest hotel options, but I had read such glowing reviews on TripAdvisor that we gave it a try... From the moment we arrived, we loved this hotel/casino resort and felt like we had arrived \"home\" every time we came back to the Orleans after exploring the Strip, Fremont, and Area 51. Although we were unable to receive the king room we requested, the queen room we received was spotless and huge. Elevator service was always quick and the security requiring guests to show their room key before gaining access to elevators added a nice touch of safety. Room was quiet and we didn't hear noises from other guests in the halls or in nearby rooms. Housekeeping was very efficient and thorough. We enjoyed several of the resort's restaurants and found the prices to be very reasonable and the food quite good. As previous reviewers noted, the onsite liquor store had better prices than back home! The 'fun books' provided at check-in had great discounts on food, drink, and entertainment at the hotel (and some coupons for other Coast casinos like the Barbary on the strip). The bowling alley upstairs was a lot of fun and added a different type of activity to enjoy while on a Vegas vacation (Buy 1, get 1 coupon in fun book too). The only downside to our stay here involved the free shuttle to the Strip (Barbary Coast sister casino). We encountered some difficulties in leaving the Strip, especially at night, because large groups of people would be waiting approx. 30+ minutes for a shuttle, and when it would arrive it was a chaotic mess because people would storm the shuttle to get one of the limited number of seats available (no standing allowed, like on the Las Vegas transit bus, the Deuce). Consequently, it didn't matter whether you had been waiting the longest. The only way you could get on the bus is by pushing and shoving your way onto the bus, otherwise you waited for the next one with other rude people who would do the same again. We had a rental car anyway, so we abandoned the shuttle route and drove ourselves. Maybe a 'take a number' system like the Orleans bowling alley, might be able to alleviate the situation... We can't wait to go back to Vegas, and will definitely plan to return to the Orleans.

I booked the stay with the hotel after seeing Expedia had a rate of $35. When I called the hotel they matched the rate. Our first 2 nights had been at the Paris because they were free. We went to the Orleans on Tuesday. We were very pleased with our stay at the Orleans. We used their pool which I thought was great. I liked that the pool was close to the elevators and you didn't have to walk through the casino to get there. No problem finding a chair and the pool had a ledge where you could just sit in the water and keep cool. The temp was in the 100's. We also bowled 1 afternoon and that was fun. The room was big and very clean. The bathroom was really nice and big too. They have lots of dining options. We went to the buffet quite a bit(my mom loves buffets) and it was good but not great, but the price was reasonable. We also went to Terrible Mike's and that was good too especially with the coupon out of the fun book that they give you when you check in. Their casino is huge and I didn't find it any smokier than the others. I thought their slots were tight except I did win on VP. Since I made the reservations for the group I was a little nervous about the place but after reading all the reviews I decided to go with it and I'm glad I did. Everyone in our group really enjoyed our stay at the Orleans especially considering the price. The only downside is that it's off strip. We had a car so that wasn't a problem.

I found the Orleans to have a fund and friendly environment. The French Market Buffet was the best. You can't go wrong here. Lunch was $8. The only down-side is that the shuttle only runs until 12:30 a.m. and there is only 1 bus. There should at least be two buses, because there are only about 15 seats on it. You have to be aggressive when traveling in groups, if you all want to get on the bus. As far as cable stations are concerned: Who goes to Vegas to watch TV? The hotel wants to be out and about, not cooped up in the room. During those rare instances that I was in my room, I had no problems finding something to watch. I would definitely stay here again.

Many rooms on \"the strip\" can't offer that. We think the pool area at the Orelans is top rate. It has more of a resort feel than other pool areas in Vegas and was just what we wanted for family fun. The gift shop has some reasonable prices on snack items or things we may need when away from home. There is also a shop that sells beer for less than we pay in our home town. The guys played black jack and found the staff friendly. When we left the hotel to see the sights it was always a relief to return to the Orleans.

The room's air conditioning system was very efficient (allowing for easy adjustment of the thermostat), if not at times even cold, which was a pleasant relief after touring the city all day in near 100F+ heat. The casino floor, adjacent to the hotel rooms (as is the typical layout for most Vegas hotels), was busy throughout the day and evening, though not overcrowded like some other hotels along the Strip.

My only negative observations were (1) the collection of plates by the service personnel throughout the meal was a great distraction since they wheel carts around you while pushing chairs aside, sometimes haphazardly; and (2) the breakfast orange juice and coffee were rather bitter in taste.

We took my step-daughter and her best friend for their 21st birthdays and we all had a great time. We thought since it was their first time there, we would splurge and stay on the strip...I am glad we didn't. The prices of strip hotels were about triple what we paid at the Orleans. Granted, there were several conventions in town, but none were that big or well known. I would think places would have lower prices in summer (it was 105 during the day our whole stay!). So for what we paid at the Orleans, we were able to have our own room and the girls had their own room, which made it nice AND affordable. (We were able to spend the extra on tickets to go see \"Mystere\" by Cirque du Soleil at TI-definately worth the money!!) When we arrived (earlier than normal check-in time) I was told that one room was ready and the other would be shortly. It was no problem to take all our suitcases to one room to change and freshen up. We had requested (when we made reservation) to have rooms close to each other, and were pleased to find we had rooms right next to each other. I thought the check-in staff to be courteous and helpful. We received coupon books for discounts at the coffee stand, ice cream shop, Subway & for free drinks. There were so many coupons that we couldn't use them all! Rooms are large with and separate sitting area. Bathroom is well sized and clean. Never had a problem with water or fresh supply of towels. Vending machines had water & soft drinks. There were irons & ironing boards in the rooms alond with small hair dryers. There was a small coffee maker, although you have to pay after the first packet. There were several restaurants there along with a Subway, TGI Friday's (just opened in April). We also ate at the Courtyard Cafe-large portions, but fairly average breakfast. I wish I would have checked out the breakfast buffet. As far as restaurants we ate at (at other hotels) we really liked Sao Paolo Cafe at the Rio (breakfast & lunch during the week, 24 hrs on Fri & Sat.), the buffet at Mandalay Bay, the Rainforest Cafe at MGM. The portions are large at all the sit-down places we went-several times we split meals. We also ate at the Spice Market Buffet at the Alladin which was pretty good, but still liked Mandalay Bay's better. Nice PF Changs at the Alladin as well. The last night we were there we even took advantage of the bowling alley upstairs from the casino as something different to do! That was really fun and much bigger than I would have thought! (There was coupons for that in our \"Fun Book\" too.) We rented a car, so getting anywhere we wanted was never an issue. The covered parking lot/garage was popular since it was so hot out, but we were always able to find a spot. The pool was a great afternoon break from the casinos & sightseeing...lots of chairs/space and nice decor. They have towels available there so you don't have to bring your own. Also there were drinks and snacks available by the pool which was nice. (We only had drinks.) We drove out to Hoover Dam, took the tour, and enjoyed that as well. Don't waste your time waiting to see the \"pirate\" show at TI (Tresure Island) ...boring and cheesy. The fountain show at Bellagio was much better. Make sure if this is your first visit that you sign up for the various \"slot clubs.\" We got bonus sign-up points, and even a free t-shirt (NIce!) at the Rio. The magazine \"What's On\" is the best source of info on happenings in Vegas. We found them free at several places. Also we went to Madame Tousseau's Wax Museum at the Venetian...really cool!

We requested a higher room and got the 13th floor first, and the 19th floor for our second stay. The beds were fine, we didn't find them uncomfortable at all. The rooms were large, with a small sitting area near the window. The bathroom was also fine, and quite large. The door to the bathroom is quite heavy, and it would be nice to have it situated between the toilet and sink area, but that would be a major reno, and actually the door style fit into the decor. The casino is fine, but coming from a Province where smoking is banned in most public places, and as we aren't smokers, it was difficult to get used to. But all the casinos are like that, so if you can't take the smoke, we suppose you shouldn't go to Las Vegas. The restaurants in the Orleans range from poor to excellent. The Court Yard Cafe was our worst experience. We went for breakfast, and had cold, thin toast, and poorly prepared eggs. (How do you botch up scrambled eggs?) We never went back. And for the price, you can eat at the Buffet, and get basic eggs, or omelets prepared as you like. And the price was almost the same. The Buffet was also great for dinner, with a wide selection, and a coupon for a cheap bottle of wine was also nice. The Italian restaurant was fabulous, with quality food, and large portions. And Don Miquels, the Mexican restaurant, was also very tasty on the one occassion we tried it. Terribles was also fast food, but was fine, expecially with the use of the coupon the hotel gives you. There is also Seattles Best Coffee, and a pastry location for a change of pace. The Pool was great, roomy and clean. And it stayed open until 7:00 PM. We rented a car for this trip, as in between visits at the Orleans, we drove to the Grand Canyon, so kept the car the entire time. So we never used the shuttle to get to the strip, but others did, and there wasn't any complaining that we heard of. And finally, Security was great. They were regularly in the parking lot, and were outside the elavator area, checking for room keys.

We stayed on the 5th floor of the renovated tower which had updated amenities and a great bathroom. [Thanks to all of you for the reviews!] Took us about 24 hours to regulate the A/C so that we didn't freeze or blow hot air on ourselves. My husband brought a pillow based on some past reviews of this place, but I used them and they were fine - about what you would expect. We rented a car and used the covered parking garage in the back, which helped keep the car cool despite the 105+ degree heat we had every day. We ate only at the Courtyard Cafe at the Orleans (mostly for breakfast/brunch) while we spent the day sightseeing at other casinos. Food was fine, waitstaff great. In fact, everyone there on our stay ws gracious. Room keys tend to de-magentize sometimes - I had to re-key mine. We ate out at other places during the day (Bellagio buffet - always consistently great. Alladin Spice Market - good variety but very unevenly done food) and here's a tip: if you're like us we ended up eating more and richer foods than we usually do in our non-vacation time. One of our party suffered cramps but someone had brought along Immodium AD and things got better a lot faster. It probably doesn't help as effectively or quickly if you get food poisoning but if you're getting ready to indulge (food or drink), do you and your fellow travelers a favor and tuck a few medications in your suitcase! Here's what we liked the best: 1) Renting a car gave us the freedom to explore different parts of the Strip and Henderson. Since it was hot no one wanted to walk far. Even though we knew about the shuttle, we didn't use it, but we saw it in action. We didn't get downtown this trip. We've used public transportation on past trips here and have had surly, crabby drivers, and while it's not a bad way to get to where you need to go we much preferred the relatively stressless freedom of the car. (We did not drive on the Strip much but found all the back ways to get everywhere when possible). 2) We visited other casinos, from the Casino Royale, Alladin, Bellagio, Wynn, and the Palms, and even the Skyline Restaurant and Casino in Henderson (the restaurant apparently is a local favorite so on a whim we took a trip out there. It's the only place we gambled at that still takes coins). While we didn't expect all the same payouts or level of service, time and again we came back to the Orleans to gamble because the payouts seemed better, the cocktail waitresses were ALWAYS coming around (god bless 'em, and please tip them), and it was convenient and not pretentious. I won jackpot on the 5 cent video poker for about $265 and never quite won as much again, but more importantly, when I lost, I didn't lose big. At the end of trip we had breakfast in the Courtyard Cafe and used my Club Card slot points towards the bill - cut the bill in half and was a good way to redeem the points. 3) We saw \"O\" and scored first row balcony ticketsfor $99 by reserving 120 days in advance. It was the highlight of our trip. Face it, you can gamble that away and have no memory of what happened. Ask my husband. 4) Overall we had a great experience. We had stayed in the Luxor before this in April 2004 and found the Orleans to score consistently higher in value for the price. Before that we had stayed at the Golden Nugget and although we liked it alot, esp for the location, it was 110 degrees (August) and we didn't do a whole lot overall. We agreed that even though the hotel rates are attractive in the summer, we would rather come another time of year and get out of the city and explore Hoover Dam, Red Rock Canyon, Valley of Fire, Lake Mead, etc. It just didn't seem like a great idea on this trip. Next time, we will come another time of year, and get to Rio this time for the buffet.

It was a little pricey, but hard to find suites with a physically separate bedroom, that is the main reason we chose the Orleans, also that it had a Movie Theater on site. The Suite was a little dated, but very large. There is a living room area with a full size wet bar with stools etc, also a dining room type table. The bedroom was quite large and had a small desk. The bathroom is very LITTLE. Barely big enough for the toilet and shower/tub. The sink is outside the bathroom in the bedroom area. The tub has a very high ledge you need to step into, which was annoying, especially since room was tight. The suite was on the 20th floor that you needed to use your room key in the elevator and at a gate on the floor. There were consistently problems with the key working in elevators and the gate. I heard the same from others staying on the floor. Maid service was great. We were up early because of our kid, we would leave and come back around 10am, and the room was always cleaned. All of the staff we encountered were helpful and extremely nice, we didn't have any issues with service. We arrived around 1pm on a Saturday, checkin was a little slow, they only had 3 people at the desk. The buffet was pretty good for the price, as well as the courtyard cafe (open 24 hours). TGI Fridays and Subway are in the hotel as well. Seatles Best is a good place to get coffee and muffins etc (no doughnuts). They open at 5 am. There is a KidsTyme childcare on site. We didn't use it because of our childs age, but wanted to clear up some stuff. There is various amounts of info on different web sites and books. They take children from 3-9 years of age, they must be potty trained. Also, you have to have immunization records. The facility looked like it would be really cool. We didn't have any issues with walking through the casino (here or anywhere else in Vegas) with our 19 month old. As long as you keep moving and don't loiter or try to gamble. The Casino is ok, not a great selection of newer slot machines. Table games are cheap most of the time. My luckiest machines were the hot shots progressive machines. The comp system is pretty stingy, compared to other casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Get the free coupon book when you check in, there are percent off coupons for subway, gift shop, seatles best etc. The pool area is pretty basic, but was a good place to hang out, especially since it was 100 degrees while we were there. We parked outside once, there were grasshoppers all over the car in the morning. Park in the garage behind the hotel by the orleans arena. When you come out of the elevators from the garage, it is a long walk through the casino around to the rooms. There are unmarked exit doors in the large hallway at the end, if you walk through them, you cut through a courtyard and end up by the gift shop.", "Date": "May 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "1", "Value": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, CA", "Title": "\u201cNot a great hotel\u201d", "Author": "SoCalTrekker", "ReviewID": "UR5204868", "Content": "I am quite surprised at the good reviews posted on this site about the Orleans.

The Interior: Ironically, the inside of the Orleans is gawdy and loud (both in sound and in color). Best described as Mardi Gras gone wrong (very wrong). The interior felt dated and old. Check-In: Standard check-in, no problems. Room: Probably the worst part of the Hotel. The rooms are extremely old and looks like a room at Motel 6.

This is a budget hotel but I was nicely surprised. First of all the room was very clean. Nicely decorated. Every room has a nice view of Vegas. Elevators are quick and there is great security - no one gets on an elevator unless they have a room key. As a woman alone I greatly appreciated this aspect. I had a room with 2 double beds. Crisp sheets. My only complaint was the mushy bed. But I slept fine every night. Skimpy pillows, but they didn't bother me. Superb working air conditioner. It was extremely quiet. I could not even hear my friends in the room next door at all! Never heard anyone below or above me. This is all important to me when traveling. The room was spacious and included a cute living area with couch and coffee table, lamps, etc. Bathroom included dressing area. All very clean. Cable TV and web hook ups. I ordered up a refrigerator (also very clean) for $15 extra per night. Room had iron and board. There is a TGIF restaurant downstairs, a bowling alley, movie theaters, and an adequate cafe and buffet. Although I liked the cafe much better than the buffet, the breakfast buffet was only $6.99 and had everything from biscuits and gravy to eggs benedict to pancakes and waffles and chinese and mexican food too! Parking was free except for the tips. Bellmen were quick and efficient and friendly. I tried room service once and it was fast and server was very nice. Found out later from taxi drivers that all the \"Coast Hotels\" (Orleans, South Coast, Barbary Coast and Gold Goast) have the best gambling. I believe it. I gambled every night and won more than I played every time. Loved those Monopoly games! There is a shuttle between the coast hotels for free every 30 minutes. For the price and cleanliness and safety - I highly recommend. Only a short drive to the strip.

The one critisism i do have is the shuttle bus waiting area outside the hotel. There is NO queing system. So, on several occassions after waiting for the shuttle for 10 mins, people who had just arrived would push in & jump on the shuttle before us, leaving us stranded for the nxt bus to arrive. Saying that though, the shuttles were very frequent.

I was kind of leary of the hotel because a lot of the reviews I had read were over a year old and I know a lot can happen in a year. We had an awesome room rate (AARP) and the hotel and rooms were everything they were said to be. I had seen pictures on the net, but I figured those great rooms were for the 'high rollers'---of which we are not. But we got a room that looked just like one of the pictures. We had a king size bed, with a 25\" TV (not a big choice in TV channels, but hey--did I go there to watch TV??? NOT!!) Several people commented about the doors into the bathroom and I didn't quite understand what they meant, but after seeing it, I do. You have a door that goes into a room that has the sink/counter, place to put your suitcases and hang clothes, then you have another room off that with the toilet and shower/tub. There is no door separating the 'sink room' from the 'shower room'. There is also no hot lamp or any way to heat that room (other than turning on the room heat) unless you turn on the blow dryer and lay it on the floor. As it is everywhere, there is a long walk from where you park inside to your room. Someone else mentioned parking in the parking garage which is a good idea--you don't have to walk all the way through the casino that way.. The parking garage is around back behind the arena. They gave us a fun book on checkin (which was smooth at 3 PM) and in there was a coupon for french fries and a Pepsi (Pepsi owns that town by the way---not a Coke or Dr Pepper in site)with the purchase of a sandwich at Terrible Mikes, which is in the casino. So that was our dinner. We each ordered a hamburger for about $3.69 I think and used the coupon---well unless you are really hungry, skip using the coupon and just order the burger and a drink--that thing was HUGE and for us, we could have ordered 1 and split it and it would have been enough. But it was so good!!! And the fries??? They were huge too--they are in a little cardboard box and it was full to overflowing--there was enough FF in 2 orders for 4 hungry teenagers. Be sure whereever you go, get the players cards, earn your points---if you get enough, you can cash in the points for your meals and other things. We actually only bought at full price about 3 meals the whole time we were there--the rest were comped 100% or a couple we had 2 for 1 on the buffet. Oh yeah, the Courtyard Cafe--for breakfast, they bring you little squares of coffee cake-like an appetizer-it is really delicious. This Hotel is about 3 miles off the strip, it is well decorated in the Mardi Gras theme and we would consider staying there again. On the way in--the highway that is going through/over/around Hoover Dam is under construction until 2008---you can still get through on the crowded 2 lane road as before, but they are building a highway that will bypass the Hoover Dam. I saw a sign somewhere that said no trucks or buses allowed--they have to go down another highway out of Kingman and pass Laughlin to get into Vegas--but I did see some trucks and a bus going through there--but it didn't take too long to get through all that.", "Date": "April 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, RI", "Title": "\u201cGreat value\u201d", "Author": "Boztel", "ReviewID": "UR4990871", "Content": "Stayed one night at the Orleans (second visit here) on 16 Apr.

After staying there for a couple of nights during a weeklong Vegas trip, I think I may understand why. And that's why this review falls under the category of horrific pan. I've been going to Vegas regularly for the past 7 years and have stayed at Excalibur, MGM Grand, Paris, Aladdin, Circus Circus, and now The Orleans; and The Orleans is the most disappointing by far. The Strip hotels compete ferociously for your dollar and will most definitely reward a good player with generous comps including room, food, and show tickets. The Orleans is off-strip and is apparently targeted to locals and those who may not be \"serious players.\" For example, during our stay at The Orleans, we played as consistently as we have at the above-mentioned Strip hotels and whereas we would get rooms comped and food comped at these hotels (for example, at the Aladdin, we were given show tickets that had a total face value of over $350), The Orleans would only offer us a grand total of $36 off of our bill; they wouldn't even comp our room after we had put in several thousand dollars of play in their very smoky casino (and no, we didn't walk away with any winnings). So basically, our experience was that we got a much better value staying at the \"more expensive\" hotels on the Strip, than the more \"value-conscious\" Orleans. Ironic, huh? What's also odd about the reviews is that if you're visiting Vegas from out of town, then why wouldn't you stay at the Strip? After all, that's where the \"Vegas\" attractions are. Sure you can get a bowling alley and a movie theater in the hotel with the Orleans; but you don't get the Bellagio fountains; the Eiffel Tower with the breathtaking views from the top; the roller coaster at NYNY; the amazing shops at Caesars Palace and Aladdin's Desert Passage; the pirate show at TI; the Dolphin Habitat and White Tigers at the Mirage; the Shark Reef at Mandalay Bay; and not to mention the four- and five-star restaurants to choose from. I mean, I'm sorry but I've got a movie theater and a bowling alley where I live. Why would I fly to Vegas just to go bowling and see a movie there? Again, where's the value for the Vegas vacationer? If you're going to Vegas to see how human ingenuity and drive could create such an amazing metropolis of light and sound in the middle of the desert, then you need to pay a little extra (and probably not even that much extra) and find a place to stay on the Strip. If you just want a cheap place to stay where your kids can be amused so that you can do a little gambling without having to be inconvenienced by the fact that you need to go outside, then the Orleans is for you. And if you're going to be doing any gambling at all, then make sure to sign up for those casino players cards. All the casinos keep track of every penny you play and whether you win or lose, as long as you show a willingness to play, you will get rewarded. With all the consolidation going on, there aren't that many cards that you have to sign up for. For example, the Mandalay Group owns Mandalay Bay, Excalibur, Luxor and CircusCircus. So if you sign up for their One card, you get rewards that can be used in any of their hotels. Depending on your level of play, you may not be able to get comps for their top-level property of Mandalay Bay, but you may find you can easily get nights and/or food at Excalibur, CircusCircus or Luxor. The group that the Orleans belongs to has only one property on the Strip, The Barbary Coast.

The rooms are large and comfortable. Check in was quick and efficient. There is security at the elevators which means that only hotel guest can get to the floors with rooms, swimming pool etc which give a feeling of extra security. Our room was spotlessly clean and housekeeping did an excellent job each day and were very helpful when we asked for extra's for our room. There is a 18 screen cinema, 70 lane bowling alley, games rooms, lovely swimming pool etc - so there was plenty to keep our teenager occupied, which can be a problem in some of other Vegas hotels due to the 21 age limit in the casinos (under 21's can't \"loiter or linger\" in casino or bar areas!). Take advantage of the book of coupons you get on arrival - free cocktails, discounts on some of the restaurants and a $1 bet at Keno (I won $160 on my first bet).

I booked two nights during the busy Springbreak weekend and got rates of 120 a night for Friday and Saturday through Orbitz. I had an open mind but was hoping to be surprised. Firsthand I liked the parking being in front of the hotel (plus covered parking on back). Check-in was a breeze and got a nice room with a King in a non-smoking floor (floor 19). I also got two coupon books at check-in that included two free beers and a cocktail plus other freebies and discounts. There is also a liquor store inside with reasonable priced beer and booze. They had just opened a TGI Fridays and ate there twice. They have happy hour prices for appetizers daily and domestic drafts are 2.50 all day. There was also a leaflet in my room offering 2 free tickets (regularly 39.00) for their headliner that night (Rich Little). I went to sleep that first night a very happy guest. Next day I tried their free shuttle to the strip and took it back to my nice room for a nap with no problems. Later that night I drove my own car to see a concert (less than five minutes away) at the Mandaly Bay. Overall, I loved the stay and will recommend this place to anyone who'll listen.

My family (10yr. and 14yr. old girls) and I checked in on Sunday (4/9) and stayed through Friday (4/14). Check in was a breeze, we were even let in to our room 2 hours ahead of their posted check-in time of 3pm. Their standard room is over sized with sitting area and had an excellent pool view. We all thought the beds were comfortable, even though there were too few pillows (good thing the kids brought their own). The room was clean and maid service was consistent. One note is that there is not an in-room safe which I always appreciate. Ironing board, hair dryer, etc. were there. This is your standard hotel room, not a 5 star resort - so make sure your expectations are realistic. Property overall was nice. The pool area was fantastic - nice spa, warm pool, good mix of shade and sun, nice people. Dennis, at the pool bar, was an awesome bartender. Valet was packed and very slow, so I self parked in the garage which was always empty and closer to the hotel elevators than valet anyways. We took advantage of the movie theater, arcade and bowling alley - which made this a nice 'family' spot. Still had time to hit the tables after the kids went to sleep. The French Market Buffet had the best breakfast buffet I have ever had. Lunch and Brunch were mediocre at best. The smoked/BBQ pork ribs on Sunday were excellent and then on Friday they were so-so. About the only complaint I had was that on Friday we showed up at 10:05 AM ready to eat that awesome breakfast buffet (joe's special eggs if you like spinach) and found the buffet closed until the lunch seating at 11 AM. Sazio was the only other restaurant we tried and it was reasonably priced and good, but nothing special. Check out was easy.

I kind of doubt that, as many people were behind us checking in and I doubt that they all had picked doubles. The staff was not friendly and mostly said \"this is the way it is so accept it\". After we got to our room, we asked for extra pillows as they only had 2 very flat pillows on the bed and we have bad backs and I have asthma so need my head raised when I sleep. They said they don't give extra pillows and were ready to just hang up but my husband was not happy at this point and reminded them that we also didn't get the room we chose and paid for (according to their website) and they said they would see if they could get us some pillows. They did call back and said we could have some extra pillows but nothing else. Where is the customer service here? The beds have mattresses which are about 3-4\" thick and look like a mattress for a fold out couch. Very cheap. They also had sheets that were too short for both beds and a mattress pad that was about 1/3 too small for the whole bed. All this was miserable when sleeping as they got all bunched up.

I have stayed at other hotels in Vegas, both on and off the strip, and The Orleans is comperable. My main reason for staying there this trip was the price - The Orleans was cheaper than anywhere else. The rooms were good size and included a sitting area - couch, chair, table with lamp, and coffee table. The bathroom was good size as well but prefer that hotels have the toilet and tub/shower in a seperate room as the sinks and vanity area (the Rio is set up like that and it is great, especially when sharing the room with non-family). The rooms were VERY CLEAN - the housekeeping staff does an excellent job both inside the rooms and in the halls (in other hotels would see room service dishes sitting on the hall floor outside doors for several days, but not the case at The Orleans). I can vouch for the cleanliness of the bathroom - the first morning I forgot to put the shower curtain inside the tub, so there was a small pond that I mopped up with the white towels - there was not one speck of dirt on the towels when I finished (was VERY impressed!). The Orleans has a nice pool area, although we did not have oppurtunity to use it. Parking was easy - we rented a car - whether parking in the lot out front or in the garage. If parking in the garage, however, remember to ask the shortcut way between the room elevators and the garage so you don't walk all the way through the casino (did that once and thought there had to be a better way!). The Orleans has lots of restaurants to choose from and we ate at 3, but I was not all that impressed. The only one I would eat at again would be the Courtyard Cafe - the food was good but I thought it was a little pricey. I did not like the French Market buffet at all - have eaten at way better buffets for less money. A few thing about The Orleans I did not care for - the casino was smokey, not as good of ventilation as other places. They also charge for extras that I feel should be included with your stay, such as, charging to use the fitness center and for the in-room coffee (the first single cup filter pack is free but they charge $1.75 for each one after that). The room we stayed in was on the east side so we had a view of the strip, but it was also the side with the delivery docks so it was loud in the morning.

Well to our pleasure the reviews were correct and all was well for us at this hotel. We had two rooms on the 4th floor. From check in to check out everyone we dealt with was very friendly and helpful. There was no wait to check in and the person helping us at check in arranged it so that our two rooms were on the same floor same wing with out even asking.

The first evening their we signed up for their players\u2019 card, later when my husband put his card in the poker machine it did not work. Almost immediately someone noticed our distress came over took the card some where to be fixed and brought it back to us within 5 min. Wow they seem to really be on top of things.

That being said the bathroom is large, bright, clean and well stocked with towels etc. Parking is a breeze and the lots have very close access to the elevators so not as much walking to get back to the room as other casinos.

The first thing we both noticed upon entering was the amount of smoke in the air of the lobby/casino. We booked our room and made our way to the elevators and our room as fast as possible. Thankfully, the hotel has \"No Smoking\" floors not just rooms. Our room on the 19th floor had a wonderful view of the strip, the Stratosphere and Rio Hotels in particular. My wife loved the little operable window in the bathroom. The room did have problems, though, as we discovered during the first night there. The toilet wouldn't flush (no water to the tank), and the cold water faucet did not work at the hand sink. We called the front desk before leaving for the strip that night, and when we got back, all was working. However, while taking a shower, it became quickly evident that the shower drain was very, very slow. We called the front desk the following day before leaving for Red Rock Park, and a maintenance man was at the door within 5 minutes, before we had even left. Our second night at the hotel we decided to order room serice. That was a mistake. The menu in our room wasn't current. The lady with room service said that she would send a current menu up immediately, which evidently meant 40 minutes (quite a difference from maintenance). Then it took another 50 minutes to receive the food despite a promise of 40 minutes or less. The food itself was average. Our third night we ended up getting a burger at Terrible Mike's in the Casino. It was a build your own burger set up where you put the toppings on the burger yourself. This was one of the best burgers I have had in a long time. I highly recommend Terrible Mike's if you eat at the Orleans. We did not try any of the other on-site dining. Also, the on-site liqour store has an adequate selection with prices much lower than I expected to see at a hotel. In summary, though the room had many problems, they were fixed immediately. We had a great view from the 19th floor, and Terrible Mike's offers a great burger. The drawbacks were the amount of smoke in the casino (more than any of the strip casinos that we entered), the initial problems with our room, and the room service.

Based on the large number of positive reviews here and the affordable cost I booked 2 rooms for 6 nights from Feb. 8 to 14th and passed on hotels like the MGM, Riviera, Luxor, Imperial Palace, Bally's......

Both rooms had 2 queen sized beds and the hotel was happy to provide us with additional pillows in a prompt fashion. We had no problems with room cleanliness. New personal care products (shampoo, shower gel, conditioner & lotion) were delivered daily, along with sufficient towels. The room had a great view of the Last Vegas Strip which was even better at night. With a small sofa and comfy chair, we had room to relax somewhere other than on the bed. We used the hotel's internet access for $10.99 in order to keep up with business emails. Access was easy although it did \"time out\" occasionally. Breakfast at the hotel's cafe was great. With a piece of great chocolate chip coffee cake for an \"appetizer\", breakfast was delightful. The cafe offers a Chinese menu as well as traditional American selections. I strongly suggest that you avoid the Chinese selections in favor of the traditional menu. The hotel's Canal Street Grill is wonderful. We ate there twice. We received great food & wonderful service both times. My son swore by the sushi at the sushi restaurant, and made special trips downstairs several evenings for it.

During my most recent visit, I took my wife. She had great luck on their poker machine. The strip hotels seem to rip the customers off on bottled water and cokes. The Orleans 24 hour gift shop sold 20 ounce bottles of water and soda for $1.35 per container. So many wonderful restaurants, but what really impressed me was the specials in the coffee shop. About ten dollars for a steak or prime rib meal including a huge wonderful salad. That was not a late hour price, but available at all times. Oh and don't forget the plump hot dogs at 75 cents! If you're a senior you can buy a bus pass for 24 hours for $1.25. The buses run every 15 minutes and will get you to the Strip in a very short time. This hotel also has their own shuttle which will take you to the Strip. I've been coming to Vegas for over 30 years. In the 1970's Vegas was a generous place where the consumer really got value for their dollar. Today most of the hotels in Vegas charge an arm-and-a-leg and really rip-off the consumer. The Orleans is a wonderful exception where the customer is treated with the respect and dignity that the consumer deserves.

Lo and behold for the first time in Vegas there was a coffee maker in the room. There was a sign next to it that said you were allowed one cup and if you desired a second then it would be $1.75. There was one paper cup and a one serving coffee and 1 tea bag. OK coin toss as to who gets the coffee (neither of us wanted it). Ate breakfast at the Buffet in the french market for $6.95. You get what you pay for. My meal was so cold I thought it might be frozen. Stick to the cereals, fruits and the yummy desserts and it is worth it. Casino was not too smoky (we are non-smokers) but there seemed to be way too many nickel machines and way too many smokers near them. Drinks were very small and watered down.

Having visited the city several times and stayed in everything from the Motel 6 to the Luxor, I'd rate the Orleans right about in the middle even though its rates are more comparable to the latter. I was particularly disappointed to find that I could have stayed at the MGM or Luxor for actually LESS than here at this specific time of year. Here are the highs and lows in a nutshell: Positives: Rooms are a little larger than most other hotels and are tastefully furnished. French Market Buffet is very good for all meals and a good value. The Fun Book they provide to each guest at check-in has a lot of good deals in it, including several free drinks at the various bars in the casino. Shuttle to Barbary Coast is convenient if you lack your own transportation. (Note: A taxi from the airport runs about $20.) Despite earlier reviews about the smoke in the casino, I found it about average for Vegas. Overall, the building feels fairly well-kept and safe. Negatives: You get the feeling that the management cuts corners in obvious ways. There actually are coffee makers in the rooms now, but they will charge you $1.75 per cup after you use the initial day's allotment of coffee (this is regardless of whether you're staying one night or a week). There is high-speed internet in the rooms, but it'll run you $10.99 a day. Housekeeping often skimps on the bathroom goodies, such as new soap each day, missing conditioner on the first day, etc. The player's club comps are not nearly as generous or enticing as some of the strip casinos. Our non-smoking room, located on a \"non-smoking\" floor, was quite smoky-smelling, although a friend's room a few floors higher did not have this problem. The Orleans seems to cater to large groups and conventions, especially those that involve youths since its location away from the strip makes it a little harder for them to get into trouble, I guess. Because of this, it's sometimes mega-crowded when other places aren't. Unfortunately, our stay was during one of those times and we experienced long waits for elevators and noisy groups of kids without chaperones clogging up walkways. A note about its supposedly \"away-from-trouble\" location though. There's a new topless strip club right across the street now and an adult video/toy store diagonally across from the main entrance. Guess those could be a positive or negative depending upon your tastes! In general, I just didn't have as much \"fun\" at the Orleans as I'd experienced at other hotels closer to the strip or on Fremont Street. Unless you are able to find a really great rate here (which they sometimes do have, as I understand), you will likely be able to find a better value and experience on the strip.", "Date": "January 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cGot the scabies in the Orleans\u201d", "Author": "yoh972", "ReviewID": "UR4399309", "Content": "No doubt the orleans is a good value hotel, but this is also the catch.

As it turns out, I only brought four kids, leaving two behind with the ex. Be that as it may, the Orleans was the perfect place for both mother and child to co-exist. The rooms were spacious with two queen beds and a couch in an adjoining area. We asked for a view of the strip and got it easily. While I shuffled along gambling and using my coupons from the neat coupon book I received upon checking in, two of my kids went to the movies in the inhouse theater and two went bowling in the inhouse bowling alley. Later, they went to the huge arcade and had a grand time. The buffet was marvelous. I couldn't imagine anything more they could have served us. It included everything from shrimp (my fave) to barbecue to lo mein to pasta to tacos to crawfish (didn't eat those) and the most decadent desserts. With the coupon book, I also got a free bottle of wine with dinner. One more thing not to miss, and this is for adults only, is the spa. My feet were killing me from too much walking and driving the day before and I headed down there in the morning and had the luxurious accomodations all to myself. New Age music and bubbles in a huge jacuzzi big enough for me, my family and eight other families, lulled me into such nirvana. Massages and other treats are also available at reasonable prices. The pool looked very nice and tropical, but it was only open from 10 to 5 and we were always out somewhere at that time so we didn't get to try it. It was a bit nippy out anyway. The Orleans is off the strip but not too far. You're on the side of the Luxor and the MGM, but I would not advise walking there, especially with kids.

I stayed at the Orleans for six nights from January 8th-15th, 2006 (One night stayed at Farmer's Daughter in Los Angeles when I was on The Price Is Right game show). There is a reason why this hotel received the Trip Advisor award for best bargain-because it is! I only paid $50 per night for five night and $120 for another and I heard from other patrons that they paid even less booking through other websites. The hotel is close to the strip but you probably won't want to walk because the city blocks are huge. I rented a car at the airport and drove everywhere easily. Las Vegas is very easy to navigate around and the strip is very busy so I suggest to bypass the strip on a parallel street once you drive up and down the strip a few times to soak in the experience. If you are going for a week, I suggest you drive to the Hoover Dam which is an easy 30 minute drive and to Los Angeles which is a long 3-4 hour drive but the scenary is excellent-and you get to see rams! The hotel itself is on par with all the other 3-4 star hotels on the strip and has most amenities that one could ask for. Check-in was easy and you can check out using the tv in your bedroom. The evevators are fast and are split up so certain ones only cover certain floors-for added speed. The hallways are very long so I suggest you ask for a room near the elevators. Even being close to the elevators, there wasn't a lot of noise. The rooms are larger than average with a couch and armchair and the bathroom is large granite countertops. The shower is excellent and the water pressure was great. I suggest that anyone who blowdrys their hair to bring your own blowdryer as the one that is supplied is insufficient. My girlfriend told me this as my head is shaved and I didn't use it. The bed is comfortable and the room is clean and in good repair. I used the gym everyday and it was good. The cost is $10/day or $25/3 days but you get two days for free using the coupon inside the \"Fun Book\" they give you. This is a deal as most other 4-5 star places charge $25-$30/day for their respective gyms. The Orleans has many restarants and I ate at a few of them. Get to the breakfast buffet before 10am because that's when it ends. It's only $6.45 and it's the best in vegas. Sunday brunch is $12.95 and has food from all three meals. The cafe's food was good and everynight (Monday to Thursday) after midnight, there are 4-5 specials that are great such as steak and eggs for $2.99. I didn't eat in any of the higher end restarants but they looked excellent. The casino is large and up to date but I found it smokier than other casions and getting a drink from the waitresses was hard to do. The staff was polite and housekeeping was there quickly when I called them. The Orleans also has an ice rink, 18-screen movie theatre, arcade, and excellent parking (both valet and self-serve). If you have a rental car, the strip is only a two minute drive from the Orleans. If you chose not to get a rental car, the Orleans has a free shuttle to their sister hotels and the Barbary Coast is located right in the middle of the strip. In conclusion, I highly recommend the Orleans and everything else that all the other reviews say is true. The Orleans is great-just a little smoky in the casino.

We ended up getting a cab, which cost $9 including tip. Shuttle drivers were rude. Hotel would not reimburse us for the cab fare. Sure would have been nice if they would have offered us something. Drink service was OK in the casino, but the mixed drinks were watered down (tipped $1 per drink per round). OK place to stay if you're brave enough to rent a car and drive.

My husband and I have stayed at the Luxor previously, (and still would if the price was right) but our budget was more limited on this stay, which meant that we would have to stay 'off strip'. That, and the previous reviews on this site for The Orleans were the main reasons for chosing this hotel.

So I had a room for 3 nights for $24 a night. We checked into the hotel on Christmas day, and found our room very large, clean and with a king size bed! The bed though was very very hard and made for a very uncomfortable nights sleep. So the next morning I went to the front desk and asked if they had any softer beds, and they said that they have upgraded rooms, with very comfortable beds, a coffee maker and view of the Vegas strip for $10 more per night. Sounded like a good deal, so we changed rooms for the extra two nights. What a view from the hotel room! Because of where the hotel sits, you have a full view of all of the Vegas Strip with all of its lights! The Bed was very comfortable, and every shower in the hotel has a little window that you can open, or just look through while you are showering!! Food was very good and very reasonable.

They had to replace the whole unit and it took no more than 20 minutes to fix. There is plenty to do here at this hotel. There is a bowling alley on the top level,arcade, a movie theatre with 18 screens, spa, salon, workout room and a lovely pool. The restaurants are fabulous, I recomend Sazio for dinner and the Courtyard Cafe has a wonderful breakfast. The main reason why I stayed here at this particular hotel/casino was for the entertainment, Burt Bacharach was playing (yes, 21 and I like Burt Bacharach!) there that weekend and the deal I got for the show and the hotel was a steal, I highly recomend getting a show/room package if there's someone performing when you go for your stay.

This is THE only place I will ever want to stay! And not even for the price (which is great!), but for everything else. The rooms were exceptionally clean, spacious and comfortable. We usually take a room closer to the elevator and I have no complaints about noise. As a matter of fact, this is one of the quietest hotels I have stayed in anywhere. Security checks for room keys before you even get onto the elevators, which is a huge plus. I've been to other Vegas hotels in the past, and although they (sometimes) have security posted near the elevators, most would let you through without asking any questions. (Rio was always a good one for that). Plenty of places to eat at the Orleans and easy access to the Strip. One thing I really like about the Orleans is that you don't have the loud, crowded 'party' atmosphere that you sometimes find in the other hotels. It's fun, without being obnoxious. I read several reviews that it was smoky, and I'd have to disagree with that. Sure, there is some smoke in the air, but it's not stifling in the least. And I've never had a problem with it making my clothes smell. A couple other reviews said that the slots were tight. I've actually never had that problem. This past January, I stuck $20 into a slot machine and played on that money for almost 3 full days. I guess it depends what machines you play and how wisely you play them. If you're not winning - just stop playing, don't blame a casino for being tight. This is also a hotel where I felt completely safe, and didn't worry at all if I wanted to wander around the casino alone at 2am. Besides the security near the elevators, there is a strong presence of them throughout the casino. The cocktail waitresses were always around and it was never a problem to get a drink or a soda. The staff were all very courteous, accomodating and polite. One year we had a problem with our room and were quickly given another. Unfortunately that room had a very leaky faucet, which was fixed within a matter of 10-15 minutes. There is no hotel that is 100% perfect, and you have to expect problems sometimes. What makes the difference, though, is how quickly the problems are addressed. With the Orleans - I'd have to say their customer service.....in all areas.....is exceptional. I've never stayed in one of the suites, but had family members who did. They are WONDERFUL! If you don't mind shoveling out a few extra bucks, it's well worth it. If you're unsure about where you want to stay, try the Orleans. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. This is the only place I will stay, and will even pass up free rooms to do so.

I researched and read the reviews and I was convinced to book. Believe me, this is my fifth visit to Vegas in 2005 and have stayed at many other high end hotels. My first experience at the Orleans was great! WINTER ROOM RATE SPECIAL: First, the hotel rate that I got was amazing for three nights; the price per my whole stay was less than half the normal rate. To upgrade to a suite it would have cost me $50 extra a night but decided to stay at the standard room. Check in was fast and the live was very long. The valet parking is next to the hotel and is very convenient since is next to registration and main entrances to the towers are contiguous. In order to get access to the tower, you will have to show your room key to the security guard\u2026.very secured. I would also recommend taking advantage of the coupon book or asking for one. They gave us two coupon books that included six free drinks (in total) at the hotel, two drinks at the Barbary Coast and two at the Gold Coast. These two casinos are just a shuttle or car trip away. The book also contained discount for the bowling, free food, souvenirs and various discounts. ROOMS: The rooms are really big as described by other reviewers. They include a private sitting area with a coffee table next to a big window facing the south, strip or the mountains. If you are staying here and would line a view, I recommend staying above the 6th or 7th floors. The front of the casino blocks the view towards the south of the strip and Vegas from the 5th floor. The room service and maid service were very responsive and quick. Overall the rooms were very clean. Once again, the rooms are bigger than other standard rooms like the\u2026..would not mention but you get the picture. You or your guest would enjoy the couch, chair and table room when relaxing instead of standing up or on top of your bed. ENTERTAINMENT: The bowling alley was great, cheap and spacious. The movie theaters were great and inexpensive for the early part of the day. For those beer drinkers or just want to have chill quiet time drinking a brew, I recommend the Irish Pub. The pub is very decent in size and is clean and well attended. Just put at least 10 dollar in the bar machines and get comp for drinks and make sure you ask for a chicken tender plate for $5 to munch on. POOL: The pool and a medium size pool between the towers and parking lots (4 ft maximum I think). They also have a small pool for kids and a nice Jacuzzi/sauna. It was winter therefore we could not experience it fully. The feeling of being in between the nice looking towers and in the open inside the pool makes me think I will book my room for early summer 2006. LOCATION: Like I said, I have stayed at many hotel and casinos in Vegas and are use to rent or bring my own car. The Orleans is off strip on Tropicana and has access to all major streets that can take to any other casino in the strip without traffic. You should take advantage of the shuttle. I did not use since I had a car but I would recommend you want to go to the strip. The shuttle would taka you to the Barbary Coast in the middle of the strip. From there you can was up or down to the major casinos on the strip. Do not forget to bring your coupons for free drinks at the Barbary Coast when you visit. I come to Vegas at least three to five times a year for pleasure only.

There were tons of slots which seemed to pay good over the week we were there and the poker room was excellent. The buffet was excellent as well. The breakfast buffet was $6.45 per person and included coffee, juice etc and you had dozens of items to choose - from regular eggs, omelets, bacon etc to mexican, to chinese to italian etc etc. plus all the fresh fruits, salads etc. They even had desserts at breakfast. The buffet for lunch and dinner was awesome as well. Steak night on Wednesday was excellent and you could eat as much steak and shrimp as you want. Absolutely everything you could think of. If a person couldn't find something they liked, then there was definitely something wrong. The Prime Rib Loft was very good as well as the Japanese, Italian and the Pub. All were very good so a person could eat every meal at the Orleans and have quite a variety and the prices were very reasonable. The security guard checking for room keys before you reached the elevator was a nice touch and a good feeling. The shuttle to and from the strip was okay. We never had a problem and never had to wait more than 20 minutes. They do need to have more shuttles running since some only go to the Gold Coast and the Sun Coast. They could have more shuttles and a better system that would alleviate some of the wait time since there are only 19 seats on the shuttle and there is no standing. Some people did complain however it wasn't that bad and they are looking into getting a better service. Also you can take the bus (201) which stops across the street for $1.25 and it takes you to the strip by the Tropicana/New York New York so that's another option. If your walking the strip and looking at hotels etc be prepared top walk because you will be doing a lot of it.

The monorail is located behind the properties which didn't seem too bad at first however they are a looooonnnnnggggg way back there. It took us an hour to go from the Luxor to MGM and we could have walked it in 20 minutes. So in other words we walked an extra 40 minutes just to take the monorail. I would recommend taking The Deuce (bus) for $2.00 as it will take you up and down the strip. The Orleans also gives you a Funbook when you check in which has 2 for 1 dinner buffets, free drinks ( even though the coupon says Gold Coast, you can use it The Orleans, plus other coupons that will save you money. We didn't go bowling or see a movie in their theatres but we talked to people that did and they said both were very good. If you are looking for a friendly place to stay, with all the conveniences of a Strip hotel but at third the price, then this is a great hotel. We are planning a return visit in the spring.

Due to the unusually warm November weather, we were able to enjoy the beautiful outdoor pool area along with the rest of this hotel's many amenities! We enjoyed lounging in the bright sunshine and plunging into the cool pools after being in the warm island style (complete with waterfalls) Jacuzzi! Upon our arrival at 11am on Tuesday, we were welcomed promptly at the front desk and were afforded an early check in. We were assigned to room 924. This room is a standard non-smoking room with two queen beds. Unlike the rooms above the 12th floor, it has not yet been renovated. Because of the extreme cleanliness of the room, and the tasteful (but admittedly outdated) decor, we still found it to be a very tasteful, spacious room and a fantastic value for the money! Our room was appointed with a hairdryer & ironing board, but lacked an in-room coffee pot or safe. There is an area in the bathroom to hang clothes in lieu of a \"closet\" (which is great for steaming wrinkles)! There were no major signs of wear in the room. One could potentially be disappointed by this \"strip view\" room because it also overlooks an parking lot with huge lights, which are directed upward toward the hotel. This makes it somewhat difficult at night to actually see the strip because of the bright lights shining into your eyes. For us it was fine, but might be nice to know if you are making a specific room request. The rooms here are unique for Las Vegas, in that there is actually a window that opens (in the shower)! The pocket door entrance to the bathroom is located next to the sitting area which includes a couch, end table, lamp and chair. This area is in the rear of the room, instead of the front, which I found to be a refreshing change from a standard hotel room layout. The overall layout of the hotel is nice. You are able to get to both the pool and the parking garage without even entering the casino! There is a spa, a movie theatre, an arcade, a bowling alley and a daycare here in addition to the numerous coffee shops, bars and restaurants. Because we had a rental car, we did not use the complimentary shuttle to & from the strip. For me, I think the shuttle would be a fine substitution for a rental car during a short stay since I don't usually spend a great deal of time on the strip. Overall, I was very impressed with The Orleans. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were large and clean. There is plenty to do without ever leaving the hotel and sometimes it's nice to get away from the crowded hotels on the strip.

Negatives: Buffet food was bland to the point that we did not go back for a second meal despite having a free coupon for it. The shuttle service was disappointing. Catching the shuttle was a \"free for all\" with no designated place at the main entrance for it. Hence, a crowd just milled around for quite awhile. When the bus finally did show up, the people who just happened to be closer to where the bus stopped got on. The people who had waited the longest did not get seats. It seems that a simple \"line starts here\" sign would have helped immensely. One other thing that I am not quite sure how to classify. While I certainly do not expect to win, I do expect to buy some playing time with my money. It seems that every machine I played there just sucked up my money with no give backs.

We mainly booked because reviews told us it was good quality and value for money. However a few minus points - although the casino floor didn't appear as smokey as I expected after reading earlier reviews, it did affect my eyes (contact lens wearer) and our clothes always smelt smokey. Major problem with noise from the corridor - we would have liked to sleep in late, however were always woken up from 7am onwards due to other residents or the previously mentioned housekeeping. We asked to move, which they did arrange (up to 20th floor) but this was no better. I think the layout of the rooms (bathroom on the window side, rather than the corridor side) didn't help. Room itself was fine with comfortable beds, good sized tv, sofa and arm chair. Bathroom also fine, with a hanging rail for your clothes, and the 'opening' window. Whilst in the shower we could see the strip! All of the restaurants that we ate in (Prime Rib Loft, Don Miguels, the Chinese / sushi bar, Terrible Mikes) were great and very reasonably priced. Good value fun book also with good offers and freebies. Shuttle service was ok, but problems with waiting (anything from 15 minutes) in the blazing sun, with no shelter or seating area. Also other customers did not seem to understand the courtesy of queueing so sometimes it was a bit of a free for all to get on! On the few occasions that we did use it, we always got a seat, however we had a hire car so did not need to rely on it all of the time. It does drop you right in the centre of things at the Barbary Coast, opposite the Bellagio and Ballys. Only used the pool area once, which was fine, easy enough to find a sunbed, nice pools and decks. Security check your keys before you can get in the lifts, which is reassuring. Overall, I would recommend this hotel, if you don't want to sleep in late, or are sensitive to cigarette smoke.

The rooms are comfortable,very nice and large. The people at reception were friendly and efficient. The pool was a bit crowded at times but OK. We ate at the buffett once which was not too expensive and had relatively normal fare (Ie not too fancy but substantial) The casino is not very flashy compared to most other Las Vegas Hotels and didnt really conjure up the feeling of being in New Orleans. It appears they have not invested the same time or money into the decor that other hotels have and as a result looks a bit simple compared to others. While some people would welcome a pleasant but simpler place, I feel they could have done a better job with the theme decor. The energy and excitement level seems to be lower than on most strip locations. We did not have a car during our stay so were reliant on public transportation and the shuttle bus. The main problem was that it was not uncommon for us to wait 10 to 20 minutes outside in 100 degree weather for a shuttle or public bus which were occasionally full. A more frequent service or larger bus would help to reduce waiting times. Cant comment on the gambling as we dont gamble. Overall the Orleans is a pleasant hotel casino with nice rooms, reasonable food and service and somewhat simpler decor than many strip locations. I think it represents very good value for money. While a shuttle bus does take guests to the strip and back, with the present level of service I found the location a disadvantage without a vehicle.

At this point I have lost around $50 and I am confused. I ask him why he has embarrassed me in front of everyone at the table and within earshot. He says I was making bets that were an advantage to me. Again im confused im just in town for my anniversary playing some BJ. I say to him I don\u2019t understand and he states I was betting more money when it was to my advantage. I said im watching and when I see that the last hand had lots of small cards and not many big ones odds are next hand might be more likely to get 2 face cards so im more likely to win I thought so I bet some more money. This to me seemed like common sense. I was even using one of those BJ strategy cards to help remember the right time to hit etc. He said that betting more when I think I might win isn\u2019t allowed. So I left and canceled all my reservations at that hotel for the evening and we checked out the next day. I wrote a letter to their management but never got a response so im just letting everyone else know how they treat you. I played the exact same way when I was there the summer before and had no issues; I think I even won a couple hundred bucks that time so this seems as a selective and stupid way to treat paying customers for no reason.

Our rooms were ready despite the 4:00pm check-in. Staff was very friendly. The room was clean and the decor was ok. Our biggest complaints would have to be the door and slow drainage in the bathroom. The door is a big wooden sliding door that is extremely loud. I usually like to sleep in a little longer than my boyfriend and it was very difficult not waking up to the loud sliding door. If you like to play to the late hours in the casinos and think you are going to sleep in late, think again, housekeeping starts about 8:00-8:30am and can be heard clearly throughout the corridors. The atmosphere in the casino is definitely not your average casino on the strip. Two years ago we stayed at Treasure Island and enjoyed the classy atmosphere. We also visited most of the hotels on the strip. If you want a quiet, less crowded casino, The Orleans is the way to go. It is definitely kid friendly. They have a very large bowling alley and an arcade room for the children. They also have a great movie cinema which we utlized when we needed a break from gambling. As far as gambling goes, we played roulette and slot machines. It was amazing to find roulette tables at $1.00 minimum bets. The catch is the tables don't have the number displays, but overall, not bad. The first night my boyfriend played the $1 Wheel of Fortune slot machine and after a few spins, hit for $1,500 which was great! As far as the food is concerned, we really enjoyed the buffet. The food and desserts were pretty good. The price for the food was excellent. If you don't like being confined to the hotel you can take a 10 min cab ride to the strip for about $10.00. The hotel also has a free shuttle to the strip which we tried once. Not a bad ride, you get let off at the Barbary Coast Hotel. Overall, The Orleans was a great bargain.

I chose the Orleans because of the excellent rates and the great reviews on TripAdvisor. Also, I'm from NO, and I was interested in the NO themed decorations. I wasn't disappointed. PROS 1) The standard room was quite large, and very clean, with a small, separate sitting area. 2) The A/C worked very well, and we like it COLD for sleeping (went as low as 60F.) 3) The pool area was clean and well supervised by the life guards. There's a seperate kiddie pool, which my 7 yr old loved. The large hot tub is landscaped beautifully. The pool remains completely in the shade for most of the morning, which not everyone will like, but was great to me. Even after the sun finally makes it over the side of the tall hotel, a corner of the pool remains shaded. No sunburn! 4) The buffet (breakfast & dinner) is only of average quality, but the price made it worth our while. $6.45 breakfast/$12.95 dinner (No discount for kids, though.) 5) I didn't use the childcare facility, but another mother said she (and her daughter) were quite happy with it. 6) We enjoyed the bowling alley, as a family, and used coupons from the Orleans Funbook for free games. 7) The New Orleans themed, lighted decorations in the casino were great! 8) Security guards were very good about checking room cards for those going up in elevators. I'm sure a pro could have slipped past, but your casual thief probably would have been stymied. CONS (Only minor complaints.) 1) We were given a room right next to the elevator, but it was immediately changed without comment when I asked for another room. 2) Also, we had a coupon for 20% off merchandise in the gift shop, but it was for a minimum $25 purchase. We weren't allowed to combine receipts for items purchased literally 3 minutes apart that added up to more than $25, so we could get the 20% off. Not a big deal, but irritating. 3) Also, had a coupon for a free bottle of wine with purchase of 2 dinner buffets. But we got to the buffet late, and I didn't think to ask about the wine until the end of the meal. By then, there were few staff members around, and the 2 I asked could not (would not) help me, so another useless coupon. 4) The \"free\" shuttle only goes between the Orleans, the Gold Coast, and the Barbary Coast (on the strip) -- sister properties of the Orleans. It's not on a set schedule and stops at midnight. If you intend to travel much, a car would probably be desirable. 5) NO kiddie channels on TV!

We stayed on the 18th and 19th of Aug and we must say that it exceeded our expectations. The check-in was very fast, the staff was extremely friendly, and our room was clean. The coupon books the check-in clerk gave us was very helpful: from the free drinks at any bar; 20% off entire dinner bill at the italian restaurant, and much more. There are many things to do without leaving the hotel, from watching movies in the cinema to bowling in the 70 lane alley, to watching the lounge shows in the theater. Here are a couple of recommendations and a few complaints I did have about the hotel though. 1) Make sure that you either rent a car or are capable of waiting for a shuttle. I was fully aware of the 30-1 hour waiting period for a shuttle to take you to the strip, so I definetly recommend a rental to come and go as you please. 2) The layout of the hotel is not exactly navigation friendly: The parking garage is a bit of a walk to the hotel rooms, and can be confusing if you don't have a map of the hotel layout. Expect a 5-10 min walk from Room to elevator to parking garage; the security guard at the elevator lobby should help you in finding the parking garage. 3) We stayed in room 632 and I really only have 2 complaints. The first is that the water temperature of the showers was not hot enough; lukewarm at best. I know i may sound petty, but after being in the Vegas heat all day, you would like to have a hot shower or bath and relax for a bit before a night on the town. The second complaint (again about the bathtub) is that the shower drains very slowly, so that you are standing in a pond when you are taking a shower, and it was more annoying than bad, so take it with a grain of salt. 4) The gym is small,so either arrive very early to use the treadmills or go late a night. It's is not busy at any other times it just that there aren't enough machines to go around. 3 treadmills and 2 stairmasters; with a small assortment of free weights. When you do decide to go, make sure you bring your coupon for free admission to the spa, the staff person will ask you for that coupon as proof that you're a hotel guest, and you won't have to pay for that day, but you only get one day free, I believe it's $10 a day after the intial use. I hope you are able to enjoy yourself as my wife and I did, and make sure to take advantage of the free souvenir coupon when you check-in.

First I'll address the \"distance from the strip\" issue. Yes, it is a bit of a distance from the strip. My companion had never been to Vegas before so of course we had to make the trip to the main strip area. While the shuttle is free, we weren't really into meeting a schedule so we ended up taking a taxi each time. Not free - but cheaper than renting a car. What we found was that other than the obligatory \"we saw the strip\" - there was no reason to leave the Orleans. After visiting the strip hotels, we found that being away from the masses of people meant that the staff was friendlier, the casino was less crowded, and drinks were easier to get. Most of the hotels on the strip have \"minimum gambling dollar\" amounts for free cocktails. If you don't have at least $20 in a slot machine, for example, they charge you for the cocktail. We found this to be true in several of the major hotels. The Orleans was an absolute jewel. The rooms are huge and exceptionally clean. Room service is fast and very, very good. We tried each restaurant in the hotel except for the Mexican restaurant and found them to be top notch. As a matter of fact, I would venture to say that the dinner we had at Canal Street was one of the better dining experiences I have ever had. Tables in the casino are abundant and I never once had to look for a $5 blackjack table - and we were there on a weekend. Do yourself a favor and actually explore the whole casino floor when you get there. There were two or three sections I never evn knew about until later in the trip. We also hit the bowling alley and found it to be in very good shape. The place wasn't crowded (go during the morning or afternoon) and we had a great time.

If you do not mind being off the strip then the Orleans is for you! When you check in each is adult provided with a booklet offering discounts and freebies to use at the hotel. Such as free bottle of wine when ordering a meal at the Buffet Resteraunt, free games of bowling in their own alley, free drinks at the casino etc. Whilst this is an incentive to keep you at the hotel if you work it right it is a good idea for keeping holiday spending down. The pool is large and clean with plenty of loungers, the hot tub is huge roughly the size of a small swimming pool. The pool bar staff are friendly and it is well run with waitress service around the pool. My boys adored the pool but unfortunately due to a fast approaching thunderstorm the pool was swiftly closed for obvious safety reasons. This then gave us the opportunity to explore the hotel and have a couple of games of bowling. The bowling alley is again well run and has about 78 lanes it wasn't expensive either as we utilised the discount coupons. I thinks it cost us about $20 for two games each including shoe rental. The hotel also has its own Cinema showing the latest movies and also a kids club for when you need an hours piece from the little darllings. Whilst my children did not use it, it appeared well run and very safe with lots of things for kids upto the age of 12 to do. Numerous places to eat at reasonable prices, we chose to eat in the buffet and it was plentiful and varied and very good value. The casino is massive with many slots and gaming tables. Whilst I cant understand the slots I did have lots of fun on the roulette and Blackjack tables. All in all an excellent place to stay.

The hotel room was very nice and extremely spacious. We paid approximately $59/night which I think was an outstanding price given the quality of the hotel. The bowling alley and movie theater were great touches that helped make our first Vegas experience fun. However, like most first time visitors we wanted to spend a lot of time on the strip and this is difficult to do from the Orleans UNLESS you rent a car. On subsequent trips we rented a car and found it a MUST for enjoying Vegas (even if you are staying on the strip). After all, we go during the Summer months and most compact rental cars run only about $17/day. The only other downside to the Orleans is the Buffet. I'm the first to admit that things may have changed since we visited three years ago. At that time, we saw good reviews of the buffet and figured that we should try it since the price was great. All in all I found the food to be barely mediocre at best (and I'm not that picky). My advice is to pay more and go to one of the downtown buffets (Golden Nugget or Main Street) or hit of the more expensive ones buffets on the strip (like Alladin or the Flamingo). Better yet, visit the resturant at Ellis Island for the $4.99 24hour a day steak special! In summary, this is a GREAT inexpensive yet very nice hotel located off of the Vegas strip. If you're on a fairly tight budge this may be the best place for you.

The room was clean and large with a sofa area. Each room had its own thermostat so you can set your air conditioning to the temperature you wanted, not just low, medium, and high like most places. It was the only hotel we've been in with a window that actually opens in the bathroom. When I first heard about the window, I pictured an old place, but these windows are actually nice with flowers etched in them and you can get fresh air (when it's not too hot) and air out the place. The only thing that was missing when comparing to the strip hotels was an in room safe. But the guard downstairs was very vigilant in checking room keys before letting you go on the elevator. The buffet was ok and an improvement from our meal here 3 years ago. Nothing fancy, and for the price it was good. The meal we had at the Courtyard Cafe was very tasty. Katie's ice cream store was good for a late night snack (after a show) and with the coupon from the book they give you at check-in, you can get a good deal on the ice cream. Also, from the coupon book, we got half price tickets to the show and great seats. Gift shop was impressive for an off strip hotel and you get free beads with your coupon as well. If you want to start playing table games, this is a good place since they have low minimums. The shuttle runs regularly to the strip and the other Coast casinos and your player's card is linked to the others too. We even got some money deducted from our bill at checkout based on our play which was a real pleasant surprise since we have spent much more on the strip in the past and gotten nothing deducted.

Cafe - Cafe is open from about 10 pm to 7 am or something. Everything I ate in here was wonderful. I ate a seafood Chinese dish at 2 am and it was the best. They also have breakfast specials $1.99 Be prepared, it stays packed. Buffet: It was okay but nothing to write home about. Also, have deals for shows at other Casinos. Buy the Package Deal for dinner and show at the GoldCoast. I saw forever plaid and had a gourmet dinner in the Gold Coast Italian restaurant for $25.

Room highlight: great shower with a little window with a view of the Strip... nice way to start the day! The shuttles to and from the Strip were often crowded. Instead of waiting, we would usually ask another couple waiting if they wanted to split a cab. At $6 each ($12 including tip was the full fare), we were at the Strip in a couple minutes. The shuttles sounded fine until I saw how crowded they were... if there were more running, it'd be a great system. I did have my car with me and shaded parking was no problem, though I opted to park near the casino instead of near the check-in desk which could appear somewhat chaotic. Driving down to the Strip was easy and parking on the Strip is plentiful as all the casinos have free self-park.

The hotel is in great condition and you can tell they care about the upkeep. If you stay there, you'll need to keep a few things in mind. First, the location. The Orleans is well beyond walking distance to anything else including the Strip. Coast Hotels provides a shuttle between The Orleans, Gold Coast and Barbary Coast Hotels. The shuttles to the Barbary Coast are often full and don't run as often as the one to the Gold Coast so it's hard to get to the strip. Second, the machines. Staying at The Orleans, I was disappointed in the Slot Gaming. The machines appeared to be set very tightly and I never experienced any decent payoffs. The table gaming was fine. I had great slot playing at Bally's and Palace Station but they are a long way from The Orleans. The staff was relatively friendly at The Orleans. The desk clerk had a bit of a chip on her shoulder but the bellman, Chase, was awesome. He was friendly and helpful. One nice thing that The Orleans does is check room keys before allowing people on the elevator. This really keeps people without a purpose on the guestroom floors. The security staff actually comes by and chit chats. The pool at The Orleans is huge and very nice. If you are going to Vegas to hang out, very few pools can beat this one.

We had a deluxe suite (at no extra charge) until our allocated rooms were ready. The rooms we had for the rest of our stay overlooked the strip, we were on the 19th floor.

While the Orleans' bathrooms might not be made from marble and their lobby might not contain millions of dollars of blown glass - I actually prefered The Orleans, as it was comfortable, enjoyable and left money in our pockets to enjoy the rest of Vegas with. The only critical thing I would share would be the distance between the parking garage for guests and where check-in and guest elevators are located. If you overpacked, definitely invest a few tip dollars in having your luggage carried by their bellboys (if they are still called that). They are right inside the main doors. Onto the good stuff. You'll get a funbook or coupon book at check-in, one per person I think. These were great - plenty of free drinks and discounts at virtually every restaurant in the casino. We used quite a few of them. Dinner at the Prime Rib Loft, lunch at Terrible Mike's & a late night meal at the Courtyard Cafe were all excellent. The buffet was okay - we hit it at \"brunch\" and the breakfast items didn't look that great. The pizza was good though. I highly recommend Brendan's Irish Pub on Sunday's - they have a great Irish singer (John Windsor) who drank Guiness on stage and did a toast after every song. He was a riot. Our room was great - on the 10th floor overlooking the pool. The elevators up to the rooms were super quick and secure, as I was asked for my room key every single time by a security guard. Our room was clean and spacious - very comfortable bed and nice entertainment cabinet & TV. They gave you everything (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, bath gel mouthwash). Check the desk for a great lookin' postcard of the casino to send home. Maid service was stellar - they come kind of early, so just use the do not disturb tag if you don't want to be. We called househkeeping each day around 11 and asked for our room to be cleaned and they had no problem with that. The pool was nice - I especially enjoyed the hot tub or spa, as it had an island in the middle of it with a palm tree. I wish the pool was open later, but quite a few rooms faced it, so I can understand why they wouldn't want to keep it open into the wee hours of the night. We had great luck on the casino floor. I won about $60 on slots the first day, then lost a little on day 2 and won $270 on day 3 (also on slots). Overall we left up about $200. My wife played video poker mainly and broke even. When we did leave The Orleans, we had no prob catching their free shuttle. I don't think they had one directly from The Orleans to the Barbary Coast (on the strip). instead you had to catch a second shuttle at Gold Coast to Barbary Coast. But trust me - it's still a bargain compared to a cab and far less stressful than driving yourself. Just realize that The Orleans isn't walking distance from the strip. I knew this going in, so it wasn't a big deal - the $1 tip I gave the shuttle driver more than makes up for the extra $100 a night I would have been paying for a strip room. It amazed me that The Orleans was as reasonable as it was, price-wise. If you're looking for a casino that offers nice rooms, some bonus freebies and some ammenities not found in other places (we didn't use, but were amazed to learn there was a bowling alley, movie theatre and liquor store in The Orleans)....then this is your casino.

I found the lowest price on 4Vegas. The Orleans website offers a \"lowest price guarantee\"...when I booked with The Orleans, I told them about the other price. They verified it and said they would match it. Plus they give back a percentage at check-out, because they did not have the lowest price. We got the room for $55. When we checked out they gave us $9.00 back. Not bad. The hotel is very nice. The rooms were exactly as described in other reviews. Big rooms, big bathrooms, clean, an excellent deal. We checked in at 10:00 A.M and were able to go right to the room, which had an amazing STRIP VIEW (no extra charge)! The staff were very nice and helpful. The Marketplace Buffet and the (Corner?) Cafe were very good. The Casino is huge and the slots were generous. We won $200-250 several times, lower numbers many times and $1,500.00 on the morning (1:00 A.M.) that we left. The Shuttle was so helpful (no rental car). There were no problems going to or from the Strip. The Shuttle does not go to the airport. We took an airport shuttle from the airport to the hotel, but used a taxi for the trip back. As I had read in other sources-the prices are virtually the same for both. The FUN Book has some good coupons (but we did not take complete advantage of them, because we didn't look at them soon enough to really plan how to use them) Although the sign on the Gift Shop says that they close at midnite, it is actually open 24 hours. (We didn't know that initially-so if you go to your room, decide you want something-you can go down-they have a variety of things). Thanks to all who went to The Orleans before and paved the way with their good reviews. They truly helped me make the decision on where to stay and we were very happy with that decision (especially after the $1,500.00).

Our trip was \"free\" (but really was paid for in the league fees) as part of our bowling league and part of the Miller Lite / Brunwick Fun Time Tournament. We arrived Friday afternoon around 4:30pm via taxi and there wasn't a bellman anywhere so we ended up having to haul our bags to the desk and then on up to our rooms (strike one). We were assigned a room in the \"new section\" that opened last November. The room was fine for size and cleanliness. But it overlooked the main drive and we ended up hearing the traffic and noise all night long. Also, the air conditioner was so loud when it would come on that it would wake you up. The next day I went down to the front desk and stated that I was an unhappy hotel guest and would like to speak with someone who could remedy my complaints. After calmly explaining the issues and stating that I wanted a different room in a quiet location, the manager began to chide me for not having called the front desk (excuse me, but I came down here directly to solve this... I know that I want a different room and that will require new room keys so I'd have to come down anyway). So we received our new room and it was quiet with a virtually silent a/c unit. The maids were excellent in their cleaning and always pleasant to speak with; only issue is that you certainly heard them coming when they wheel down the hallways to get started in the mornings. During our four days we gambled and had the customary \"free\" drinks for players. But the bartenders and cocktail waitresses were the rudest we encountered anywhere in Vegas. We tipped $1 for each drink served when served... and still we couldn't get serviced. Even when sitting at the bar and playing on the machines right there, getting a bartender to even look your direction was nearly impossible. The bartenders and cocktail waitresses would rather talk with each other than do anything else. The bowling alley has newer equipment and a nice layout, but the people who work there are idots and they don't care at all about service. We bowled 3x while there and every experience was bad. One night our lane had something sticky on the approach so I walked up to the desk and stated that we needed \"someone to bring some cleaner and get some sticky stuff off our lane\". The guy rolls his eyes and then takes his dear sweet time to come to our lane without any cleaner. He looks at the lane and then looks at us and shrugs like \"there's nothing wrong here\" and goes to leave. We stop him and have to walk him out to the approach and physically point out all of the gunk spots. So he goes back to the desk and comes back with a metal ruler and scrapes at the gunk for a few minutes. Of course he can't get it clean with simply a ruler for scraping so he disappears again and finally comes back with a bottle of cleaner and a rag (didn't I tell him that in the first place?) and finally cleans up the stuff. It took a good 20 minutes from when I asked to when he finished. Also, on the lane next to us, an older lady (50+) went to slide and stuck and literally fell forward onto the lane in the oil and everything. Nobody working there even noticed. We had to help her up and assist her in cleaning up. Sure enough the gunk that had been on our lane was on hers too... not that the idiot who cleaned up our lane bothered to look for any more mess in the area. The only people who would really enjoy the bowling experience here are drunks, kids, and the same crowd that only bowls \"cosmic\". Restaurants... the French Market Buffet food was average buffet food (nothing great), but the servers were great. The food and service were both great at Koji. The food was okay and service was great at the Courtyard Cafe. We didn't care much for the beverages at Seattle's Best Coffee. Terrible Mike's was merely okay... the food was decent enough but we sure had to wait a long time to receive it (and there was only 3 orders ahead of us). Table gaming... the dealers were less than amiable and certainly did not provide a fun spirit for gaming. The atttitude seemed very similar to that of the bartenders and cocktail waitresses. We did visit the sister properties of the Gold Coast and the Barbary Coast (as well as other strip and downtown properties). We enjoyed the atmosphere and pleasant attitudes at the Barbary Coast, but found the Gold Coast disappointingly similar to the Orleans. The one pleasant highlight of our Orleans visit actually came from the bellman who serviced us at checkout. He was a most congenial young man who very pleasantly went about his job and just seemed to radiate happiness. At checkout we had no issues, all the financial transactions were in good order and there was adequate staffing (at noon). All in all, we won't be back to the Orleans. Even if the food/beverage and rooms pricing is a bargain by Vegas standards, the attitudes of the gaming floor staff were enough to ruin things.

I had previously read excellent reviews about it, so that is why we made the choice to stay off of the strip. When we arrived, we walked through the front doors into a smoke filled casino, we walked all the way through the casino before we realized that the front desk was at the very front. There were no signs telling us where to check in and the casino seems to go on and on into several different directions and is very confusing. Our check in was very smooth and our room was very clean and smelled very fresh. I would highly recommend this place if you like to stay in your room a lot! We spent lots of time downstairs in the casino area and I must say that the smell of smoke is with you wherever you are--shopping, eating, etc. Most of the restaurants are located right on the casino floor, and it is very difficult to get away from the smoke. I wear contacts and by the end of each night my eyes were red and watery and my clothes smelled like smoke, just to give you an example. I also read some reviews that this place is close enough to the strip to walk to. Do not be fooled! The Orleans is located more than a mile away and a walk to the strip would take you over an interstate highway and through a more industrial part of town. I even asked my shuttle driver if it was close enough to walk and he said NO WAY! We did not rent a car, and therefore depended on the shuttle to the Barbary Coast the entire time. We waited 10-30 minutes for the shuttle, which was not bad at The Orleans, but waiting on a street corner at Barbary Coast in 108 degree heat for 20 minutes can be a nightmare! I would definitely rent a car next time to have that option to drive around town and go back to the hotel when I felt like it. Overall, the Orleans is a nice place to stay--it had a nice pool area and not too crowded (although it closed at 7!), nice room, and very nice fun book with coupons to many different attractions within the hotel. The movie theatre and bowling alley are awesome, but pricey! My complaints would be no clear aisles or signs in the casino, smoky casino, too far from the strip, and slow shuttle (they should have more than one). Slots were not that loose, they were looser at Barbary Coast.

I went there on the premise that I was seeing my cousin off for her bachelorette party, but I brought my boyfriend along also so that we could get a little R&R after the familial festivities were over. We stayed at the Orleans on Sunday night. For the price that we payed, (about 75 dollars; I booked on hotwire) we got much more than we expected. The fun book they gave us was pure gold. It included free drink tickets at the Orleans, Suncoast and Goldcoast hotels, a free order of french fries and a Pepsi with the purchase of what we came to know as the BEST burger we've ever eaten and lots more. There was also a free spa admission that we never used and a free game of bowling to boot. Anyway, back to the important stuff: back to The Burger. My boyfriend and I split the double cheeseburger twice, on different days, because it was so good. There is a burger/hot dog bar there where you can design your ultimate burger. That we did. Onions, juicy red tomatoes, fresh lettuce and the crispiest little pickles....I've never had it so good at Terrible Mike's! Big Al's Oyster Bar was also a treat. I recommend the Russian Roulette- a sampling of 5 different oyster shots and a shot of chilled vodka- Belvedere, I think. My favorite oyster shot, though I detest tequila, was the Cajun shot- cocktail sauce, a little hot sauce and, well, tequila. I recommend that if you do try these shots that you don't plan on driving afterwards. Though the main ingredient is an oyster, the rest is pretty much liquor. We didn't think we'd get so sauced. Not for the weak of heart! Their bread is baked on the spot, served warm and sliced to order. I learned from the chef that day that the oysters actually ceom from a farm in Louisiana, which added to the authenticity of the whole \"Orleans\" theme. Such attention to detail! The room we stayed in was fabulous. I was pleased to find that the bathroom door opened at an angle that faced away from the bed and therefore did not shed any light on the bed. Great for an insomniac like me! I heard a little commotion on the one side of the wall, but I don't know how loud the neighbors were being so that I could hear it. The decor was kind of french, though I don't know enough to say for sure. Every piece of furniture and the wallpaper was mismatched and yet coordinated in a lovely, busy kind of way. Though some might scoff at the lack of matching objects, and some have, I knew that going in and found a way to delight in it! We arrived ahead of schedule. WAY ahead of schedule. Actual check in time was somewhere closer to 3pm but they allowed us to check in at 10 am instead.

As if that wasn't good enough, they gave us \"fun books\" as we checked in that had coupons for free drinks, buy one, get one free bowling, all sorts of other discounts. What a deal! The rooms were clean and spacious. This is not a five star hotel, but it was very nice. Everyone who worked there was friendly, as were the other guests we met. We enjoyed the pool. It's large and has a separate kids pool and a large hot tub/pool. The bowling alley was great fun. A nice escape from the usual Vegas stuff. We don't really gamble, but everyone seemed to be enjoying the casino. The only down side for some people is that is is a distance from the Strip (although that has an up side as well -- it's calmer as a result.) We had a car so it didn't matter to us. Also, if you get tired of the buffet there is a great Irish pub across the street called McMullans. The food was reasonable, very good, and we had wonderful service.

Got there about an hour before official check-in time and got our room, no problem. Only 2 people ahead of us in line, took about 5 minutes. Took a couple of minutes of checking the hotel map to get oriented, but once we did, never had a problem finding our way around. There is a security guard stationed at the elevators at all times & you have to show your room key. My husband had forgotten his in the room one evening & I had to come down from the room with it so they would let him up! So, very impressed with security. Room was great... lots of room. We had 2 queen beds, a hutch with TV & drawers, a small desk & chair & near the window a small sofa & chair & coffee table. Loved the opening window in the bathroom. Fresh air! And the gold colored faucets & other accents were a nice touch. I liked the place to hang clothes in the bathroom. Lots of room. And there's an iron & ironing board & hairdryer. Was very quiet. The AC unit was comparable to other hotels I have stayed in... its normal for it to be a little noisy... but that can be a good thing as it will mask any traffic noise from the hallway. But there was none in our case... we were 4 doors down from the elevators & it was not noisy at all! Asked for extra pillows & towels & got them within 5 minutes. Couldn't access the \"menu\" on the TV, they sent someone & again they arrived within 5 minutes & had it fixed. Beds were comfy, although it was a smoking room, it didn't smell smoky (and I'm a non-smoker, so I notice smoke smell!). Loved the casino... nice mix of table games & mixed denomination slots. And it was roomy... lots of room in the aisles, so you are not squeezing between seated slot players to get through. And again, not smoky at all! The bowling alley was nice, but not in the best shape. Needs some renovations. But there were a lot of people there bowling at 1am on a Thursday! Saw 1 movie at the theatre, had the place to ourselves! Very comfy seats! Arcade was fun for my son... he ended up with a couple of prizes from redeeming tickets he had won on the games. He also used the Kid's Tyme Center & LOVED it. He was begging us to let him go back! The staff there were great with the kids and there was lots to keep them busy! And again, very secure, no one can just wander in there. Loved the 75 cent hotdogs near the sportsbook area for lunch! Didn't like Terrible Mikes too much, but good prices. Had an ice cream at Kates Corner, which was nice. Buffet was great. Had breakfast at the Courtyard Cafe one morning, food was cold. That was my only complaint about our whole stay there! Used the shuttle to go to the strip... very convenient & hardly any wait going either way. Walked to the Walgreens from the hotel which is about 2 blocks away. A little bit of a hike, but not too bad. Liked the gift shop in the hotel. Bought a couple of souvenirs... good prices. Check out was quick & easy, everything was in order. I will definitely be staying here again, might be going back in late summer. Staff was really friendly. Came out ahead from the slots.

I must say that I was presently surprised. When we got there we were there two hours prior to check in but the front desk was very friendly and got us in after a call to housekeeping. Our King room was a little \"old\" in its decoration but was in good repair and was larger than a normal hotel room. Most importantly our room was very clean and our housekeeper was wonderful. My Father and Mother in law got a much newer room which looked to be very recently restored. The Casino is a little cheesy, but great for the novice gambler like myself. I enjoyed the blackjack tables and the friendly vibe I got from playing there which I never experienced anywhere on the strip. I also found that it was easier to get comps and cocktail waitresses were much more attentive here. The restauraunts were all OK and adequate. I would highly recommend the japanese restaurant there, the food is excellent. I also liked the coffee shop, kind of a Starbucks knockoff and just as good. The pool is not a typical Vegas pool that is very flashy, but it is nice and spread out enough that it never feels crowded. Towels at the pool are always in abundance and they have a great little bar there that never seems to get real busy. There is also a nice bowling alley upstairs. We did not use the shuttle to the strip while I was there, but I did see it quite often. The hardest workers in the hotel is the Valet staff. Valet parking is free here and well worth it. We never waited more than 5 minutes for our rental car the whole time we were there.

My son was hungry so we went to the late night cafe. No specials since it was Friday night. Service was pretty slow and food was so-so. I was hungry and super tired so I did not care much. The room was clean but a little threadbare. Beds and pillows were comfy. Could not hear neighbors like some have had problems with. Maid service was not really that good. They knocked even though I had the 'do not disturb' sign on every morning. Specifically left a tip each morning, but the room was not really straightened up. My son's 'blankie' was left in the middle of the floor when it had been in his bed. Did a whole lot of room service there. Could not deal with hiking thru the casino with my son all that much. Yes, I know Vegas is not for kids, but he did have a wedding to attend. Room service was reasonable, food was plentiful and still at the proper temp. If there was a problem it was fixed promptly. Also brought food up from Terrible Mike's on night. Chicken nuggets were huge and there were lots of them. They say they do not offer to-go containers, but the nice lady at the pick up counter covered it all in plastic wrap for me. Had some pool time solo and the next day with my son. Lots of fun at the pool bar. Used the free drink coupons that we got. Love a pina coloda in the sun with a good book. The pool area was nice, lots of towels if you need them, floats and water noodles to rent (or are just left around later in the day to use). The kiddie pool was great. Round and goes from about 1 ft to about 3 ft. I could sit at the side and not have to be in the water with my son. Biggest problem with the pool was the hours. 10 am to 6 pm is just not really good if you have kids. We are up at 7 am could have used it earlier and even later before bathtime. Another heads up for those of you that travel with kids. There are no 'kids' channels. Not a Disney Channel, a Nickelodeon or a Cartoon Network type channel to be had. We ended up renting a movie on pay-per-view. Kind of pricey, but necessary. At least there were lots of pay choices. The gift shop was pretty great. Snacks, water and drinks all at reasonable prices. $1.59 for a liter of soda. Heck, who needs to walk all the way to a convenience store. And nice prices on singles of beer, wine or little mixed drinks. Check out was pretty smooth. They were even nice enough to refund me my money that was lost in the soda machines on the weekend. All in all...it is a 3 star hotel. No more and barely that. If you can get the $25 pricing and you are on a budget. Go for it. The strip is not far at all.

All staff very friendly. Had couples massage at the spa and that was excellent. Only ate breakfast buffet there and it was so good we ate there every morning. We usually bop around trying different ones in the other hotels, but this was well worth the price. Gambling wise it is video poker heaven. I would say 70% of their machines are video poker which my wife and I really enjoy playing. Stayed in the newer wing of the hotel and the room was clean and spacious and the maid service was perfection. Oh and a large bottle of water cost $1.67. If you've ever stayed at the above mentioned places then you know the same bottle can be $3 to $4.

There were about 6 or 7 clerks at the desk when we checked in and out and back again on the 8th and I was helped by the same unfriendly but not rude young lady each time. We requested one room with a king and one room with two queens and a crib on an upper floor next to or across from each other (non smoking). Well our room was on the 16th floor and my mother-in-law's room was on the 6th floor sans the king bed. We were told that we could request a change later in the morning, but my mother-in-law decided to stay put :). We did get rooms on the 12th floor next to each other when we checked back in on the 8th. We learned that if you park in the parking deck you can get to the elevators without walking through the smoky casino to get to your room. Showing your room card to the security guard to get on the elevator was reassuring. I've read here over and over again that the rooms are large and clean. Well, they are LARGE and CLEAN. Our bed linings and shower curtains were obviously brand new because the fold creases were clearly visible. We were very pleased with our rooms. The bath rooms were very large, which is were we stowed our luggage. Because we were too busy going to places like the Fiesta Henderson for their awesome $1.49 breakfast and the truckstop like Wild Wild West for their $2.69 half pound hamburger or $4.99 buffalo burger, we only had one meal at the Orleans buffet $12.99 dinner, there were lots of variety, my favorite was the fried oysters. There's also a hotdog stand in the casino were you can get hotdogs for .75. We didn't get a chance to use the bowling alley or the movie theater although we had free tickets to preview the movie Sahara. Our kids loved the resort like pool and hot tub area.

Sadly, that is just what was waiting for us at the Orleans. When we arrived at the hotel to check in we were told that all that was left were smoking rooms. We explained to the clerk that we had booked a no smoking room clear back in January and had already paid for the room. She said that they can't guarentee the room you get. I must, however say that we did get in to Vegas late because our flight had been delayed. We arrived at about 11:00pm. The clerk was very rude to us and plainly did not care about our problem. We were given a choice to either take a smoking room or not have a room. I asked if it would be possible to get a no smoking room that next day. The clerk said she would put in a request for it and asked if we still wanted the room. Needless to say that at 11:00 at night we did not have to much of a choice. We spent a very sleepless night in the smoking room. The next morning we went down to have breakfast and check on the status of our already paid for room that we did not get. To make a long story short we were told to keep checking back three times . We got the room but wasted a whole day. We got the room at 3:00pm. We found the service bad and will not stay at the Orleans again. We contacted the Coast Casinos and didn't any answer back from them for two weeks.

Use the coupon in the book for a free day at the spa! Casino: Join the comps program! They have 3 different systems for table/slots/poker room. Slots and Table play add points together and with the very loose slots (at least on the video poker machines) it comps you on your wins per hand played! Poker room pays a monetary amount but I'm not sure of all the details. I only played a total of 6 hours in the poker room. I must say that this casino is very nicely set up. They have bunches and bunches of video poker machines everywhere and many of them progressives! They also have regular slots as well as video slots. What I really liked was the spacing between the rows/groups of machines. I never was ever bumped or run into or ever felt clausterphobic while playing slots. The cocktail waitresses were very timely with drinks and refills. Their table games were always populated. And they had more lower limit tables than higher limit tables, but their min/max limits seemed to be very friendly. The poker room was HUGE! Wonderful floor staff for reservations for the different type of limits as well as a tournament always happening. check the schedule, I didn't get up in time to enter their morning tournament $100 buyin and 1 rebuy, but on a Sunday they got close to 200+ players. YES LOTS OF LOCALS, so be prepared to be playing your best game of Hold 'Em. LOCALS are very nice. They are friendly and explain new things to the visitors and give good advice to novices about how to play and even where to go eat! I felt very at home playing poker there. Next time I'll play in the tournament. You know, I feel a lot more confident in my poker play after playing with those veteran wise men. I got spanked on some very notable strong hands at a 4/8 table. Capped on pocket aces only to be beat on the river by a set of Q's; set of Qs to be beat by river set of Ks. THE ONLY COMPLAINT: The table game dealers seemed fresh out of dealing school...this is both on poker and casino table games. What I ended up finding out was there was a mass exodus of dealers because the MGM is opening up a new poker room this coming Monday as well as the new Wynn is opening up a totally new casino (HEH). The locals said this was to be expected with new openings. So hopefully when I return in May, the new dealers will have had some good experience! I did look into the Sport Books area and the sense I got from it was that it was big and less crowded than the other strip casinos. They had MORE plasma TV's than any of the other strip casinos (Mirage has terrible video displays). The sitting area in the Sport Books area were tailored to people wanting to sit at a desk and not lounge in a comfy chair. I must say, it wasn't as crazy as the Mirage was during the NCAA tournament games. 5 of 5 Conclusion: If you don't like crowds or don't care for walking up and down the strip, this place is for you. If you know what you want to do in Vegas and don't care if you are not on the strip, this place is perfect for you. If you have children, The Orleans has lots of things for them to do! The Orleans has everything a Strip hotel would have, just not at the price of some Strip hotels or located on the Strip! But that's ok...take a shuttle or rent a car or pay for a cab! The Orleans is really one of those Most Bang for your Buck places! ONE LAST THING! The layout of the hotel is massive and you will be walking A LOT if you don't ask about the short cut through the grassy area in the middle of their property! Man...it will save you time and wear and tear on your feet! ASK THE SECURITY PEOPLE! 4 out of 5, only because you can pay a lot more for luxury, and sometimes you want that!", "Date": "March 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cOK\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3296611", "Content": "Room is spacious Price is very competitive (not great but good for the room size) Asked for non-smoking while reserving and check in, but when I went to the room, it was a smoking room.

The front desk was very accomodating when we requested that all 3 rooms be on the same floor even though the other 2 parties were not going to check in until later that evening. The only problem was that one of the rooms they had reserved for us obviously had some type of water damage because the door was still propped open with a towel and there were two blowers going to try and dry out the carpet. The room also had a very musty smell. They ended up putting our third party on a separate floor. Otherwise the rooms were very clean. My only complaint about the amenities is that the iron is bolted to one end of the ironing board so it is difficult to use. The valet was very prompt and courteous. The chinese food at the 24 hour cafe was delicious and of course the buffet was great...especially the price. The only major problem I saw with this hotel was the number of unattended kids that were running around. I have stayed in several other hotels in Vegas and they have strict policies that the kids must stay on the main pathway & not hang around the games. Unfortunately that was not the case at The Orleans. Kids were seen unsupervised hanging around the slots and game tables not to mention the ones that ran up and down the halls on a nightly basis. Two of us had families staying in the rooms next to us and you could tell when the parents left the kids alone in the room because of all the noise.

I got an internet deal for $20 per night. Well let me just say \"What a deal!\" Everything you have read about this hotel is true. The rooms are very large. Nice sized bathrooms and a nice sitting area with a love seat and armchair. I have noticed on this website that some people have complained about the mattresses. I will agree that the mattress is not really a mattress per se. It is more of a three/four inch thick foam covering over a box spring. Very strange. However, it did not bother me as I had feared it might. I will say that if you are someone who is particular about their mattress, you might have problems with their \"bedding.\" Also, after you get to your room, you might want to call Housekeeping and have some extra pillows delivered as their pillows are not very thick. Speaking of Housekeeping, anytime I needed anything at all such as extra pillows, towels, etc., they were always very quick to arrive. Within five minutes. Also, the room was cleaned thoroughly everyday. In a city where one hotel can have 2000-3000 rooms, I know from previous experiences in Las Vegas that housekeeping can be very spotty, but they kept my room immaculate. Kudos to the Housekeeping Department. As for the casino itself, I did not find it to be smokey at all, as compared to other casinos. The casino is a nice size and very easy to maneuver through. I did not use the self-parking. In fact, I did have a rental car and found the valet parking to be most convenient. In fact, if you valet park, you have a very short walk (as compared to most other mega-casinos) to the guest room elevators. I did not eat in any of the restaurants at the hotel, so I cannot comment on them. The cocktail waitresses, however, were very attentive whether you were playing a penny slot machine or a five dollar slot machine. Also, the front desk staff were very friendly and check-in was very quick. As for the gambling, I did O.K. here. Won some and lost some. However, I hate their slot club. You only receive points for winning not for how much money you put into the machine. So needless to say, I did not spend a lot of money on the slots here. Hopefully they will address this issue, but don't count on it. As you have probably read in previous reviews, the hotel is not located near the strip. One to two miles away. They do have a free shuttle to the Strip, but I did not use it as I had a rental car. I have been to Las Vegas before and had never rented a car until this stay. Let me just say this, if you will be staying off of the strip or even in downtown, it is well worth it to rent a car. I had no trouble with the traffic and found having the car allowed me the freedom to explore other aspects of Las Vegas other than the strip. I was able to rent a mid-size car from Dollar for $17 a day. Think of it this way, if you take a taxi twice in one day, you will spend more on the taxi, depending on where you go, than what it would cost to rent the car for the day. Also, when you rent a car, just use the valet parking at the hotels. It's free, save for the one to two dollar tip when you retrieve your car. Of course, if you are only going to be staying on the Strip or just in downtown, then it would not be cost effective to rent a car unless you plan to do some sightseeing. So I guess the final analysis is this, would I stay at the Orleans Hotel again? You bet. Even if I had to pay 80-90 dollars per night, it is well worth it.

One lady won $1,000 right in front of us. We probably won about $50 or so and got to spin the wheel a lot! Great drinks service, and I didn't find it that smoky. The smokiest casino we encountered was the MGM (stayed there last visit for $160/night, ouch). The MGM is a great casino, full of excitement, but has high-limit tables and lots of smoke. Anyway, back to the Orleans.... The food was OK. Ate at Terrible Mike's a couple of times for convenience sake....they had good burgers and fries. Ate at the buffet for breakfast....it was OK, you get what you pay for at $5.99/pop. Eat at the Bellagio for breakfast; we did one morning and it was wonderful for $13.99/person. The shuttle was OK. It only runs 9:30 am to midnight, which is a disadvantage to early birds and night owls, so we took a cab about 1/2 the time ($10 with tip to/from strip, $14 with tip to/from airport). It does drop you off in a great spot right across from the Bellagio. Overall we loved the Orleans and would stay there again. It caters mostly to families and older people (we are in our 20s and 30s), so if you're the party type, you probably won't like it, but personally we loved the laid-back feel, the quiet rooms, and the great prices!

Our first surprise was arriving in Las Vegas to find that it was 60 degrees with threats of snow flurries. Who says that Vegas is warm year round? After a 10 minutes/$20 taxi ride from the airport we were surprised to size the size and glamor of the Orleans as we arrived at the hotel. Check in-in was fast and friendly. Of course we needed to navigate through part of the casino to get to the room. We requested a standard room with a king bed and were assigned to the 21st floor. We were surprised at the size and comfort of the Jr. suite we were assigned. We later discovered that all rooms are over-sized, Jr. suites. The room was very clean and nicely decorated with a view of the city and the mountains in the distance. (I found out that the mountains were 30 minutes from the strip and had several ski resorts that just opened for the season). We were mazed at the quiet in the hallways. I was glad to see that high-speed Internet access was available for $9.95 per 24 hours. We took a quick tour of the hotel and found a a number of restaurants, a spa, bowling alley, movie theater and sports arena in addition to the casino. During our two day stay we ate at Big Alls Oyster Bar, Sazio, The Prime Rib Loft and the Courtyard Caf\u00e9 and found the food to be very good and reasonably priced. We played the slots and found them to be generous. The cocktail waitress seemed to be around every 10 minutes. Although the Orleans is only a few miles from the strip it's a bit too far to walk. A shuttle is provided but seems to run very infrequently. We choose to use a taxi which cost $10 with tip. I suggest you help support the taxi drivers instead of waiting for the shuttle. Overall we were very pleased with the Orleans and will be back. We will recommend to our friends as the best value in Las Vegas.

The Big Al's Oyster restaraunt was very disappointing...I was expecting great Cajun food and it tasted more like bad Chinese. Vey icky. The Mexican restaurant was great! Loved the salsa! The breakfasts were good at the Cafe and the buffet. Very yummy and reasonable. I did have a few issues with the staff initialing not being very helpful during the planning stages of our wedding, but once we got there it was fine. The bartenders are VERY slow at all the casino bars, so order two right away!! The drinks were also very week. We also found that if you need to use an ATM, there is a ATM machine a 1/2 block away that only charges 2 dollars; the casino-hotel ones cost from $9-$35, PLUS a percentage of what you take out. Big rip off! The Rite Aid on Rainbow also has disposable cameras for $9 versus $20 every where else we went(mini marts, etc..). The coupon book they give you on check in is very nice and we used that a lot. Don't plan on bringing any children near you or the casino.

They CAN'T. They can in the bowling alley and the kiddie area. That's it. A shuttle will take you to the Suncoast and Barbary Coast casinos for free. They leave every 20 minutes.

I must, however, be honest about the cons. The pool really is only open from noon until 5pm. And yes, this includes the hot tub. What a shame. It was almost 70 degrees and sunny the whole time we were there, but the hotel blocks the sun from the pool area and makes it feel like 50. I went down at noon one day and there wasn't a soul around...I don't blame them. The hotel reservation system only allows you to \"request\" a type of room, and they state loud and clear once you arrive that room types are just that...not a guarantee. Thank god it wasn't busy because our smoking king room with a view turned into a nonsmoking double room without. We ended up having to cart our luggage all the way back down to front desk and wait in line again to get a new room. They actually have it programmed into their answering service to select \"2\" if you'd like to request a room change. Must be a common occurance. If you're not picky and don't mind the average service and food you'll be okay. But if you're looking for a better experience there are other places to try. We stayed at the Golden Nugget in January and trust me...the four star rating really does make a difference, and the price is almost the same. In all fairness to the Orleans I will conclude that it is a great deal but you really do get what you pay for. That and the waitresses wear basically nothing. Literally.

Clean rooms and nice bed. Nothing extravagant. The fun book would have been more helpful if we had stayed longer, we could have used more coupons. The 30 minute wait for the shuttle over to the strip was nice. It helped since parking was at a premium as we found out on the second day we visited the strip. The slots that my wife played were extremely loose. She probably won $200 during the 2 days we were there and the blackjack was giving as well as I too won around $150. The buffet was not much to talk about. No better or worse than any other buffet in any other city. Finally, check-out was just as easy.

The rooms are large, a little bit worn, but very clean. I had no complaints with the rooms. We enjoyed all of the meals we had at the hotel, especially the breakfast buffet! It was also convenient having a theater and bowling ally. We did not find staying off the strip to be much of a problem. We had rented a car, so we would just drive down one of the side roads going to the strip and park. A lot of my friends said it was a better to stay on the strip, but I think getting around would be even worse without a car. We found transportation on the strip inconvenient. The monorail did not work and we never could find a trolly. Bus lines were long. We tried the hotel bus once, but found out you spend a lot of time waiting. Now the downside of the Orleans. For us the biggest issue was the smoke in the casino. It was absolutely horrible and we found our hotel to be worse than others. Other places seem to have better ventilation. Also, we were really disappointed that the pool closed at 5:00p.m. each day. We really wanted to enjoy the hot tub. On the last night we discovered that the spa has an indoor jacuzzi and you can use you coupon for one visit. The only thing was my husband and I could not go together because it had separate facilities. The spa is really nice and I wished I had used it more.

Upon arrival at The Orleans, tried the 20$ trick at check in, but she apologized saying that they were swamped during the time we were there, and that the best she could do was upgrade us to a suite but we'd have to pay (like 200$ or something) which we declined. I still offered to give her the money, but she smiled and passed it back to me saying she wouldn't feel right taking it since she couldn't do anything for us. They give you a coupon book and we got our little casino comp cards- the coupon book was pretty cool! You got free drinks in their bars, and % off things you buy in their gift shop. Plus, during the week, the casino was handing out free buffet coupons for the French Market Buffet. Nickel slots were pretty loose- we didn't WIN alot, but we were able to play for looooong periods of time. Saw quite a few people winning some big jackpots, especially on Monday night, which was fun. We enjoyed the nickel slots- as a newly married couple we could find 2 slots and sit next to each other, having a drink and playing for hours at a time on 20$ each. Not a bad form of entertainment. :) Played a little BJ, but I didn't have a good table- and I didn't enjoy either one of the dealers we had. However, my 20$ lasted for 2 hours playing BJ and when I left the table, I still had 10$ so I did okay. Waitresses comping you cocktails while you were playing were very attentive and friendly. Ate at the Courtyard Cafe at the Orleans which was pretty good. Seafood Buffet on Monday night at the French Market Buffet was actually a heckuva lot better! Plus, we had gotten comped for free so that made it even tastier! That night, we also used our coupon-book to get a FREE bottle of wine. We went to the strip for one whole day, and I took 100$ spending money with us. We ate at the Aladdin's Spice Market Buffet- now THAT was really good.

I took my third trip to Vegas for a birthday celebration with my mom & sister. It was their first trip, and we celebrated my mom's 50th, my sister's 25th, and my 29th. We surprised our mom with the tickets and had a fantastic time! Since I got some useful info from the forums here, I thought I'd add my own two cents and hopefully help someone else out. First, we stayed at the Orleans. After reading multiple positive reviews and not being too concerned with staying off strip, I thought it was a great bargain. Since I found an internet rate lower than the rate I was quoted by the Orleans, they matched the lower rate minus an additional 5% (it pays to research!). The room was great! We had a nice view of the hotel pool, and the room elevators were not miles away from the casino entrance. There was a sitting area, a desk and comfortable beds. Also, security checks your hotel key card before they allow you into the elevators, so that did allow for a little extra peace of mind. There was some construction at the opposite end of our floor, but we were never bothered by it. The maid service was reliable and at our request, provided extra free postcards. The coupon book they give you is really good - lots of free perks/upgrades, etc. I would say that the only issue we had with the hotel at all was related to the shuttle. We regularly used the free shuttle from the Orleans to the Barbary Coast (on the strip) and back again. We didn't have trouble with the wait, although sometimes there was a lot of traffic and the shuttle was delayed longer than usual, but it would be the same with a rental car or cab. Our problem was that when people lined up for the shuttle, they would line up at both ends, making a true line impossible. Plus, when the shuttle pulled up to let people off and pick more up, whoever happened to be closest to the doors got on, regardless of who was waiting longest. We got lucky in that we always managed to get onto the shuttle, but I would have been very upset if there wasn't room for the three of us but others who had waited less time got on without a problem. I think this could be solved with a posted sign saying \"shuttle line begins here\", and making the shuttle pull as close as possible to the front of the line every time. I did write this suggestion on the hotel card. Otherwise, no problems at all with the hotel, and I would definitely stay here again. Next time, I'll try to take advantage of the spa options and check out the pool area! We did see the Cirque du Soleil show \"O\" at the Bellagio (my favorite hotel), and it was fantastic! If you've never seen one of their shows before, there's really no way to explain it other than a weird, somewhat psychedelic dream sensation, but as always, it's extremely visual. \"O\" was all about water and the stage was amazing. We purchased the 'cheapest' (still expensive!) tickets and were seated in what the theatre considers a limited view section. This was because there was a railing within our sight, but it was easy to ignore, in my opinion, and it certainly did not keep us from enjoying the show. Plus, being a bit higher up allowed us to really see formations in the water that we might have missed being down low. My favorite part was the section with all the crazy diving....wow! We managed to go to quite a few hotels to see the sights - Siren Battle @ TI, Volcano & white tigers @ Mirage, rainstorm @ Aladdin, fountains @ Bellagio (our favorite!), watched the lions & got our pictures taken with 5 week old lion cubs @ MGM (!!), all three of us rode the Big Shot @ Stratosphere (my 2nd time), saw Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Excalibur, Tropicana, NYNY, Ceasars Palace, Bellagio, Paris, Hard Rock (got to unexpectedly see Blink 182 unveil their display of instruments and get their autographs, wow!), looked inside the Hofbrau House/Beer Garden, went to Freemont St & saw the light show as well as a free concert by Eddie Money (mom wanted to see him!)......too much to name! Although the monorail wasn't working (bummer), we manged to drag ourselves all over the place. Definitely wear good shoes! As far as eating is concerned, my favorite breakfast buffet is Le Village Buffet @ Paris. The food is so fantastic that I actually dream about it! Fresh crepes, tons of fruit, good service, delicious cheeses...Yum! You MUST get here early on weekends especially if you expect to eat breakfast. Lunch starts at 11am and if you are not in line by 930, you might be out of luck. We also had a very nice late lunch at Olives @ the Bellagio. You can sit outside and watch the fountains or sit inside in a cozy atmosphere. Service was of course excellent and you definitely feel pampered. Since we are not huge gamblers, we did splurge more on dining and shopping, which was fine by us. To wrap up, go see Vegas and try to see & do as much as you can. There is no place in the world like it. My mom & sister are now hooked and we may make a multi-birthday trip a yearly event. Definitely take advantage of coupon books & magazines in the cabs or your hotel room. Hard Rock had a free $5 play if you sign up for their players card, which is neat by itself since it prints your name on it and makes a good souvenir. We wimped out and played slots instead of upping a blackjack bet, but we each ended up making about $10, which was free money, which we used to buy a Starbucks coffee there since they had a coupon for a larger size drink upgrade! So, free huge coffee, free shuttle ride from the strip to the Hard Rock, free five bucks, free souvenir from the gift shop, and to top it off, we lucked out and got free Blink 182 autographs! Woo-hoo! Use those coupons! Enjoy your trip, and feel free to ask questions - I feel like a Vegas diva!

My husband and I stayed from Sept. 30 - Oct. 3, 2004. We chose the hotel because of the good reviews from this site. The hotel has great curb appeal, however when you walk in the Casino the impression is lost due to the horrible smoke smell. The hotel should invest in a better filtration system like some of the hotels on the Strip. We are non-smokers so it may have bothered us more than someone who is a smoker.

Everytime we came back from the strip our room had already been cleaned. We never had to call down to the front desk to request anything for our room. Plenty of towels, soap etc. was provided. The shuttle service was very disorganized. At The Orleans and Barbary Coast there was no seating provided nor was there anywhere for people to form a line. This caused a mad rush to board the shuttle when it did arrive leaving those who had already been waiting 30 min. to wait additional time to catch another shuttle because individuals who just walked up would hop on the shuttle first. It was very tiring fighting for a seat just to get back and fourth. The shuttles did not always stay on schedule and several times the shuttle drivers pulled up, cut the shuttle off and went into the Casino for a break.

We take a trip to Las Vegas every year, and with few exceptions, almost always stay at the Rio. We love the Rio, but at the time that we were making reservations, the rates quoted were sky high. Since we always rent a car, staying at the Orleans was not a concern. We were hesitant to book our entire stay at the Orleans because the price just seemed too good to be true, so we reserved at Mandalay Bay for the second half of our stay. We were thrilled with the Orleans, and if it wasn't for the fact that our Mandalay Bay stay was prepaid, we would have spent our whole time there. The rooms were great. Housekeeping was right on. Although we didn't win big in the casino, we didn't lose much either. We enjoyed the $5 black jack tables. We felt less intimidated in this casino than in some of the fancier places. Once we moved to Mandalay Bay, we found ourselves returning to play at the Orleans. Loved Terrible Mike's. The buffet was pretty good as well. Prime Rib Loft is ok but nothing to write home about. We enjoyed the pool area being less hectic, quieter, more relaxed than Mandalay Bay. Also loved the SHORT walk to the pool, and the fact that you didn't have to walk through the casino to get there. Maybe we're in the minority, but we also liked the fact that you could find some shade and didn't need to bake in the heat if that is a problem for you.

We have been traveling to Vegas the past 10 years and have typically stayed on the Strip; usually The Mirage (our fav!), Monte Carlo, MGM or Treasure Island. For those on a budget, and looking to vacation in Vegas longer than a few days, The Orleans is a true gem! We stayed 6 evenings and paid a total of $350. It would have cost us at least 4x times that on the Strip - we were on a tight budget this year. For those 5-star hotel snobs out there, this will not be the place for you. However, for those of us who come to Vegas and need a room to \"sleep and shower\" in, you must check out The Orleans! Here are my overall thoughts: Check-in/Maid Service - TERRIFIC! Room was always clean by 9am. Casino - large, but personable. Won $3k playing BJ the very first day! Pool - the other reviewer was WRONG! The sun does shine at the pool, however, it usually hits the pool around 10:30. This was GREAT because as those of us Strip visitors know, you have to get in line almost a 1/2hr before most pools open to get a decent seat and, if you happen to hit the pool late, you NEVER find a seat. The pool is not as spectacular as the Mirage or Monte Carlo, BUT I was always able to find a chair without having to trip over everyone to get it. Hmmmm, for the previous review, I laid out everyday for six days came home VERY tan! I guess I wrote a lot here because the pool is a very important part of our hotel decision! Rooms: Very spacious and well appointed. Again, you are not going to get the marble floors and big fluffy bath towels or AVEDA skin products, but what you do get is a huge and very clean bathroom with an area large enough to hang all your clothes! Remember, the room, on average, is $70/night, not $250 like the Bellagio! Restaurants: Ok, here is where you might want to go elsewhere. The restaurants are just mediocore - the only downside to staying at The Orleans. I suggest visiting some of the restaurants at Bellagio or Mirage, i.e. Prime, Kokomos, etc. One positive about The Prime Rib Loft here; the prime rib is terrific and the martini's were only $2.95 - no joke and they were great! Spa - FANTASTIC! The services are moderatly priced and absolutely incredible -- you must ask for Craig - he's awesome!!! Oh yea, only $10 to use gym (free w/ spa treatment)...not $25-30 like other Strip hotels. The entire Spa is less than 2 years old and is beautiful! Sorry for the long review, but I have been waiting months to write it! Very glad I am able to write a positive one :) Again, if you are on a budget, or you just want to try a nice modern resort off the Strip, you must try this place! Have fun! PS - TIP:use the coupon books provided at check-in. Lot's of useful coupons. There are at least 4 free drink coupons - which can be used at the pool!

I was disappointed that there was not any complimentary coffee and that you had to pay to use the fitness room. They did give you a coupon book for 1 free visit to the fitness room. We went to the buffet and all of us were alittle disappointed, it looked appealing but was average at best. The smoke in the casino & main hotel was bad and this was mid week and not even crowded, the hotel could use a better filtering system.

We stayed Aug 4-8th and since we'd always stayed on the strip, we tried something new. We really liked the off strip location, the new pool improvements, and the casino was not all that busy or smoky except for Saturday night when it was really crowded. We rented a car and parking in the Orleans garage was an easy walk, every day we'd drive to the MGM and took the monorail everywhere-it was a breeze! The check-in was fast, the maid service good (we tipped $2 a day and got extra towels and more shampoo than we ever needed) The big bathroom was very nice to have and the room being oversized was appreciated. The remodeling caused a few hours on one day of elevator waiting/crowding due to three of them being closed for but other than that, it was no hassle for us on the 19th floor. We drove out to the Red Rock Canyon one morning- took the 13 mile drive, which was well worth the trip to see. We also took in the Mac King Comedy Magic Show at Harrah's-the best daytime entertainment at a cheap price. Great for young and old alike. We also took in V the Variety show at the Aladdin- it's sad to see the variety shows heading out- this one was very good but in such a small venue, we felt very crowded. If you want a romantic meal with a view, try the Eiffel Tower at Paris right at sundown- we had a view of the Bellagio fountains (you may have to wait for a window table but it is worth it) We also took a helicopter tour of the strip using the Las Vegas helicopter booth located right across the Aladdin- for $79 a person,I thought it was pricey- it went really fast, and did not cover the south end of the strip, so I'd reccommend using one of the other services that do cover that end for more value-but since we were back walking the strip in 20 minutes it was best for us. Super smooth ride and the pilot gives a good speech/tour. Great buffet at the Spice Market Buffet at Aladdin-good selection, if somewhat overpriced.

The buffet at the Rio is a must, but be prepared to wait in line (it's worth it). La Cage is one the the best shows we've seen. Stay away from the Excalibur King of Tournaments show. The food is barely adequate and the service we experienced was the worst we've ever received. Plus the gratuity is included so you have no recourse. Excalibur needs to take a lesson from Florida's Dixie Stampede, Medieval Times, and Arabian Nights. Here's a tip, unless there is a show that you have to see wait and get your tickets when you get there. Tix4 Tonight offers 1/2 price tickets for shows that night.

The hotel is BIG and has looooooong corridors like all other big hotels I visited in Las Vegas. The reception staff was very friendly, fast, efficient and helpful. No complaints at all. No waiting in line more than 1 minute. The location is little bit far from the Strip but if you have a rented car it's not a problem. You can park freely your car at Bellagio or Alladin in the middle of the Strip and walk around all the night. The French Farm Market restaurant in the hotel is very large, clean and cheap: $5.75 for breakfast buffet $6.75 for lunch and dinner buffet and the food is excellent and has all the choices including american, seafood, chinese, italian, mexican etc. But not much choices if you want to eat after midnight as only 2 small fastfood restaurants are open 24hrs. You have an Internet choice in every room but it's not friendly and is expensive. While the reception staff was very friendly, I can't say it about the bussiness center clerk. The Internet prices there were outreageous at $1 per minute with at least $15 payement !! The Casino was less fancy than others from the Strip and is less populated. No problem with smoke or noise from Casino. I was mainly interested in seeing shows and did it. I suggest you to go a day before or in the morning at the Box Office of every hotel hosting the show. The so-called 50% off tickets booth on the Strip offers good prices for less interesting shows. But for Cirque de Soleil at Bellaggio, Celine Dion at Caesar's Palace or Mamma Mia at Mandalay resort, go straight to the hotel box office.

The buffet was pretty good, they have a 10+ screen movie theatre on the second floor of the casino. Only two things I was unimpressed with, first was that the slots there didn't pay out as well as the ones on the strip, and you had to walk what felt like at least a mile to get from the room tower to the casino floor, and another mile to the parking area to get to your car if you rented one.

We had made a reservation for a room with a king size bed several months ahead of our arrival. We were given a room with two regular beds. After going to the front desk, we were told that we could get a king size bed the next day (Sunday). The Front Desk told us that people who had made their reservations several months in advance had gotten all the king size bedrooms....we had also made reservations in advance. Our blind daughter accidently dropped her cane down the elevator shaft while getting off the elevator. We immediately went to the Front Desk to ask for someone to retrieve the cane...since this was her independence. Only the clerk that night seemed interested in getting her cane back. But maintainence told her that it was not possible because the Otis Elevator Co would have to come out and retrieve the cane. They promised to place a call on Sunday A.M. to Otis. When we returned late Sunday night after a trip to the Grand Canyon, we spoke to Jeff at the Desk....a front desk manager. He stated he had placed two calls to Otis and that they had never returned his call..but they would try again on Monday AM. We asked if he thought if we placed a call to Otis to explain the urgency of a blind person getting her cane back if they would move faster. He said he did not think so. When my husband returned to the room, he found the number for Otis Elevator and called it. Since it was late Sunday P.M. he got the national answering service for Otis. The gentleman from Otis told my husband that he did not have a record of The Orleans calling for assistance over the weekend and that he would have it IF they had called. Jeff lied to us when he said he had called. The man from Otis told my husband that when he hung up that he was going to call The Orleans. Monday morning, the Otis Elevator Co. retrieved my daughters cane from the elevator shaft. The hotel staff had even told him the incorrect shaft where the cane was supposed to be. When you stay in a hotel room, you have to have trust that the maids can be trusted. We had bought several souvenirs while we were at the Grand Canyon. We had all of them in the same shopping bag. I put the bag intact in my suitcase when I packed to come home. You can imagine my surprise when two of the cutest souvenirs were gone from the bag.

The decor couldn't be more gaudy, sink was choked and shower knobs wobbly which was about to fall off. The room was a decent size but the furniture and carpeting made it look more of a motel feel.

We decided to stay at The Orleans as a few people we know had recommended them. I looked them up on the internet before making our reservations and noticed that there pool was only open until 7:00 PM and that they did not say if they had a jacuzzi. We very much enjoy ending our fun filled days by relaxing in the jacuzzi while on vacation. So, before making our reservations, I called and was told they had a pool/jacuzzi and that we could use it anytime but that there was no Lifeguard after 7 PM. So I went ahead and made our reservations. Well, our experience of The Orleans was that the facilities are beautiful and very clean and everyone if very friendly there, BUT it was SOOO COLD in the casino I could hardly stand it and even heard several other guests complaining of the temperature. We ate at Don Miguels (Mexican food) which was terrible aside from the chips and dips. We were charged for drinks while sitting at the bar PLAYING video poker....AND at about 9 PM we decided to go to the jacuzzi to thaw out and when we got there the security guard tells us that the pool area is closed and that the \"Health Dept.\" came in last week and fined them for having people in the pool/jacuzzi without a Lifeguard on duty! My husband called to speak to the manager of the hotel about this since I had specifically asked about this prior to making my reservations and the manager acted put out that he had to listen to this complaint and told my husband that he should write it on a suggestion/comment card.....HOW RUDE!!! In my opinion the manager should have at least apologized or perhaps even offered us an upgrade to a room with a jacuzzi tub (if they even have one). So neadless to say we checked out of that hotel the next morning (all of which wasted about a day of our already short vacation) and moved to the Tropicana for the same price and had great access to a variety of casinos and a FABULOUS variety of pools and jacuzzis, some of which are open 24/7.

So, ladies, leave the heels at homes or you'll have blisters - guaranteed - which can really ruin your trip. Staying at the Orleans is nice for return visitors to Vegas because it isn't downtown and yet it isn't on the main strip either. Be prepared for an older crowd. This isn't a sleek trendy place like The Palms or The Hard Rock where the 20 year old wannabees hang out. The Orleans caters to a bit slower crowd, but it's worth it. I was surprised at the cleanliness of the rooms and the decor was fairly modern and new. I didn't notice any faded carpeting or torn upholstery. Very new and very nice. I would definitely recommend staying here to any return visitor. The value is phenomenal, especially during the week. Also, The Orleans has some great restaurants.

When we arrived around midnight, our previous request for 2 adjoining (one king for wife/me and two queens for mom/child) non-smoking rooms could not be fufilled. In fact, both rooms would end up being smoking rooms and one was on the 2nd floor and the other was on the 18th. The hotel promised we would be moved to non-smoking rooms the next day. I was not happy, but I understood that these things sometimes happen so it was not a huge issue. I did angle for some type of \"compensation\" but no to no avail. After we trudged our way all the down the looooong hall on the 19th floor, the room key wouldn't work....because the room was still occupied! We hiked back down the looong hall and back to the registration desk. The hotel apologized for the mixup and found us another room on the 2nd floor. The 2nd floor hall was very smokey, but luckily the rooms were not too bad smokewise. Both rooms had two queens, so my wife and I had to sleep in separate beds. My bed and pillow was not comfortable. The Good: By 3pm the next day we eventually got moved to adjoining non-smoking rooms on the 19th floor (loooong walk, but that ended up being a good thing) with the proper bedding arrangements. The view of the strip was great and the rooms were nicely sized and seemed very clean. The TV's have built in Internet service (5.99 for 2 hours). I suspect that is a good deal, but I resisted. The bed was more comfortable and we asked for 3 extra pillows (and got 2 due to short supply) and also requested and received a small refrigerator. The casino was fine, but a little smokey. I only realized this after side trips to other casinos that maybe had better ventilation. Or perhaps because this is a popular locals casino, and the locals seem to smoke like crazy. Since we sometimes smoke ourselves while drinking/gambling it was not that big of a deal to us. Slots and drink service were fine (even in the nickel slots). The cocktail waitresses are very fine. The coffee shop (steak and eggs for 1.99 after midnight!) and Don Miguels were also fine. We had breakfast at the French Quarter buffet, and thought it was a good value, but didn't get to try the lunch or dinner buffet. Terrible Mikes, Subway, Kate's Corner and Seattles Best all met expectations. We didn't get to try Sazio and the Prime Rib Loft, but all restaurnt prices were reasonable I wish we stayed longer so we could have tried thm all. We played in the video arcade, went bowling and my mom and my daughter went to the movies. The shuttle to the strip was very convenient and we saw no need to rent a car. \"Rock This Town\" appearing on Tuesday nights at Brendans Irish Pub was a GREAT and friendly band with a very good Elvis impersonator appearing later in the show. The keyboard player was fantastic. We had an excellent time and stayed there all night. It was so much fun we didn't even gamble that night. Odds n Ends: The loong walk to our room ended up being a blessing because the hotel was doing renovations with jackhammering next to the elevators during, so we ended up far away and insulated from the terrible racket. We felt sorry for those rooms closer to the elevators. The bathrooms were nicely sized. No vent, but there is a window that opens in the hot and powerful shower/tub. Also, no closet in the room, just a big clothes rod and shelf in the bathroom. Maid service was fine. 75 cents per local phone call. The funbook is a great value. The pool and pool area seemed very nice, but we didn't try it due to my daughter's slight cold. And a Walgreens is within walking distance so we were able to buy sundries and cough medicine at a decent price. The hotel gift shop was standard, but I did notice reasonable prices on bottles of soda/water etc. price.

This place was everything it was supposed to be. We stayed Feb 29th thru March 4th and was very happy with our stay. When we arrived, there was no line at the desk. We were quickly checked in and on our way to our rooms. My group had 3 rooms and 2 should have been kings but were doubles. They quickly had us king rooms a few doors apart on a high floor (we requested a high floor). They did not ask us if we wanted a strip view room like I expected from the other reviews I had read. I had planned to turn it down anyway because I've had strip view rooms elsewhere and actually wanted a view of the mountains. The room was quite spacious and clean like I had hoped. I like large rooms and it was very comfortable. It was just as the other reviews described with the little dressing area in with the bathroom and the little window. The bed was GREAT! VERY comfortable! They should put in another pillow or two. This place has everything! It may be off the strip but you really don't need to leave. All types of restaurants. They had alot of $5 Blackjack tables and $2 Craps if you like Craps but want to play cheap. The bowling alley was nice but when we went to bowl, all 70 lanes were being used by local leagues. That kind of sucked. You would think they would have a bowling alley somewhere else or they would at least keep some lanes for the people staying at the property. Sazios, the Italian restaurant was excellent. The French Quarter Buffet was very good. The Oyster bar was good also but I thought the best buy was the Courtyard Cafe'. Not a buffet (I don't care for buffets much) and reasonably priced. Especially the Graveyard Specials after midnight. $.99 eggs, bacon... and $1.99 steak and eggs. We all felt like the Casino was pretty easy to get around in. It was a big place but it never seemed to take long to get where you wanted to go. They had a little lounge area with free entertainment and the in house liquor store had prices that cannot be beat. Everyone was friendly and the waitresses outfits are pretty skimpy. What didn't I like? ............... Just a few things. None of the slot machines took or dispenced coins. Most casinos seem to be going to this. I have always liked walking into a casino and hearing the coin hitting the tray. Things are alot quieter this way. The slots were very tight although one of our party hit for $160.00 once. The slots seemed pretty tight everywhere we went. (2) Their comp system sucks. Even though I won a little at the tables I played quite a bit and couldn't even get 2 small meals amounting to $30 comped. A couple of guys with us spent a total of about 23 hours at the Black Jack tables in 3 days and got offered a free buffet. I was VERY unimpressed. (3) The poker room was locals. Always pretty full and no-one was having fun. It was all business. I would recommend finding a different place to play poker. I could go on and on but bottom line is that The Orleans is a great place to stay. Getting to the strip was easy enough on the shuttles. The biggest surprise was that contrary to most reviews, the casino was not smokey at all. I am an ex-smoker and really don't like it, but I had no problems with the air quality in the Orleans.

I was looking for a Hotel that was affordable, but also classy, and The Orleans was just fantastic in every way. We stayed on the 19th floor, after doing the upgrade at check-in, for an extra $10 a night, and it was a wonderful room. Great view of the strip, the room was spotless, smelled great, and the beds were very comfortable. I was really concerned about the beds, after reading some of the reviews, but no problem for us. We did ask for 2 extra pillows, as there were 3 of us, and also gave a 2 dollar tip with the request. The staff was extremely friendly, always lots of smiles, but it wasn't on a busy weekend, so that may have made a difference. Security is really good, and easy to just wave your room card as you head to the elevator. Our room was very quiet, hardly heard a sound from anywhere. The French Market buffet was excellent, so much food, and good quality too. I really didn't notice the casino being as smokey as so many other reviews have stated, and all three of us are non-smokers, and one with asthma. We played only the penny and 2 cent slots, and there are a lot of them! They paid off real well for me, not huge amounts, but enough to keep me playing for 4 days! The only complaint I have is that the comp card I got was defective, and I didn't realize it until the second day, and I had already lost so many points. So make sure you pay attention if you play the slots with your cards. The shuttle service runs almost continuously, and it is so very easy to get back and forth to the strip, and we always felt like we had \"come home\" when getting off the shuttle and walking into the Orleans. We tried a lot of the slots on the strip, and what a waste of time!!! The big casinos are so tight, hardly worth the time, but fun to walk through.

If you are handicapped, or \"physically challenged\", make sure you request a room closest to the elevator. The crowd in this hotel/casino is pretty middle of the road people plus freaks (it's not at all a great place for young singles). Overall it seemed pretty mixed, not pretentious-just down to earth. I did not find the casino floor here any more smoke filled than other casinos. Some of the reviewers commented on that issue but I have asthma and was not bothered by it. My hotel room smelled clean and fresh-no smoke there. I was happy with the cocktail waitresses-they asked frequently if we wanted drinks-that was cool. I LOVED the sushi restaurant-(Koji's) even though it was SO overpriced. But if you go there get \"Sex on a roll\". It was KILLER!!!! My boyfriend ate at Don Miguels (Mexican) and he said it was pretty average. I had a Margarita there (3.75) but chips and salsa were extra. The Courtyard Cafe offered some decent breakfast which was reasonable. DON'T, DO NOT eat at Sazio's. It is equivalent to Olive Garden with infinitely worse service. We walked in without knowing how bad the quality of the food was going to be. We ordered a salad first. We also ordered drinks (average at best) The drinks came but the salad didnt and neither did any bread. We got our entrees but the waitress didnt deliver them. We told the guy who gave us our food about not getting our salad and he said he'd take it off the bill. The waitress didnt come by until AFTER we were done eating and said \"You didnt get your salad?\" She was clueless and inattentive. I was hoping the food would make up for the poor service. The food was atrocious. Barilla dried pasta (or its equivalent) with DRIED basil mixed in the sauce and NO fresh parmesan cheese. This is a DISASTER for Italian restaurants that are more expensive than average. My dish was not \"Affordable\" like they say about the restaurant, and at 13.50 for pasta-it should be fresh pasta with fresh basil, and they should ask me if I want parmesan cheese grated on top. Instead, they had Kraft Parmesan cheese sitting on the table which was meant for the pizza. I don't know who Gustav Mauler is, but he is \"supposed\" to be the \"Master Chef\" of the restaurant. No Master chef would serve the crap we ate. Aside form the food I think that if you want to stay at a reasonable hotel that is off the strip this is a good place to go. They also have a shuttle to go to/from their other 2 casinos (none to the airport). It was also close to the strip.

A group of my friends go to Las Vegas for an annual get together, and I joined them for the first time. Actually, I wanted to stay at one of the big name strip hotels, but when I checked into The Orleans, I was taken by surprise. My room was very large with a sofa, chair, and coffee table; this was a surprise to me. There was a dressing room where the sink, blow dryer, closet, and ironing board was located, and the room had a door that could be closed for privacy from the sitting and sleeping area, and it had a door that closed in order to give privacy to someone who may be showering or using the facilities. This made it nice too in case you had other people in your room, and you wanted extra privacy for using the facilities. There was a desk against a wall that could be used for business and/or another vanity area. I used it to study and to style my hair (I know, who goes to Vegas to study? I had mid-terms coming up.) Comfortable bed too, and extra pillows in the dressing room. The only thing that I disliked about the room was the distance from the elevator; I felt like there should have been a shuttle service from my room to the elevator; however, I am a smoker, and I know that we aliens have to be housed in outer space to accommodate our habits :-). The Mexican restuarant was okay, but nothing special. The buffet was a hit with all of the different choices to pick from: Italian, Mexican, Chineese, Southwestern, and plenty more. I missed going to a show, but there is a theatre and a bowling alley, but I did catch a Blues show in the pub; it was fantastic. Didn't win any money, but I had a great time. I returned in October, and the only difference was the room, which was a disability friendly room, because my best friend who is a stroke survivor needed these accommodations. Everything was nice, and they had biggest roll in shower that I have seen. I loved the shower so much that I would reserve one of these rooms for myself if I wasn't an alien smoker.

Also, try the city bus to get up and down the Strip, only two dollars a person and they announce all of the major hotels/attractions. We liked the casino at The Orleans more than the larger casinos we visited, they have slots from a penny to five dollars, and you can actually find a seat at five dollar pai gow or three dollar blackjack. Fifty cent roulette all the time, too. The bowling alley and movie theater were great. The Courtyard Cafe is a good choice for breakfast, stay away from the buffet.

Each morning we met for the $4.99 breakfast buffet and requested the same friendly waitress each day. The food was wonderful and great variety (hence, we needed the fitness facility to work off the extra calories). One evening we ate at the Japanese restaurant, then went to the 60 lane bowling alley for a rip-roaring time at bowling (after a few beers, it was hilarious!) We all tried our luck briefly at the slots, but the biggest payoff seemed to be the poker tables. We took the shuttle everywhere and it was convenient and easy to get around the Las Vegas strip.

Also the casino itself is a bit rundown and has very tight machines. I am not a video poker player but a slot player, but the slots were far and few. Everywhere you looked there were video poker machines and I can truly say they were not impressive or hitting at all. We did most of our gambling on the strip. The hotel is a bit remote from the strip and even though it is approximately 5 minutes away, the shuttle service leaves a lot to be desired as you feel like all you do is wait for the bus to arrive. I will give kudo's to the housekeeping staff as our room was well maintained, the beds comfortable and the halls quiet. The security was a nice added feature as well.

The bed was OK, but we are used to budget motels, so we're not picky. We ate at the French Market Buffet for dinner and breakfast and found it to be good, but not exceptional. We're not gamblers, but we occasionally entertain ourselves at the cheap slots. The casino was large with lots of penny, nickel, and quarter slots, but none of them took coins. The machines required us to insert bills and if we cashed out, returned tickets. That was annoying. We used the free shuttle to The Strip and found it to be convenient. The last shuttle returns to the hotel at 12:30 am, which might be early for some.

The self parking at the Orleans was great, free and close to the door and I am sure we saved some money that way, but overall the hotel was just okay in my opinion. The one thing that really stood out was the Spa however. It looked like it was recently renovated or built and had a whole different look than the rest of the hotel, which was on the tacky side. The spa was very classy and a really nice break the day I used my coupon to go. I suggest to all the ladies: USE YOUR SPA COUPON!!! It is beautiful! The excersize room looks out at the pool area, there are urns with chilled bottled water everywhere, new age music playing, and the free locker has slippers, etc. for you to use. I didn't purchase any of the spa services but really enjoyed the time there to use their equipment. I guess I am writing alot about the spa because it was the one highlight of the hotel. The buffet was a good value compared to other buffets, but had a run down, nothing special atmosphere. The beds I have to agree with the lady who wrote on this site are VERY hard because they are just a 4\" piece of foam over the box spring. Not a real mattress. I was okay with it but like a real mattress much better. I wouldn't stay there again I'm afraid. We did call one night to housekeeping for extra pillows and they never came. Then I left a note for the maid for extra pillows the next day and still nothing. . .In summary, the money you save staying here isn't worth the aggravation to get to the Strip each day/night.

We made our decision based entirely on the rave reviews posted here. I feel like we must have somehow stayed at an Orleans Hotel in an alternate universe! Overall, we were deeply disappointed. We arrived about 8 p.m. on Saturday night. We used the self-parking because all the lines for the valet parking had at least 10 cars waiting in them. We drove around the hotel (VERY pretty exterior) several times trying to figure out the best place to park, and finally chose one of the parking structures. It was a LONG walk winding through the casino (carting all our luggage) to get to the front desk. We had to ask directions twice. When we asked the clerk where the best place to park was, she directed us to where we HAD parked. The front desk is ONLY convenient to the valet parking! Check-in was speedy, but not one time did anyone offer assistance with our luggage. We found our room easily, and were pleased with its location. We had requested a specific room due to a recommendation in a TripAdvisor review, and were glad we did. The view of the Strip lights was great, considering how far off the Strip The Orleans is. It was a smoking room, but smelled fresh and clean. The room (1740) was very attractive and spacious, and in good condition. Also quiet - we never heard so much as a closing door from our neighbors during our entire stay. Once we figured out how the odd thermostat worked, the A/C worked very well and quietly. But the bed was a nightmare! My husband threw himself down on it, and almost knocked himself unconscious. Not on the nightstand, on the MATTRESS! Or what they call a mattress. We prefer a firm bed, but this was ridiculous. We were so shocked by its hardness that we pulled the sheets back to investigate. The \"mattress\" was nothing but a 4-inch-thick dense foam pad on top of the box springs, with a rubber sheet over it. There was no coffeemaker, but we knew there wouldn't be, and had brought our own. When my husband went to get ice, he had to go up to the next floor, because the ice machine on our floor was broken. It remained so all the time we were there, even though we reported it every day. The next morning, we went down to take advantage of the \"99-cent breakfasts,\" only to learn that they are only offered Monday-Thursday. At the Mexican restaurant that night, we waited 45 minutes for our food, while seeing two other groups that had been seated AFTER we had ordered get served before we did. We had ordered simple combo plates, nothing special. The waiter never offered any explanation or compensatory drinks or anything. And the food was mediocre. We ate the rest of our meals away from the hotel. Two other things we'd read in reviews here that were false: the pool area is NOT open 24 hours - we were there on an August weekend, and it was still only open 9 a.m.-10 p.m. Neither is the in-hotel liquor store - it closed at midnight. The bowling alley looked nice, but was closed both times we stopped by. Another big complaint: the maid service was not very thorough. We had kicked the heavy bedspread off onto the floor, and when we came back after the maid's visit, it was piled up in a corner of the floor - not even folded, much less replaced on the bed. After the next visit, there were still pieces of cellophane from a wrapper we'd opened on the floor (so much for vacuuming!). And we had left in a hurry, leaving the ironing board set up. The maid did not put it away. She DID always leave the bathroom spotless. And the pretty window in the bathroom that actually OPENS was WONDERFUL! As for the toiletries, they were plentiful, but of average quality. Nothing special. We aren't big gamblers, so I can't comment on the casino. Our last morning, we attempted to use the in-room TV checkout, but it was \"offline.\" We voiced our complaints at checkout, and were given a certificate good for two free nights, which we won't be using unless they upgrade their beds! My advice is: If you want a great \"has it all\" hotel in Vegas, stay at Sam's Town. It's farther off the Strip, but well worth the drive (and the beds are to die for)!", "Date": "September 11, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood?

Alas, I was very irritated and it was impossible to sleep. However, the front dest was kind enough to give us 2 comp buffets, (a savings of about 15 bucks) Whatever, its sad to say that such a great hotel would still be greedy and book rooms where obviously the guests would be disturbed. owell, otherwise I would have given the stay an A+. when you check in...make sure to ask whether they are remodeling or converting any rooms and on what floor....", "Date": "September 6, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Goodyear, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1271147", "Content": "A friend who was visiting had never been to Las Vegas, so I booked us in at the Orleans.

The previous night was spent at the Stratosphere. Having read the reviews of both, which imply the Stratosphere to be dubious and the Orleans to be exquisite, I was surprised to find them to be quite equal overall, had I not had some problems that Orleans refused to deal with. Overall, the Orleans is a nice place to stay, and a bargain, but I'm absolutely baffled by its #1 rating on tripadvisor, and by people who rave that they'll take care of problems for you. For me, they didn't. I'd stay at Stratosphere (love their casino, observation deck, and rides) or Gold Rush (love their buffet) before I'd go back to Orleans.Here is the story: I had not been sure whether I'd be arriving in Las Vegas on August 17 or 18, so I booked and prepaid for a room at Orleans for August 18. Note that I said one room. It was booked on usairways.com (where I was Chairman's Preferred during 1999, 2000, and 2001...and I tend to still use them for reservations) and appeared to have been made by usairways.com using Travelocity, who in turn booked it at a SABRE prepaid rate of $33.93 Before leaving for vacation on August 12, I checked my USAirways reservations, and there it was: one room at Orleans 8/18, prepaid and nonrefundable for $33.94. Then I checked my credit card and there were two identical charges 2 days apart for $36.25 each. Presumably SABRE, Travelocity, USAirways, or someone along the line decided to take the extra $2.31 per day. No big deal, certainly not the fault of the hotel. But charging TWO days instead of ONE day is a big deal. Not the hotel's fault, but also not my fault. Just hopefully a problem that they or I can fix, short of doing a credit card chargeback, right? WRONG!!The first time I tried booking it online, the (USAirways.com) website bombed out (some typical \"Cannot complete transaction, maybe you hit the back button, or maybe a software error\" message) and never finished, never sent the confirming email, and never showed up as a reservation in my usairways account status. So two days later, I checked that it hadn't gone through, then I tried again, and it did show up OK. So I leave for vacation with one room showing on the reservation site. One confirmation number for one room. And two rooms charged, two days apart, on my online credit card statement with precious little info other than \"Discount Hotel\" in Texas. (Turns out to be an alias for SABRE's charges.)A few days before arriving at Orleans, I call them and ask if I have one room or two, and tell them the whole sad story. I offer to either arrive there on the 17th instead of 18th, and call it even by taking one room for 2 nights, or to cancel the extra room which was never actually purchased by me, but was charged to my card by SABRE in error.They refuse to do either thing, but offer to sell me a room on the 17th for $59 in addition. So I can pay 3-1/2 days rate for 2 days, or pay 2 days rate for 1 day. Thanks, but no thanks.Orleans refused to deal with tracking down what went wrong at SABRE or USAirways.com, or to just cancel the room without making me do it \"from the travel agent's end\". Mind you I'm sitting in a hotel in Holbrook, Arizona on a Sunday, then burning up cellphone time at Meteor Crater as the telephone chapter of this saga comes to an end and I give up. They give me a number to call at SABRE, but I'd already tried that, and the \"traveler\" access on Sunday morning is nonexistent. I have a friend back home chase SABRE (by impersonating a travel agent) and USAirways.com (by impersonating me) with little luck. USAirways told her to either charm the hotel into accepting a cancellation, or to just refuse the second credit card charge....they were honest enough to say that route would be easier than fighting their own system to get them to admit their online error, or to have SABRE fix it.So on the 17th we stay at the Stratosphere, which proves to be a nicer experience for us than the Orleans anyway. Night of the 17th, pump $100 into slots at Stratosphere in a session lasting 4 hours at just one $1 (x2) slot machine, win a $500 jackpot and put it firmly in my wallet. Being up $400, I was tempted to stay at Stratosphere another night and forget the whole Orleans/SABRE/USAirways.com ordeal. But a paid-for room is a paid-for room....so after buying an \"unlimited all day\" pass to the Stratosphere rides, it's off to Orleans we went.They expect me to check into both rooms, and I tell them the whole story, that I only ordered one. I have the confirmation paperwork with me. Fine, they say, but we already have your money for both rooms from SABRE, and we won't let you cancel the room. \"You have to have SABRE cancel it\" they say, and of course at 4:10pm hotel time, the SABRE phone number isn't even taking calls as it's after 6pm CDT. Plus, they say that they're keeping SABRE's money no matter what happens, and that they only want to have me chase SABRE so that I'll get out of paying SABRE. Yikes!So now we get to the room, a nice room. Equally as nice a room as we had at Stratosphere. Only two minor/moderate problems with the room or facilities at Orleans:1. The 150 degree garbage on the other side of the pretty stucco wall from your shady rental car parking spot. 2. The air conditioning controls.The only MAJOR problem is with their money-grubbing reservations folks being unwilling to help fix an error made by neither themselves nor me, even when given plenty of notice about it.Nice view of somewhat distant wasteland from the 12th floor at Orleans, compared to the nice view of the somewhat distant Strip, hotel pool, etc. from the 19th floor at Stratosphere.Both hotels impressed me with clean AC grills or ducts, quite unusual even in nice hotels. Both had nice bathroom floors, walls, fixtures, etc. and were clean. Both made me feel very secure. The Orleans bathroom floor was clearly a color intended to hide dirt, but none was found. The Stratosphere floor was polished black granite and would show dirt easily but none was found.At Orleans, there was a wall AC unit on the exterior wall, and it first appeared that the temperature knob on the AC itself was functional. But in fact, it was disabled, and you had to set a wall thermostat to get it to cool. A bit confusing having to use the on/off/low/hi knob but not the temerature knob on the AC itself. Because the cold air blows right on the thermostat on its journey from the AC to the main part of the room, we found that setting it at about 6-8 degrees lower than you wanted the room to be was required. In other words, attempt #1 of using the AC knob left us sweltering. Attempt #2 of setting 70 degrees left us at maybe 76-78 degrees, and setting it at 64 actually cooled the room. (The AC setup at Stratosphere was nicer and easier to use than at Orleans. Set the very obvious wall thermostat and let the central AC do its job.)Last but not least, a couple of comments about the gambling at Orleans. I was tempted to play Texas Hold'Em, but because of my success at the slots the previous day at Stratosphere, I decided to play slots. If you're looking to take a whack at a large, progressive top prize, maybe Orleans slots are OK. Maybe not. There was not a single machine or section with a posted payback rate. I played for a while and saw why. Either the payback is low, or maybe just so much of the payback is at the extreme long-shot end of the scale, or maybe both. I suspect that for anyone who DOESN'T win the $1.5 million progressive jackpot on a $0.25 slot, you get drained of your money pretty quickly. I found just a few machines with sensibly-sized top prizes, so that I could actually play for a while without it just being \"lottery ticket\" donations to some future big-jackpot winner. And those machines relieved me of $87 in due course. So I should have paid the extra night at Stratosphere and stuck with their marked bank of 98% payback machines. Oh, and one last thing. We decided to take the shuttle to Gold Rush for the buffet. After waiting and waiting to no avail, we took another walk past the dumpster smell and drove our rental car instead. No big deal to us, but to folks relying upon cabs and shuttles, it's something to think about.The Gold Rush buffet was beyond excellent, with all the food very well prepared. Simple stuff unusually well executed, and great dessert selections considering the price.", "Date": "August 23, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant hotel - far from the madding crowds!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1238691", "Content": "My family travelled to Las Vegas for the first time (10th to 14th August 2003) and booked the Orleans on the strength of the reviews on Trip Advisor - you were all absolutely right, it's a great place to be!!
