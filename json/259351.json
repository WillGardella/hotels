It was also beautifully quiet - even the on-street room we had was silent in the evenings and mornings. We took the hotel breakfast 2 of our 3 mornings; at 10 euros pp we thought it was a bit pricey - until we ate out one morning. Gulp! Paris food prices are quite frightening these days (eg, 6 euros for a cafe latte). So we highly recommend the hotel breakfast as it was delicious, including fresh pressed orange juice and beautiful crockery, which is always a nice touch.

Better than average, and great as a business hotel (especially if you manage to get a good rate) with a wonderful location and very friendly staff. It's not, though, a hotel for romance since the rooms are a little bit tired (very clean, well maintained, but just feel a generation or two older than current minimalist boutique hotels, well-designed modern capsule/chain hotels). Beds are comfy but - in Parisian style - take up most of the modest floor space ;) Staff are invariably friendly and helpful at all hours. Street rooms are great and although there's some \"bustle\" they're not noisy and they have the benefit of being able to open windows, hang out and look at l'Odeon. The rooms get a bit stuffy and the aircon is more 'blowing' than 'climate control', but that could have been a winter setting? Top marks for free, effective wifi in the rooms.

We wanted to stay in the left bank and are very pleased to confirm the positive reviews we read on TA. The location is very convenient, on a quiet back-street about 3-4 minutes walk from the Odeon metro stop (two metro lines), 6-7 minutes walk from the Luxembourg stop on the RER, and 10 minutes walk from the St. Michel stop on the metro/RER. Travel by RER to/from either CDG or Orly Airport is simple and straightforward. Many of the most popular sites in Paris are within 10-30 minutes walk (eg, Notre Dame, the Louvre, Luxembourg Gardens, Pantheon, etc.) and others are a short metro ride. You can travel to Versailles in less than one hour from the St. Michel RER. We did not have the hotel breakfast ourselves, but they do offer a buffet-style breakfast for an additional \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12 which is in-line with nearby restaurants. We typically paid between \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8-14 each for breakfast in the area. Neo Caf\u00c3\u00a9 on Blvd. St. Germain was one of the better options. There are many choices for all meals at various prices within short walking distance, ranging from French to other international cuisines (eg, Italian, Vietnamese, Moroccan, Mexican, and others). Our best dinner may have been Vietnamese at Muraile de Jade on Rue de l'Ancienne Com\u00c3\u00a9die. The hotel has about 40 rooms over five floors with an elevator. Our room was on the 4th floor in the front with a flower box in the large, street-facing windows. It was not roomy, but the size is very much in line with typical European hotels. Everything was clean and efficient, and there was plenty of room for our two suitcases including a week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth of autumn clothes. There was also a desk, a small refrigerator, and a safe in the good-sized closet. I was pleasantly surprised to find a thermostat in the room so heating/cooling was easily controlled, ensuring that we were comfortable throughout. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice any noise from either inside or outside the hotel, even with ongoing construction/cleaning on the building across the street. The bathroom was in proportion, but perfectly adequate and equally functional with a hand-held shower and partial glass door. We got better practiced at keeping the floor dry as the week went on. There is free wi-fi throughout the hotel. The front desk staff spoke multiple languages and were very pleasant and helpful, especially when we were hoping to print out the tickets to the Palace of Versailles which we purchased on our phone.

The hotel was in a perfect location on a quiet side street that was a two minute walk from the odeon metro station, and about 5 great restaurants. You are also an easy walk to Notre Dame Cathedral and Rue St Germain. The thing that impressed me the most before we even arrived was how incredibly helpful the staff was. I emailed the hotel in advance to confirm our arrival and was told by Anke that the metro from the airport was under repair. She arranged for a private car to transport us to the hotel. Had she not informed us of this, we would have had a negative start to our first trip to Paris as we were unfamiliar with the transportation system. Anke continued to be incredibly helpful for the duration of our trip. This is an older hotel so as others commented the rooms are not American super sized. For me this was not a big deal as I had researched and anticipated that this was the case. We booked the 2 floor three person room that had two bathrooms, my friend from London met us in Paris and the three of us shared the room and we didn't have any problems with the amount of space. I would recommend this hotel for any upcoming stay and I plan to stay there again for my next trip. On a side note, we found the French people to be incredibly nice and helpful. I had heard rumors about them being rude we did not encounter that. So if you are considering going and are concerned about the people, we found that if we tried to speak as much French as we new and were polite to them, they were very accommodating and helpful to us.

I was somewhat upset when they informed me, just before I was due to stay, that there would be workmen in and that there would be no hot water between 9-6 each day. I still think this was unacceptable as I had booked and paid months earlier - however I was brought a bottle of Champagne to my room on arrival as an apology which was nice of them and I can honestly say that the lack of hot water didn't affect me, I just got up early and usually returned after 6pm anyway. Every single member of staff I dealt with was lovely - sweet and helpful and very friendly and their management should be rightly proud of them. I had breakfast on one day and it was fine - I just don't really 'do' breakfast, but it is good value at 12 euros as I paid 5.50 for just a coffee and you get coffee, juice, breads, croissant, cheese, yoghurt, cereal, ham and salami - and all in a very nice environment. Room was small - they always are in Paris - but had all the things you expect (and I had my terrace too) and it was spotless. The Odeon is steps away and just a bit further the Luxembourg Gardens - and the other way is St Germain and walking distance to Notre Damme etc. One negative for me is that it's noisy especially in the morning (the cleaners are loud from 8am) but most hotels seem to be just as bad in my experience. I was a woman on my own and felt very happy in the hotel - safe and welcome. Oh and the bed, pillows and bedding are very comfortable!

Other reviews have described this well,and your contentment depends on what you expect. For those who are concerned about small rooms, Yes ours was small\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou can walk around the sides of the bed, but just with body width. Tiny bathroom and shower, but that seems par for the location. More importantly, everything was clean. Wireless was free and strong. We appreciated the room was equipped with a pc and good sized monitor. Air conditioning worked well and is adjustable. Faced out on to nondescript building across street, but could see Odeon. Luggage if you arrive before checking in, or depart after checkout- Yes, you can carry your luggage down to a small storage room; judging by the amount there, lots of guest do that. There are no bellmen- this is a small hotel. There is a small elevator, into which we were nonetheless able to squeeze our 3 rollers and two thin bodies, but we heard that some hotels lack elevators. Sound- street is quiet with little car traffic, but some construction that started late enough not to disturb us. We liked the red flowers at each window. Concierge- not really a concierge. The person at an entry table, retrieves keys, provides Paris maps, handles check-in, gives directions, etc., and someone emerges from a back area if more than two people are waiting. They will sell you vouchers, for example for the bateau tours or Follies Bergere tours and are quite pleasant, but if you ask which among the boats have the most entertaining tour, the two desk people we asked, who are locals not familiar with tourist sights, did not know information beyond what is in the tour advertisements, and did not recommend local cafes other than to give directions to the general area. Similar for various types of admission tickets for Versailles or purchasing Eurostar. You will be happier if you do your Trip Advisor research, or bring a guide book. Rather than get on the Metro at Odeon, we usually walked 8-10 minutes to the St Michel station, which includes multiple lines, including regional. Wanting to soak up the Paris atmosphere and rising late, we did not eat breakfast at the hotel (small room off lobby) so cannot comment on that. In the area, you pass multiple statues, and non-tourist storefronts. We found Les Editeurs, a caf\u00c3\u00a9 within two blocks that is frequented by locals and had good omelet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and other food. The interior d\u00c3\u00a9cor is bookshelves along the walls. A restaurant across the square always had a line. A nearby green crepe cart, recommended by the desk person, makes delicious desert crepes as you watch. There is also a caf\u00c3\u00a9 in front of the Odeon theatre, which is 200 steps from the hotel door. To snack at Jardin du Luxembourg or just to see the colorful view in the window, try Gerard Mulot (on Du Seine a few blocks away) which has the typical wonderful croissants, chocolate that makes a nice hostess gift, many tasty items (including some salads, all carry out) and a rude (at least to Americans) staff of the sort that I had seen in Paris years ago but not experienced recently, except at this patisserie. If you want to grab a quick baked item on the way to some sight (not the leisurely cafe experience where your vill is not delivered unless you ask) you will pass some, and there is a good one on a side street near St Michel metro. On the same block as Jardin de L'Odeon,if you find it too full, there were 2 similar looking hotels, both of which seemed fine. Our priorities were location with atmosphere, in walking distance of many sights, and clean rooms, rather than view of the river or sights, larger room, and extensive hotel services. Our goals were met in our 3-night stay, and we would be happy to stay at Jardin de L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Odeon again.", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, with the best staff!\u201d", "Author": "PaulGK", "ReviewID": "UR116085214", "Content": "The staff is tremendous!

Travelling by myself I chose my hotel very carefully. I was looking for a hotel that was well situated, comfortable and affordable for a solo traveller. (We usually have to pay double, don't we!) I came across this doing a google search for a hotel in the Saint Germain des Pres area and after cross referencing it with TripAdvisor i decided to book it. Booking ahead there was a very attractive reduction in the room rate. Not knowing the hotel I know this could have been a bit of a risk but it turned out very well for me. I was put into Room 58 which I found to be an excellent room. Hotel rooms in paris are not renowned for their spaciousness but I found this room very pleasant with every facility in it I could need - including an iMac which doubled as a TV and media centre - great fun and very useful in the evenings when I returned to the room. (Free wi-fi and intenet access on the iMac) The only thing that maybe took away from it was a few shelves would not have gone amiss for storing clothes/cosmetics etc but it was not a disaster! There was a closet with hangers that served their purpose. There was also a safe deposit box in the room. The hotel staff was professional, polite and friendly - even the morning I returned to the hotel three times in quick succession in order to retrieve/replace items I had forgotten about! They also spoke good English and were very patient with a hesitant speaker of French! The location of the hotel was excellent. near the Latin Quarter and Boulevard St Germain des Pres - so no end to things to do, places to visit or bars and cafes for meals in the evening. i also felt very safe here. The hotel was in a quiet street that was nearby everything - including the Odeon Metro stop and useful bus routes. The breakfast was good and wasn't that much more expensive than some of the breakfast deals in the area. There was a good selection of cold meats, cereals, yoghurts, cheese etc. There was even 'toast' available.

We stayed for one night back in 2008, so knew what to expect. I measured the room (!) to be 12' x 14' (15 m2) including the bathroom - but in fact, this was actually more than adequate!

One morning it was quiet enough, but on other mornings, it really gave me a headache and I couldn't wait to leave the room.

Otherwise very friendly and competent. OTHER TIPS - use the Velib bikes! If you are any way fit, you will have such fun and see Paris in a totally connected way! If you fancy an Italian meal, try the Marco Polo (walk downhill from hotel towards Blvd. St. Germain) - the best we've had in any country. But if that's booked up, then don't bother with the other Italian nearby (Il Suppli) - it's very ordinary and service is poor, for the same price as Marco Polo.

My friend and I were lucky enough to stay in room 64 on the 6th floor with a terrace overlooking the theater. Equipped with a table and chairs, it made a perfect setting for wine and cheese before setting out to dinner in the evening and for breakfast in the morning, which the staff will happily deliver to your room. The room we stayed in was perfect for two people and was very chic! The bed was extremely comfortable, as well. The bathroom is on the small side, but as one who travels to Paris often, it does not bother me in the least. This is to be expected from an older building. The cleaning staff is to be highly commended, as the room and bathrrom was always spic and span. As for the front desk staff, Jenny, Ines, Quentin and Mosbah, they were outstanding Each one of them is extremely helpful and nice and willing help with any needs you may have. I cannot praise them enough for making our stay the best I have had in Paris. As a last note, the neighborhood is excellent. The street is quiet and there are many nearby places to dine and shop. Went to Le Comptoir one night, which was memorable for sure. Also dined at a nearby spot, La Ferrandaise, recommended by Jenny. The food was outstanding and the atmosphere quaint!

For example, in a suite which costs hundreds of euro per night, you don't even get tea/coffee-making facilities! Also the bathrooms are tiny and come with tea-towels instead of bath towels!

I was able to \"McGuyver\" the shower head to stay up on its own, but for a nice *** hotel, I did expect better. Other than that, only rave reviews of the hotel, staff, and room. The terrace was large with a table and 2 chairs. We managed to have a few drinks outside in the afternoons (we lucked out with cool but not cold weather) and breakfast the morning we checked out. There is a luggage room in the basement where we stored our bags both in and outbound. Breakfast was okay (we only had breakfast there once) for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12 per person but not great. I would recommend against breakfast at the hotel; but for convenience it is okay. Like anywhere in Paris, parking is difficult. I did manage to find one of the many Vinci parking garages and paid only \u00e2\u201a\u00ac55 for three nights total, which for Paris is cheap! The Odeon metro stop is a two block from the hotel. Shops, restaurants, pubs, taverns, and bakeries are plentiful around the hotel.

This time, the stay wasn't nearly as perfect as last time, but overall it was still a pretty positive experience. The room I got was tiny compared to the one I stayed in last year--there was no room for a luggage rack. The Prestige room was also extremely small, with a tiny bathroom that had a very small shower stall only--no bathtub--and no counter space. It's a good thing both my sister and niece are petite, because I don't see how a large person could have taken a shower in that tiny stall! Based on this experience, I would say that it's not at all worth paying for a Prestige room. The only Prestige-room extras seemed to be bathrobes and slippers and an IMac computer that doubled as a TV. (On the other hand, the Prestige room lacked the mini-fridge that the Classic rooms have.) The design touches in the Prestige room included a fake-animal-fur bedspread that we all found a bit creepy. I actually preferred the more restrained decor (and normal bedspread) of the Classic room. Breakfast was very pleasant, with excellent service, but for 7 nights in a row, it became sort of monotonous. Next time, I'd definitely try some of the nearby cafes for breakfast. On the last morning of my stay, my bathroom was flooded by a deluge of water from above. It was a good thing I happened to be in my room at the time and was able to alert the front desk right away, or the flood would have been much worse and my belongings would have suffered serious damage. It turned out that the water damage originated from my sister's room when the shower was turned on, so we were both inconvenienced because my sister and niece weren't able to use their shower and my bathroom was flooded. At my request, the hotel did scramble to clean another room for our temporary use until our check-out time, but preparing the substitute room took about an hour and did somewhat ruin our last morning in Paris. (If I hadn't requested the substitute room, I don't think anyone at the hotel would have done anything to remedy the situation for us.) We experienced brief electrical black-outs on two different nights during our week-long stay, so it's a good idea to pack a mini-flashlight and keep it handy. During my stay last year, housekeeping standards were exemplary. This time, things were clean overall, but housekeeping seemed more haphazard--sometimes they forgot to replenish toiletries or towels, and we had to ask at the front desk for these things. I'm not sure if this is a general deterioration of the hotel's standards, or just bad luck on our part. Overall, despite the various issues we encountered, I would definitely consider staying at the Jardin again, esp. at the bargain rates I booked (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac104/night for the Classic room and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac125/night for the Prestige room).

I can honestly say that the reception at this hotel (specifically, Penelope, who worked during the morning/day) was outstanding in terms of customer service. She was extremely helpful, warm, professional, and wanted to ensure that our stay was pleasurable. The hotel is located literally steps away from the Odeon Theatre, and a block or two away from the Odeon Metro and the apex where great cafe/bars are, such as Le Comptoir, Les Editeurs, and the Horse's Tavern. It's also about four or five blocks away from Gerard Mulot, which makes amazing croissants, macarons, and food you can take away with you to go to the Jardin Luxembourg (also just two blocks away from the hotel) and enjoy a lovely picnic in the park. Some pros about the hotel: location, location, location. In the Latin Quarter/St-Germain area, I don't think we could have picked a more perfect location. Service was excellent, as was the cleanliness of the room, the housekeeping, etc. We were fortunate enough to receive a room that had a private terrace, and I can tell you that on a summer night, we couldn't have had a more pleasurable amenity than that. Staring up at the stars, at the perfectly kept and manicured flowers -- it was quite lovely. Housekeeping came every day, lovely toiletries products, made the bed perfectly and left little candies on our pillows. The room must have been recently renovated. We felt safe in the area, and taken care of by staff. Really close to the Metro and the RER if you are coming from CDG -- Luxembourg RER B is the way to go and very easy to get to the hotel from there. Cons: Super uncomfortable beds. They are really firm and you can feel the springs digging into your body. I went so far as to ask for extra pillows to slip under the bedsheets to make my own makeshift pillowtop mattress. Also, the room (we just got a regular, basic room) was very, very small, which is ok -- you're in Paris, why do you need a big room? Sleeping is definitely an issue since the walls are very thin and you can hear everything. We tried to take a nap during the day and if someone left or entered their room, the door closing made a noise similar to a gunshot, and we immediately woke up. We also ordered room service (had to call down about 3x before someone answered -- but this was later at night). Room service is only cold food and for what you get, it is EXTREMELY expensive, so I would definitely skip it if you can. Go across the street to La Cambuse (restaurant) and for 20 Euro you can get a great prix fixe meal. Conclusion: Listen, we purchased a basic room at a very reasonable rate (160 Euros a night via their website) in the height of tourist season. Their service and location are incredible, but you get what you pay for -- if you go for the basic room, be prepared to have a very small room, with a small bed and an extremely small bathroom (beware ladies, you may not be able to have room to bend over and shave your legs!). While it is clean and charmingly decorated, my biggest problem was the bed -- I just wish it was comfortable! Also, the double bed really isn't made for two adults -- so that part was disappointing. I would definitely take one for the team and go back, though. I've had enough encounters with rude reception at another Paris hotel near CDG to make me appreciate what we had here at the Hotel Jardin. Again, the location was absolutely perfect.

Only a sliver of a closet (with awful, attached hangers, no dresser, no surfaces to work on, no chair other than the desk chair. The small desk was entirely occupied by a large TV/computer. When I asked to see a bigger room with more space to unpack, they were very accommodating. My new room, #18, was on the 1st floor (a lot less time spent waiting for the slow elevator). The bathroom wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as spiffy but the tub had a nice strong shower. The closet had some shelves and the TV was on top of the mini-bar (water and sodas only & totally lacking in the first room) liberating the desk for me to use. Still no chair other than the desk chair unless a tiny stool, useful only for resting my daypack, counts. One of the nicest things about this room is the lovely outlook, past window boxes of pink hydrangea, into the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bitty garden. Several rooms have balconies, by the way. Breakfast was also good. The coffee was excellent and it was a decent value for 12 Euros. Having breakfast in my room helped get me out into the city sooner in the mornings, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fun to breakfast at one of the cafes nearby. Most important, the staff, was professional and helpful. They seemed to really want their guests to be happy. The uppity attitude that sometimes comes from the French was totally lacking. There is excellent free wifi through most of the hotel. However the connection in my second room was spotty. They assured me this would be fixed soon however. In sum, a nice Left Bank hotel, quiet, well located, nice people. Is it worth 255 Euros a night? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure about that.", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cPerfect First Trip to Paris.\u201d", "Author": "Nik D", "ReviewID": "UR67834698", "Content": "Ok, so it wasn't exactly perfect seeing as we missed our flight from London on the Friday night.

The room was clean and just as we expected, and we were very pleased with the size of the bathroom too. The room service was also a bonus, being available until 1am and the food was great. The best thing, though, is the location. We found Saint Germain to be the most delightful, laid back, and culture filled part of Paris and a great base to see the city from. Notre Dame is a 10 minute stroll and you can take the Batobus to see all the major attractions in a day. Highly advised at 13 Euros per person, a boat every 15 minutes, and you can hop on and off at any time and as many times throughout the day. In two days we saw Notre Dame, The Louvre, The Eiffel Tower, L'Arc de Triomphe, shopped on Rue des Francsbourgeois, and saw so much more.

Our room was No. 62, small but pretty, it had a bathtub (a big plus in winter) and faced the inner courtyard.

Matthieu at reception was very helpful and efficient. The new rooms are more expensive (we paid around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac150 per night - internet discount rate) and I think what the hotel is doing is to increase room rates progressively as the plan is to renovate the entire hotel in due course. If this results in higher rates overall it will be a real shame and somehow also unfair on all the old clientele who made the hotel into such a hot spot by virtue of great tripadvisor reviews about the modest price and excellent service. I hope that Jardin de L'Odeon will not commercially over-exploit its popularity and hike up the room rates. One recommendation for the hotel: the luggage room is on the lower ground floor. It has a lock, but it is not locked and is open to access for guests who want to leave their luggage there if they are checking in early or checking out and sightseeing before departure. It would be good to lock the room and only give keys to guests who are dropping off or picking up their luggage. Like that the security arrangements would be enhanced.

Location: - Overall, the location was good. As this was my first time to Paris, I wasnt sure what to expect or where to go. Based on previous reviews, I expected the hotel to be very close to many attractions. In reality, this was not the case. It wasnt as close as the previous reviews led me to believe. Although getting around in Paris was easy using their Metros. With that being said, once the hotel was located - getting to the Metro station (Oleon) was quite easy. Turn right out the door, cross one street, down steps to the left and you are there next to the Metro station across from Starbucks. Service: - I believe this was the best part of the hotel. Very Very helpful staff. Anything you needed they would help you with. Minor details such as getting coffee in the lobby - I approached to make it myself and they came over and \"prepared it\" for me.. Great service and again very friendly. Getting Around: -Getting to major attractions wasnt too difficult upon finding the Metro. I used the M4 to connect with most places...generally I would go to St Michael Metro station to connect with either the RER's or other metros. St Michael is the very next stop north of Oleon. Dining: -Hotel has room service until (I believe 0200). The menu is somewhat limited although the food is good. If you are not into room service, there are plenty of restaurants quite literally right around the corner. Places such as Mediterranean Restaurant and a GREAT sushi restaurant for very very cheap (delicious) as well. Misc: -Overall, I would definitely stay here again and recommend to my friends. Its a very good deal for the money and great service.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel in the centre of Paris\u201d", "Author": "leetaxor", "ReviewID": "UR53197608", "Content": "Like most very central hotels, the rooms in Jardin de L'Odeon are relatively small, but the standards are very high.

And the bathroom is a great size so nothing to complain about there. The free wireless is a great plus as well. The breakfast is served until 10:30 which is quite nice if you have been out late. Most places don't serve that late. It is a typical breakfast - meats, breads, etc. They bring you orange juice and coffee though the coffee is a bit strong. Think you can order boiled eggs but they were out when we asked. The one complaint I would have is that the rooms are quite thin and it can make for a noisy morning. But again, this does not seem unusual for Paris. I am rating this 5 stars based on expectations for a hotel in this price range in Paris. I don't know what it costs to book a room normally but if you are coming from London, use railbookers.com and get a package deal with Eurostar.

Lovely French windows overlooked a quiet street and the Odeon Theatre. Taxi drivers don't seem to know the street or the hotel, but just ask them to take you to the theatre. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant, but it does have room service and a breakfast nook. It also offers Wi-Fi, though I didn't test it, and English-language television (the BBC). The cons: bathrooms are basic, the walls a bit thin, and the front desk short-staffed. The quality of breakfast left something to be desired, but if you're in a hurry, it'll do and at 10 EUR per person is reasonable.

All the staff were in good spirits and happy to help, either by directing us to the required bus stops and telling us the number bus we needed for our destination, or ordering cabs for us - which turned up on time all the time! Around the hotel they were courteous and charming. It was easy to get to each 'touristy' destination from where we were. Notre Dame is a short walk, and oodles of good restaurants and cafes nearby - Les Deux Magots and Cafe de Flore being the obvious 'famous' choices. Jardin de Luxembourg is on your doorstep, but the 'big' sites are never more than 10 mins bus or metro away - and Paris public transport is all very cheap and easy to use. You could still walk to the Louvre if one wished. Our cab to the Moulin Rouge was only about \u00c2\u00a320. We were in central Paris, but it was still relaxed and not too busy a district.

After researching Paris accomodation, we settled on the Jardin de L'Odeon for numerous reasons. First and foremost and based on prior reviews here on Tripadvisor, were the wonderful staff. We mainly dealt with the Corsican gent and Laotian lady (apologies for not remembering names) and they were always very helpful and pleasant. The reception was staffed 24 hours a day, so when we had to call for a taxi really early one morning it wasn't a problem. Similarly on the day we were leaving Paris, the staff advised us of a public transport strike affecting the RER line to CDG airport and they made arrangements for a van to take us to the airport. This thoughtfulness was certainly appreciated. Secondly was the location. The hotel is in a very small and quiet backstreet so there is little street or crowd noise to bother you at night. The St Germain area is full of interesting shops, restaurants, bars, cafes etc. Do go to the nearby Gerard Mulot Patisserie, we were in sweet heaven! Main tourist attractions such as the Louvre and Notre Damme were within 15 min walking distance of the hotel. To go further afield the nearby Odeon metro station was very conveniant. Just make sure you buy a sturdy and detailed street map because you will need to orient yourself if walking around Paris a lot. The room at the hotel was quite spacious, nicely decorated and had a sizable bathroom. The price was quite reasonable as well. Breakfast was 12 Euro a person but it was all you could eat. We did eat breakfast there a few times and the selection as well as the coffee was good. There is also a cozy little restaurant called \"Cambuse\" almost directly opposite the hotel run by a kindly middle aged gent. We tried it out one night when too tired to go further afield and the food was traditional, delicious and well priced. It is no surprise that the Jardin de L'Odeon has so much going for it.

Though the area bustles, the Jardin de l'Odeon is situated on a quiet side street--the best of both worlds. As for our room, it was comfortably sized (hard to come by in Europe), nicely appointed and featured our own private terrace with table and chairs. Of course not all the rooms had the latter; however, it might be worth asking if you decide to book here. The only drawback was that the bed was a bit hard, though no worse than other Paris hotels at which I've stayed. The service staff at the hotel was exceptional. Our room was nicely tidied each day by the housekeeping staff and the personnel at the front desk were always very polite and helpful. They even went the extra mile to loan us an adapter, a corkscrew and a couple wine glasses for the duration of our stay. Overall, staying at the Jardin de l'Odeon was a very positive experience for us, and we would most definitely consider staying here again. As a side note, if you are in the neighborhood, be sure to check out Le Comptoir--just a few blocks away--for dinner on the weekend (you'll need a reservation during the week when they do a full gastronomic tasting menu).

This would not have been the end of the world apart from the fact that the maid had taken it upon herself to throw some of our belongings away. Whilst we were packing we kept noticing things missing. First our toothbrushes, and a 3/4 full tube of toothpaste, then some plastic champagne glasses that we had bought for picnics. Not flimsy ones, but proper dishwashable picnic glasses, some of which were still in the wrapper, we left them next to the TV, and a few other assorted items. When my partner went to enquire after them it all seemed like too much bother for the maids, and they gave him the bin liner that they had thrown our stuff away in and we had to rummage through it and retreave our stuff!!!!

The hotel was perfect for our stay. We had a little business and a lot of shopping to do (she is 16 years old, nuff said). Jardin is situated in a central, safe, swanky (it seems, from the Parisians whom we told) and relatively quiet part of town, just off a quaint shopping area and close to the Seine.

The room is a little noisy if you are there while the other rooms are being cleaned but then who wants to be in during the day (only shopping-exhaustion kept us in one day). One slight comment to the staff: please be realistic about taxi travel times and fares. I booked a taxi to the bus station (for Paris Beauvais) at 18.15 and when I asked, was assured that it would not cost more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15 and there would be not traffic problem, I would be there by 18.40 latest. The taxi meter already had \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 10 when I climbed in and I had to bail out of the taxi at 19.20 with all my luggage ten minutes from the bus station to make a mad dash to the last possible bus I could catch so as not to miss my flight!!! The taxi trip cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac42 and did not even get me there! Not Jardin staff's fault of course but a little realism would help. Paris rush hour traffic is insane, as was our taxi driver who valiantly tried everything short of river-surfing to get us there on time...

It is within a 5-10 minute stroll to Rue Princesse which is a street ideal for the visiting Irish (full of pubs!). The staff were very pleasant, switching to english immediately on spotting the green jerseys (great as our french left a lot to be desired!) and what followed was a swift check-in process. The hotel is very small but in Parisien standards I'm sure it's pretty normal. The decor is fresh and modern and very cleverly done overall. They have made the best use of space and the result is an elegant hotel. There are about 6 rooms on each floor and the rooms are fairly small. Saying that, they do manage to fit in a dresser, mini-bar, chair and stool. The 2 single beds (pushed together and dressed as a double) in our room were actually shorter than a standard bed so my husbands feet did stick out the bottom considerably! I have no idea if this is the case in all rooms. The en-suite was spotlessly clean and well equipped with toiletries, but again my husbands 6 foot height became an issue in the shower as the roof is very low. Our only complaint was that on the second night the maid had removed the extra blankets from the room so I did wake with the cold and slept with my coat over me! I'm not sure why they were removed and I'm afraid I didn't question it or complain. I was just happy to get back to sleep after a long day! The breakfast was lovely with a selection of boiled eggs, cereal, breads, ham, cheese, yogurt and fruit to choose from, along with juice, tea, coffee etc served by a friendly lady happy to help.

The hotel is a very short walk to the Odeon metro station and all the sites can be accessed easily. The area around the hotel is also quiet nice to walk around. We had room 21 (classic double), which was quiet large compared to Paris standards. The room had a double/queen bed (not 2 singles pushed together as seen in other photos), which was very nice. The room was nicely decorated with tasteful wallpaper and paintings. The view from the bedroom was into the hotel's outdoor courtyard and breakfast area. Not the best view but again quiet, and in the morning you woke up to birds singing. The bathroom was also large and clean. Plenty of hot water and good pressure. The staff were excellent, spoke perfect english, and were very helpful. Also they provided us with a bottle of champagne as a New Year's gift, which was a very nice touch!! The only area in which I would say that this hotel is lacking is in the food provided. There is no restaurant or bar attached, but breakfast is provided in a cafe area. Breakfast is very expensive at 12Euros/person. Breakfast consisted of breads, cheese, coffee/teas/juice, cold cuts and fruits. However, this is not a problem as there are plenty of cafes and bakeries very close to the hotel. We had breakfast outside of the hotel everyday for much less approx. 4-8euros/person.

You can also walk to grocery stores (Champion, and basement of Monoprix) to get fruit, snacks, drinking water, etc. for consumption at your hotel room.

I would like to point out first the minuses, small though they may be. Room sizes are small, and storage for clothing can vary widely - my room had a small closet and some shelf space - no drawer space, though other rooms I did see had much more storage than my own, depending on the room layout. If you are two people sharing a room, and are \"packing heavy\", this may not be the hotel for you. However, beyond that, the rooms are quite comfortable, and are attractively decorated, with sparkling and modern bath facilities. Rooms facing the back of the hotel are very quiet - those facing the street will get some street noise, but, save for one bar down Rue Casimir Delavigne, there is little commercial activity or traffic on the road in front of the hotel. The hotel is a block away from the Odeon Metro stop at the Blvd. St. Germain, and is within easy walking distance of any number of restaurants, boutiques and entertainment venues (lots of cinemas nearby, on the Blvd. St. Germain). It is about a 15 minute stroll to the Seine, and not much further across the Pont des Arts to the Louvre. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful, and there is a small elevator, though, for descending, you may wish to opt for the stairs (I did most days, from the 3rd floor - a useful bit of exercise). I did not eat breakfast at the hotel, opting instead for breakfast at Les Editeurs in the Carrefour de l'Odeon, just before the entrance to the Metro. In the other direction, the hotel is about two blocks away from the Luxembourg RER station, which has a direct connection to both the Gare du Nord (for the Eurostar train) and Charles de Gaulle airport (8.20 euros one-way from the airport, with a large number of express trains direct from airport to Gare du Nord - Luxembourg is about four stops further south from the train station).

We were not disappointed. The room (#27) was a good size considering Paris standards, with two double beds pushed together, a TV, closet, desk and a full, recently reno'd bathroom complete with tub and shower. The room was very clean and quiet, and had excellent AC. We were there in the heart of summer and it was quite warm, but the room was perfect. The streets are perhaps a little noisy if you are not used to hustle and bustle, but if you're from a big city it is nothing to worry about. The room was cleaned every day including the weekends and was well appointed. They require you to leave your key at the front desk when you are not in your room, but this is quite typical at European hotels. Also, your key is inserted into the light switch to activate the room lighting, which took me a few minutes to figure out. There are numerous restaurants on the various streets that run right by the hotel, including a very good Indian place (Indian, Paris?). There are also several cafe's and a fantastic bistro on the corner by the Metro. It is called Le Comptoir and is a very busy but excellent place to dine. Be prepared to wait for a table though depending on what time you get there, as there was a lineup each night to get in If you are a couple or travelling alone, the hotel is fabulous. Right on the border of the Latin Quarter and St. Germain des Pres, there is a lot going on very close, shopping, food (very lose to Les Deux Maggots) and worth the stay.

It was small but immaculately decorated, very clean, nice window opening on a small flowery internal courtyard and very quiet. This was a godsend because Paris was packed with people and traffic. We are not, by nature, city people but the peace of the room, the hotel's location near the Odeon theatre and very good restaurants all in a very short distance made the hectic pace of life around St Germain and near the Seine much more bearable. The Cambuse (opposite the hotel) and Chez Maitre Paul (round the corner at Rue Monsieur Le Prince) are to be commended on their excellent food and friendly service and the Luxembourg Gardens at a short walk from the hotel were an absolute delight to the senses and a haven of relaxation. What was most impressive were the very friendy hotel staff - I have to say that I didn't encounter one unfriendly character in the whole of my three days in the city - everyone appeared to be in a good mood (especially when France beat the All Blacks), but having smiling faces on the front desk when you walk into an alien environment is a real positive for me. Breakfast was perfectly reasonable at 12 euros. My only criticism would be that with no tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms and no bar, you have to go out for a hot drink and after a particularly unpleasant fall, having got back to the hotel, I really needed a hot cup of tea to steady my nerves and my husband had to go to the nearest snack bar to get one and bring it back.

Reviewer: widowed female traveller from Boston area. I stayed at the Hotel Jardin de L'Odeon for eight nights in May 2007. My room appeared to have been recently renovated and was attractive and comfortable although it was the typically small Paris hotel room (I have stayed in smaller Paris hotel rooms). The bathroom (with tub) was a good size, immaculate, and furnished with modern fixtures. The staff were very friendly and helpful in booking both bus tours and a very reasonable shuttle to the airport. I wish I could remember the name of the woman who made my bookings (Stephanie?). I know she dealt with numerous hotel guests everyday, but she even remembered my booking for Versailles when I passed her on the sidewalk as she was leaving work for the day. She asked me how I had enjoyed it, and I was impressed by her kindness. All in all, this is a very nice place to stay if you are looking for something both well-located and reasonable in price (not so easy to find these days with the weak dollar versus the euro). The breakfast buffet at 12 euros may seem pricey, but you get a lot for your money (cold meats, cheeses, fresh fruit, juices, croissants, rolls, refills if you want on the hot beverage of choice). You would spend a lot more than 12 euros for all this at a Paris cafe. The hotel also offers a selection of complimentary newspapers to its guests; a nice touch in such a reasonably priced hotel.", "Date": "June 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cPerfect!\u201d", "Author": "SHM_MLCD", "ReviewID": "UR7725042", "Content": "This hotel is a great find!

The room is typically smallish, but is nicely decorated. The bed is pretty comfortable, and the sheets are clean. Bathroom is clean as well. The location is nice, but then again, Paris is pretty compact so it's hard to find a hotel that is not \"close to everything\". I do love the 6'eme arrondisement as they have all these great little bookstores on every little street. It's also not as touristy as other arr's. It is located on a street that you would think is quiet, but I do not consider that to be the case. Every night I could hear people (we were on the 5th floor) walking pass our hotel, obviously walking home drunk. 2 out of the 3 nights the loud people passing by were done by about 1am, but one night I was woken up around 4am from someone on the streets. If you don't mind sleeping with the window shut, you'll probably be fine. I do prefer to have fresh air in the room so I'd like to leave a crack. But then again, all this is not the hotel's fault. Yes, when we were there the construction was happening. It usually starts about 8am. I guess it's not necessarily a bad thing since it kind of forces you to get up and start the day early. Did not have breakfast at the hotel as it's pretty expensive. There are so many cafes in Paris for breakfast, why eat at the hotel?? Got a recommendation from the front desk, Resturant Christine, which was great. It's not necessarily cheap, but the food is great.

Here are some general comments about the location, rooms, bathrooms, facilities, etc. 1) The most fantastic thing about the hotel was its location. The hotel is on an extremely quiet street but in a very convenient location. It's about 1 block from the street St. Germain in the heart of St. Germain de pres, 1/2 a block from the Odeon theater (which we could see from our window), maybe 1 1/2 blocks from the Jardin du Luxembourg and the Luxembourg Palace, and a very close distance to an RER station and a metro station. There were excellent restaurants all around. You can walk to virtually any tourist site in Paris. Notre Dame is a short walk. We also walked to the Louvre, Musee d'Orsay, Montparnasse, Champs Elysee, everywhere. Shopping at St. Germain de Pres, with all the designer boutiques mixed in with cute and unique shops of all kinds was amaizng. 2) The hotel rooms were small but not cramped, and well-designed (our room had a desk tucked into a corner, a small hallway to the bathroom, a decent-sized closet where we tucked in our suitcases, and large French windows that made the room seem more spacious). They were recently remodeled and very clean. We did not feel crowded after 8 days, and the room was well-taken care of during our stay. 3) The bathroom was virtually new, with an excellent shower (our room had a nice deep tub but some rooms had only showers), large white tiles. 4) For people who care, there was shampoo, bath/shower gel, shower cap, mending kit, and soap in the room; there were ironing facilities in the basement and you could send out your laundry if you wanted to pay 4 euros to get underwear washed, and a steep 32 euros for an evening dress :). 5) The lobby was lovely, the breakfast room was nice with a small sunroom (2 tables). The courtyard looks beautiful in the pictures and IS lovely, but very small (2-3 small tables). 6) Breakfast was nice, and included croissants (quite delicious), bread, orange and grapefruit juice, coffee (kind of lame), tea, hot milk, cereal, pain de chocolat (I gained weight), sliced meats (excellent quality), yoghurt (very delicious), cheeses (also very good). If it comes with your room, it is fine. If not, 12 euros is steep given that you could get a full hot breakfast for that price virtually anywhere around, and pastries and such for amazingly cheap all over. 7) Of restaurants nearby, we ate at Polidor (a well-known historical brasserie) which was pretty good but not amazing, Le Petite Hostellerie (not very good but cheap), lots of small sandwich shops and creperies, Le Canton (a Chinese restaurant which was pretty good), and Indonesia (good appetizers and dessert but the main course wasn't so great). Still, Le Canton and Indonesia were excellent deals. We ate at one fancy seafood place that was EXCELLENT near Montparnasse called La Cagouille which had a pretty decent fixed price menu (but with wine our dinner for 2 was about 85 Euros, not cheap certainly but actually a good price for the several courses of amazing food). 8) Hotel employees were uniformly helpful, and all spoke English well. 9) We paid $103 Euros a night for our room including breakfast for 2.", "Date": "August 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cAwesome, immaculate and contemporary hotel\u201d", "Author": "holagente", "ReviewID": "UR5554998", "Content": "What a fabulous hotel!

I wouldn't have stayed there for the rack rate (190 Euro for our room). I knew we would have the worst room in the place because of the low price they gave us, but it was still wonderful. A tiny room, but large enough, and luxurious, with small (French) but comfortable beds, spotlessly clean, with a miniature bathroom (also spotlessly clean). Wonderful staff, unbeatable location. But 12 Euros for breakfast... are you insane???? I don't think so. Hit one of the snack bars at Odeon for take-out coffee (please, no Starbucks, this is Paris people) and the fabulous bakery a few blocks downhill for awesome croissants, pain au chocolat, etc. Also -- heed the other commenters' warnings about the noise. The walls are covered with fabric, but it is still loud in there. I will definitely return for the same price!! Otherwise, I'll check out another of the 3 dozen 3-star hotels in the quartier!

My husband and I spent 8 nights here in March 2006. I agree with much of the positive feedback. The hotel is extremely very well located, staff is polite and will speak English, and the room and bathroom were spotless. It was almost a perfect find. There is a small elevator that can hold two normal sized adults with bags. Our room was on the first floor (second american). The hall was tiny - you would not be able to extend both hands at all. It would only be a problem if you were very overweight. The lobby was very nice and the staff were helpful when asked. They called a taxi for us and made us reservations as well. They nicely tolerated my terrible tourist french. They ask that you leave the key at the desk when you leave. This is one of those keys that you slide into a slot in the room and it turns on the electricity. Common in Paris and not an incovenience. They are at the desk all the time so its not a problem. Our room (#16) was a double and small but probably typical for Paris. There was a little alcove at the beginning of the room that had a table and a useful closet. We had received an unbelievably favorable rate of 120 euro/nite on venere. There rates are usually much higher than that and I would be reluctant to pay more for a few reasons: I found the bed to be torturous. The mattress was about 6 inches thick with no padding and extremely uncomfortable. I woke up with red spots on my shoulders and hips everymorning and terrible back pain. When standing next to the bed, it didnt even reach my knees which shows how thin it was. My whole body was sore for the week. Additionally, the towels and sheets were very rough. Even my non-picky husband notices his skin was all irritated from the sheets. Like too much bleach or starch. The blanket thing was weird. When we first obtained the room, there was a quilted cover on the bed that looked like a placemat for a bed. That disappeared after the first day. The blanket consisted of a fairly think blanket between two scratchy sheets. Oh how I longed for a quilted blanket or a soft blanket. Thankfully, the pillows (4) were very comfortable. It was not as quiet as I prefer. The double pane windows did a good job when closed from most street noise at night. However, only the suites are air conditioned so if you stayed in the summer and needed to open the windows, you lose the benefit of the windows. I could hear the TV of my neighbor through the wall, water running in the pipes, and the slam of every door. The maids get going around 9 am and its really noisy. If you bring a white noise machine, it might help. The bathroom was large and all tiled with white ceramic tile. It was spotlessly cleaned every day. We had a tub with a mounted shower and one of those half glass shower doors. The floor still got wet despite this. There was a fairly good hairdryer but it didnt reach the mirror so you kind of had to bob back and forth to see how you were doing. There was no plug in the bathroom for a shaver or hairdryer. Sorry to say, i would not stay again mostly due to the discomfort of the room. Its a shame because there were so many nice things about the place but the lack of a comfortable cushy place to sleep was a big drawback. I would have been really disappointed had I paid more. Lastly, the best pictures of this hotel are found at Parisby.

My decision was based on reviews from this website. Jardin de L'Odeon is located on a quiet street in the 6th, just a few minute walk from Blvd. St. Germain and the Odeon metro station. This hotel is also just a block away from the lovely Jardin du Luxembourg. There are many restaurants, movie theatres and shops in the area. Prior to arrival I had many email conversations with Alexandre which were both helpful and friendly. I was assured that all my requests would be taken care of and they were. Everyone from the desk staff, to the housekeepers, and the breakfast servers were pleasant, professional and efficient. I stayed in room 41, which overlooked the small courtyard and was next to the elevator. The room was small, but I expected as much, especially since I was travelling alone. 2 people could have stayed somewhat comfortably, but cramped in the double bed. Although tiny, the room was immaculately clean, with pleasant decor. The bathroom was a good size with a wonderful, deep tub for soaking, as well as a shower. Behind the door was a small desk, equipped with a directory of services and letterhead/envelopes from the hotel. The room also included a good sized wardrobe for hanging clothes, with shelves, a safe and a mini-bar. I did not notice much noise the first few nights of my stay, which may have been due to the hotel not being fully booked or my being tired and jet-lagged, but on Friday and Saturday nights, there was some noise from guests returning late in the night. Even though I was in a room next to the elevator, I was not disturbed by it. Although the posted rate in the room was 195 euro, I paid substanially less than that amount by booking through Expedia. I do believe 195 euro was a bit high for this hotel. The hotel breakfast is 12 euro and was not included in my rate. It was substanital and delicious. Guests could choose to either eat in the breakfast room overlooking the lobby and courtyard, or order up to their room.

This hotel is close to the main strip in Saint Germain. It is in a good location and close to restaurants and the metro. However, there are a number of 3 star hotels similar to this one (three next door) that would be better value for money. The walls were paper thin and you could hear everything - the elevator doors opening and closing, people talking in adjoining rooms, doors slamming. The room was way too hot and being unable to change the temperature and getting no help from the front desk, we resorted to opening the windows during the middle of winter. Our room had orange and red striped wall paper and if that isn't enough to make you run in the other direction, then this actual size of the room including the bathroom should. We had to stand in the shower to dry ourselves. The room was tiny - we had double beds that touched because there was literally no room around them. Everytime we left the building we had to hand in our room key to the manager on duty. I also had a problem with one of the managers - who was incredibly rude over a tour that I had booked. I felt it unneccesary for him to have behaved this way- not only to myself, but to the tour operator who collected me from the hotel.
