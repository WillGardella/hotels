It is just off a busy street with some noise. The staff seem friendly, but the manager seemed upset when my 14 year old son want to go on the computer to check emails.

We booked over the phone from Vegas and got quoted a price of around US$90 per night in a standard double room and trusted the lady at the front desk regarding how good the value was. When we arrived we noticed a large sign board stating the price was US$45 per night! When i asked them to refund the difference they said they wouldnt and nor could they provide a refund. The sign was also removed very quickly. Anyway, we realised we had to settle for this motel since they were not going to refund us at all. We were then put in a room on the street. Extremely noisy, but we dealt with it. The next morning our toilet was severly blocked and we couldnt use it. Asked reception for help which took a good 45 mins. Asked to change rooms to move away from the street. They said they were full. Then I asked to see the manager and all of a sudden, a room was now available off the street! Rooms - small, dark and musty. Very noisy if facing the road. They were however, reasonably clean. Service - the brochure promises 'San Dieogos' friendliest service. Wrong! Unhelpful, and generally lazy. Location - Point Loma is a good location, however, being on one of San Diego's main roads is not! Stay away. You'll definitely be dissappointed.", "Date": "July 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix AZ", "Title": "\u201cpositives & negatives\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5443854", "Content": "A friend and I stayed at the Loma Lodge over July 4th weekend for 4 nites. Overall the place was nice and the staff was OK -- nothing really wowed me. Some things underwhelmed me. We booked a king suite (I don't honestly remember the exact terminology of how they call the room). It was a king sized bed in the main room and then a doorway into a converted triangular closet that had a single bed, another TV and 2 chairs and a small table inside. The room was just OK from a cleanliness standpoint. My socks got REALLY dirty from walking on the carpeted floor, and the shower had some cracked tiles and mildew inside. The bathroom appeared mostly clean on the surface but if you looked you could see that it needed some superior sanitizing. The shower itself was full-sized, but had the worst water pressure and temp control. I had to run the cold water in the sink while showering to get hot water to come out of the shower head. The TV rec'd about 10 local/basic cable channels (and Carton Network w/out sound -- odd). There was a mini-fridge in the room but it was unplugged (which I didn't realize until I found my leftovers rotting the next day). The amenities were scare (no iron, no coffee maker, no hair dryer) and the AC took about 4 hours before the room started to cool down. Granted, it was an unseasonably hot (95 degrees one day & very humid) and most of the locals were complaining about the temps, however we engaged in a battle with the cleaning staff to leave the AC on in our room Each evening when we returned the AC was off and the room had heated back up to unbearable temperatures. Therefore, we ending up sharing the king sized bed underneath the AC unit and used the closet of a second room solely as a dressing area (the closet room had no AC). The walls very very thin. I don't think there was anyone in the room next to us, but we could hear people across the hall and anyone walking thru the hallway as if they were in our room (probably due to the 1\u00c2\u00bd gap underneath the door. Each evening there were flyers just inside the door for a local pizza/wings joint, but there was a cryptic security warning on cut up pieces of scrap paper from the front desk advising not to order from flyers stuffed under the door (with no explanation as to why). We hauled our bags up to the second floor which wasn't too bad for two middle-aged guys, but would not have been possible if I had my wheelchair bound grandmother with me. On the positive side, the desk staff was friendly and the housekeeping staff was very polite and responsive (if not aggressive). The Loma Lodge is located in a residential/light commercial district with plenty of amenities(drug store, supermarket, fast food & gas) nearby. Parking was cramped, but free. We parked 2 times on the street in the cute residential neighborhood behind the lodge w/out incident. A bus line runs in front of the lodge and taxis are supposedly available as well. (The front desk called us a taxi twice on Friday nite and we waited for over an hour and it never arrived, although I can't hold the front desk responsible for that). The pool area looked nice and clean, but we did not use it. The lodge is close to Sea World by car, as well as the I-5 and the PCH, so it's easy to get around by car. The Loma Lodge has some quaint attributes that harken back to the days of the mid-century motor lodge and boasts a great vintage sign out front. The facade, tilework and public areas are nice, but not indicative of the interior of the room we rented. We paid $109 for 3 nites and $129 for one nite.", "Date": "July 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cI love this place\u201d", "Author": "NationalGeographic1", "ReviewID": "UR3430575", "Content": "Great service, great price and clean rooms.
