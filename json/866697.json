The hotel is very convenient to the highway (Interstate 17). Took us about 25 minutes without traffic to get from the airport car rental place to the hotel (get off on Exit 218).

There is an attached Marriott Courtyard with a bar if you need a beer, although the managers reception (Mon to Wed) has a selection of beers and wine.

The only complaint I have about this hotel is that all the 2 bedroom suites are located directly above the sports center (tennis courts, basketball court) and people are allowed to use this area until 11 p.m. What happens is that teenagers use it as a skateboard park and gathering place so we heard loud voices, yelling, loud laughter, basketball games and tennis matches up until 11 o.m. every night. The staff tries their hardest to keep the noise down, but there are people using this sports court at night who are not staying there - people who have just jumped the fence to use the pool, the covered tables and the sports court, so it is hard for the staff to man the front desk and keep track of what is going on in the courtyard. It would be better if they kept the sports court open until 7 p.m. and then closed it.

Staff were friendly. We stayed in a one-bedroom suite, finished to a high quality. The kitchen was well-equipped with all the necessaries- fridge, hob, oven, microwave, delph etc. and must not forget the dishwasher! The bed was very comfortable, with crisp clean linens. There was a second television in the bedroom. The bathroom had a separate vanity area with a second closet. You also won\u2019t need to bring an iron or hairdryer with you as they are provided.

Just make note that this hotel is located outside of Phoenix, making it some distance from Phoenix\u2019s main attractions. However, it\u2019s convenient to access I 17 and 101. There is a shopping mall very close by with restaurants, a cinema and shops. I didn\u2019t know this until I arrived but the hotel will do grocery shopping for you and have it in for when you arrive. I think this is a great facility. A Wal-Mart is close by if you fancy doing your own shop. There is also a gym, which seemed well equipped, I just looked not used! However, I did use the self-service laundry room. You need you\u2019re room key to access it. It has 3 or 4 washing machines and about the same number of dryers. It costs $1 and detergent is available from reception at no extra charge. And speaking of charges, there were none for the bottled water left in the room or for wireless internet access.
