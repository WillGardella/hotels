I already expected to walk up five flights of stairs to my room before I came here (no elevators). It was a minor inconvenience for me since I'm still a young guy, but the stairs are really steep just to let you all know. For someone with a lot of heavy luggage, I wouldn't even consider this place. Shared bathrooms were not clean and was not stocked with toiletries (toilet paper, soap, etc). For some reason the whole toilet paper roll was wet but still in the holder. My folded blanket still had pieces of hair in it, therefore it was probably not even washed and just refolded. They leave you some a basic bar of soap, disposable toothbrush and little toothpaste packet as their last and only attempt at hospitality. The place needs air freshener, stunk of body odor. I expected as much since as you can read from the other reviews, so many bodies close together and the rooms aren't exactly closed, the ceilings of the closet sized rooms are closed off by some type of metal chicken coop wire. Didn't see any cockroaches thank God, I guess they fixed that problem. I did smell an amalgam of pungent odors as I walked up to my floor. A mix of cat excrement and body odor from what I could figure out... I saw at least two naked chinese tenants walking around the 3rd and 4th floors. Goody.... Staff did their basic duties to get you a key, assign room, but basically they were just bodies.. not so much as one greeting as I arrived or thank you as we left. A vending machine would do a better job in their place. Paid total of $55 for one night, stayed her the night of New Years Eve. Probably cheaper on non-holidays. But still... too much for this place. My first night at a hostel. My friend who I stayed with here has had an extensive experience with hostels and said this was the worst one he's been in. ..Terrific. To be honest I slept like a baby, I guess it was my desire to block out all the unpleasantness I was experiencing at this hostel. My friend on the other hand, had trouble sleeping because he was next to some loud snorers and one british dude that was talking loudly on the phone until 4 am. Again, you will hear everything from the other rooms. The walls are just their visual privacy. The only good things I can say? Well you have your own private dorm with a white light lamp and.. there's a decent bed... At least I'm happy to know they're not all like this.

I had to book a room at short notice for my stay in New York and this was the cheapest option by far in the Manhattan area. I stayed there for 2 weeks. Any longer then I would have paid the extra to get a 'normal' hotel. Anyhow the room was on the fifth floor and there are no elevators so I recommend traveling lightly. Floors 3 and 4 are for permanent residents and it shows, they live in quite dismal conditions and almost make the guest floors look like a luxury residence. The room itself is tiny with no ceiling other than chicken gauze/wire. No sink/mirror and only a very basic area to store your belongings...you have to be creative in order not to for the area not to get too untidy. So given the room structure and dimensions you need to bring ear plugs and an eye mask since you can hear every movement of the people on the floor. They do not turn off the lights at night , that is the reason for the eye mask . There were 5 shower/restroom facilities on the floor and I never had to wait to get in one and there was always hot water. Bring flip flops so that you use these areas hygienically. That is all there is to this place. For the money it is well located, but if you are a light sleeper then you will have a hard time resting. It is only a place to come back to after you have spent the whole day sightseeing so it does encourage you to spend time outside of the hotel since there is nothing to do inside the place itself. Would I go there again? Only if my back was against the wall and my options were very limited. I was in an unusual situation given the short amount of time that I had to book the flight and hotel and also the amount of time that I needed to spend in NYC. The next cheapest option in Manhattan was about 3 times as expensive, so given my circumstances I am actually quite grateful that the Sunbright hotel was there to fill an unusual requirement for me. On a 'normal' vacation for me which would last a week I would not consider it. It is for single people only not for a family.

You still however are only a wooden wall away from your neighbors. On all 3 sides. There is no roof on your bunk, only chicken gauze.

It looked like a chiken coup. There were scores of tiny 'bedrooms' placed next to one another in a pen-like fashion. Upon opening the door to my room I was surprised again at how small the space was. It is literally enough space for a small single mattress with enough walkway to shuffle down one side of the bed. Having overcome the initial shock I actually realised that this, at the price of a budget hostel actually offers significantly more privacy. The space is tiny but at least its 'your space'. The rooms are very clean and the mattress comfortable. There are two plug sockets and your own light switch. Those are the plus points. Unfortunately there is no ceiling to the rooms, in fact it is a sheet of chicken wire, presumably to stop people snooping into the next room. This also means that at no point during the day or night is it ever remotely dark. The hallway lights are on all night and therefore an eye mask and ear plugs are a must!

This hotel was all I could afford before moving to another part of the USA. The price is a rip off, I stayed in a double bed room, and could not fit my suitcase in (it slept on the bed with me). I had a fight with the light switch everytime I went in and me and a couple of cockroaches became very good mates by the second night. The walls are paper thin and mine were covered in some green substance. You can definetly hear everything going on in the surrounding rooms. The staff were rude, and you could not approach them about finding things like the subway or even how to get some where. The Sun Bright is a shared bath, you need to take your own towel if you do decide to stay here. They provide a towel, mine had obvious stains on it before I even unfolded it. The bathrooms, are dirty, disgusting, flood quite easily, and really arent cleaned properly every day. Take your own sheets, I ended up sleeping on my towel and used a jacket for a blanket. I would not recommend this hotel for any one.", "Date": "January 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alfred, New York", "Title": "\u201cPoor\u201d", "Author": "ac1234", "ReviewID": "UR21506235", "Content": "Upon arriving at the 'hotel' the windowless room was dirty, the bed sheets werent changed and there were stains everywhere.

Also in the room there was a sink and a tv. There was no common room for everyone to hang out. The vending machines were either nearly empty or didnt work. Because there are men who stay in the hotel permanently we had to be buzzed through a secure door to get into the 'hotel' part of the building.
