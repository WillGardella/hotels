Surely they can use cleaning products that can just make the place smell a bit nicer? I hope the housekeeper puts some pressure on management about this. Secondly, when people write the rooms are small they are actually diplomatic. I have not experienced such small spaces anywhere.

The business centre consists of a computer in the concierge desk, where you will sit in public and try and do your critical business emails - while other guests think you are an employee there.

I actually found it on booking.com 6 days before traveling for around $1k for 5 nights, which, given the location didn't think was too bad at all. Due to the massive snowstorm on the Saturday night over NYC, myself and my girlfriend were very late arriving in from Europe and I feared my room might be released as happens quite frequently with some hotels. A quick call to the hotel whilst being diverted to a different airport put paid to any fears. The receptionist found my booking straight away, was very polite and relaxed about the whole thing. She was still on duty 6hrs later when we arrived, remembered the conversation and was so nice to us both. Very efficient speedy service and no more than 6/7mins we were in the room unpacking. Hotel Some would regard this place as a \"boutique\" hotel, and I would be inclined to agree. Hilton, Marriott, Intercontinental this aint. If that's what you want, then you're looking at the wrong place. Service/Staff Absolutely faultless; very quick; very attentive; no pretensions; no fuss. Location Absolutely perfect if you're ambulatory. 30secs to Broadway; 5mins walk south to Times Square; 5mins north to Central Park; 5 good restaurants, the furthest being no more than 10mins and 3 blocks away; 20secs to a subway station to the Business District. Room I chose a \"King Room\" and the room faced onto the back of other buildings. My initial thought was \"oh damn, no view\", but that changed quickly to \"Ah, at least no traffic noise\". The rooms are on the small side, but that's about par for the course for Manhattan and if you want more, then be prepared to dig deeper into the pocket. The only downside of the room was that for the size, a King-size bed, was just a little too big for the room and it felt a little cramped and the bathroom was pretty small. But, if you've come to do the sights and the shopping, do you really want a gigantic room? However, the plus side is the bed was bang on. I spend 45/50% of my working time traveling and in hotels and I can say for sure it was THE comfiest beds I've ever had in a hotel...by a long way.

The confirmation through United showed October but the idiots that run this place put it into their computer for December and proceeded to tell us that they couldn't do anything about it. We finally got United to straighten this out and we lost a day of NY because of their incompetency. Check in was a pain as the staff was aloof and pretentious. They gave us a room on the first floor and I requested to be on a floor that wasn't so noisy.

(It was 6:00 a.m. so I don't think they could have run out of water) and there was no iron and ironing board in the room. My colleague who had an adjacent room was able to get a hot shower however another guest checking out was also complaining he couldn't get a hot shower.

The hotel is brand-spanking new and is not displeasing to the eye, but it already has a good deal of scuffing on the pretty wallpaper (who puts up wallpaper in a hallway without adding protective screens?), I got to my room and the interior was as if made out of leftover Barbarella materials. Chain mail, metallic linen and wallpaper surfaces with a hint of Purple Rain lighting didn't exactly scream luxury, but hey, everybody's tastes is different. It looked like the workmen had been scrambling to get the job done on time, because the finishings were not so perfect. Scuffs, broken tiles and crooked joints. Another nifty design feature is the cupboard with the porthole that has a bright light inside it that is impossible to turn off. In an attempt to switch it off, I inadvertently woke up my husband with the main lights going on and off. The solution to the problem? Yank out the cord. If you are out to party and not actually there to sleep, it may very well be a lovely place to hang out. In my case, I was there to sleep, so my experience was rather disappointing. At midnight, I called down to the reception as our bed was vibrating (and not in a good way). The gentleman at the front desk quipped \"what can i help you with SIR?\". I can appreciate his manners, but no one has never told me my voice sounds like a man's. I complained about the noise, and remarked that I was indeed, a WOMAN. His excuse was that I had come up as Mr. on his screen. Are people so used to trust whatever is on a screen in front of them that they forget they have ears?!?. In response to the noise complaint, he told me he would tell the DJ to lower the base. One our later, the base was still on at full strength and we called down again. This time, we were offered a new room. After getting up in the middle of the night, we were moved to a different room. When asked if anyone else on floor 11 had complained, our escort told me he did nothing but move people from that floor all night and that 1106 was DIRECTLY BELOW the DJ booth. We were moved to a room on the 8th floor which was if possible, even smaller than our last. The slanting walls with the straight curtains did nothing to help that impression but we were too tired to care at that point.

This is my second stay at this hotel, the first being on an Aruba/NYC trip back in August 2008. My friend and I arrived very early on the JetBlue redeye and we were pretty sure our room wouldn't be ready upon arrival. So we dropped off our luggage at the hotel and hit the streets for a bit. Ideally located where all the action is (Broadway/Times Square just south, Central Park a couple blocks to the north, and high end shopping and great restaurants to the east, and most important: nearby subway access!), the Dream Hotel serves as an excellent home base to explore Manhattan. It was my friend's first time at the Dream Hotel, and he felt the room was very good in size and price by NYC standards, with a clean and modern look. They still have the blue accent lighting under the bed and inside the glass top desk. If you are staying in a room for one then its quite a bit smaller. Internet access in the rooms is sorta pricey, but it was reasonably fast. Wifi is available free in the lobby. I am an exercise fanatic and the gym at the hotel is extremely small and basic, but you can go to the front desk and get a pass to Gold's Gym right around two corners from the hotel and work out at a top notch facility. I exercise diligently and this is a fantastic and convenient arrangement with Gold's Gym and the Dream Hotel. The top floors of the hotel house a bar/nightclub that can get pretty loud on weekends. You may see a line of well dressed twentysomethings snaking out the door late Friday and Saturday night. On my visit in 2008 hotel guests were able to go to the bar at any time. Now the arrangement is different, and guests have to wait in line in the lobby with everybody else on busy nights. As mentioned, the Dream Hotel is located in the center of it all, and we did a lot: Central Park Zoo, Museum of Natural History/Rose Center for Space(looking back we should have done to the Guggenheim), taping of the David Letterman show at the Ed Sullivan Theater right across the street form the hotel, rented bikes and rode thru Central Park, east to the Hudson River and all the way down to Battery Park(where we experienced a rare east coast earthquake), then back uptown via 6th Street amongst all the taxis(exciting!). With the metro station so close to the hotel we went about town and saw the Highline Park, antique markets in the Chelsea District, and the New York by Gehry building. Tips for staying at the Dream Hotel: Take the Airtrain from JFK to the E Line(Sutphin Blvd.) and then the E Line east to the 7th Avenue Station. The hotel is just two short blocks away. Total cost should be around $7-8 for both the Airtrain and E Line together. We were unable to take the subway back to JFK because they were closing it down in preparation for an oncoming hurricane. If you take the taxi back to JFK, it says right on the taxi door that the fare to the airport is $45 plus possibly another $5 for a bridge toll. The Park Cafe(861 7th Avenue) just down the street southeast from the hotel and kitty corner. A one minute walk (if that), good food and great prices. We went there twice! Both times were timed right and we were seated quickly, and when we left there were long lines for a table. The best deal in town! If you want to get ripped off, go to Benash Delicatessen across the street from the Park Cafe. $16 for three eggs. There is a reason they don't post their menu on the street for passers-by to look at. I will be visiting NYC/Manhattan again someday for more exploration of a great city. When I do, I will be staying at the Dream Hotel again.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cAmazing stay!\u201d", "Author": "Stacey H", "ReviewID": "UR118651920", "Content": "The staff was soooo helpful!

Speaking of which, we hosted a small gathering of friends at Ava on the Friday we were there and had a great time. The lounge has an exceptional view of Broadway/Times Sq (looks directly onto the Ed Sullivan Theater where Letterman tapes) and even more exceptional cocktails! We also ate (a few times!) in Serafina, the Italian restaurant just off the hotel lobby. The food was excellent and fairly reasonable for the area. Highly recommend!

Other than that, my only complaint would be the staff...The hotel has a very nice roof-top bar/lounge, but because it was a Sat night (I guess?), it was packed and the people working were not pleasant or helpful. Being a guest of the hotel, you would think you would get priority access, but that wasn't the case. We took the elevator up to the lounge and were told to go back down to the lobby and have our ID's checked, and wait in line. Then, once we finally got up to the lounge, they were not allowing anyone else to go up to the rooftop - the whole scene was just too forced and unfair. Maybe during the week it is not like this, but it was definitley a turnoff. We also requested a DVD player in our room and didn't recieve one.

This is probably also not a hotel for a romantic weekend in New York. This is a hotel for friends having fun in the city, and who would like to go dancing at a hot club. The scene: The hotel has a club in their basement that pumps loud salsa music on Saturday nights. I actually would've loved to go dancing if my friends were there that night. It's right in Times Square, which means easy access to the subways and almost any type of entertainment. In addition the hotel is outfitted with these neon blue lights and \"modern/chic\" images of naked women holding their breasts and a large eye, that type of thing. You will hear the noises from the visitors in adjacent rooms. They'll probably be laughing hysterically, or you know.... They also have a penthouse club that is very popular. Overall Experience: Stay here if you don't mind the party. The rooms are secure and pretty clean. They are tiny, of course, but it's New York City. The bed is comfortable and you won't be bothered. Definitely stay here if you're looking for a fun time with your friends who like to party. Other: You have to pay for the wifi which I feel is a joke given that even the Hampton Inn gives you free wireless. Also the elevator can take a long time, so be patient.

I stayed for one night and chose to leave ahead of schedule in the morning so I could shower at home instead of at this hotel. Hotels should be comfortable escapes from home, and this was the opposite. The walls, doors and light switches were all very visibly dirty. The most annoying thing was the toilet. It basically made a slow trickle noise the entire time I was in my room, and every 20 minutes it would make a loud noise (maybe because a neighbor flushed? who knows). Definitely needed maintenance but I was too tired to move rooms or complain because of it. I also did not enjoy hearing the alarm of the person in the next room. Very thin walls! All I have to say is thank God I was only in the room for 7 hours (including sleep time).

She is a friend of mine and has stayed here and assured me it was an amazing hotel. I understand that space is hard to come by in the Big Apple so we expected small rooms for a hefty price. The location of Dream hotel (mid manhattan) is amazing and made it so easy to get around NYC. We had some fabulous resturants and attractions nearby and hells kitchen was approx 8 minute walk away. We didn't order room service at Dream- there's so many fantastic places to eat in NYC its almost criminal to do this!! On arrival the door staff were very helpful and the lobby looks modern and funky. There is a novel feature in the lobby too! Unfortunately the staff at the front desk were uninterested in checking us in. Lucky we had the lobby feature to stare at while we waited. When they did get around to checking us in, the woman at the front desk was indifferent, bordering on unfriendly. She was like this throughout our whole stay. We were booked in the cheapest room type. Our room was well appointed, well maintained, clean, and as expected very small. I personally did not like the layout and style, I felt they were trying a bit too hard to be modern and edgy without pulling it off and wasting valuable space in the process. Again this is personal taste but the blue light under the bed and in the writing desk reminded my of public toilets in dodgey places, luckily we finally found the switch and turned them all off! The Dream has a small enclosed roof top bar where we had a couple of drinks. The view is great. We also had a drink in the bar on the street, which is nice. Again staff were not interested in us, but we stayed for one drink. On the second day a friendly staff member mentioned they only had 50% occupancy. I plucked up the courage to ask the front desk lady for an upgrade. She said they could upgrade us for an extra $60 per night to a King bed room. I asked to look first. One of the staff showed us the room. It was perhaps 1m wider than our room. We decided not to bother. The front desk staff really let this place down.

So it was booked as such. Befor we left I confirmed our flight (on time) and our hotel (Dream). The hotel staff told me I was booked into a single room with a queen bed. One bed !!! I requested to be moved but was told they were booked. No problem just give me a cott (small fold out bed). She said they don't have any. What ? I tryed to get into another hotel but my agent said I would have to pay for that hotel ALSO. So I knew I would have to sleep on the floor. We arrived at the airport to find our flight delayed and we would not make our connection to Newark so we were diverted to Seatle then Newark. We made it to Newark and hopped on the bus then train and then walked 13 blocks to our hotel. A hint here...take the shuttle its only $19 one way. We checken in. The staff was friendly. Our roon was on the first floor facing 7th ave so it was busy but the room was very quiet. easy to fall asleep. My daughter said the bed was nice to sleep on. But I was on the floor. I used 4 comforters and a blanket and slept well. Our room was small. As was the bath room. The upside was it was very clean ! The room service staff was great as was the reception desk. The hotel is a very short walk to the south end of Central Park and Broadway. The subway is near the corner of the hotel and will take you every place. You must go to Carnagies Deli just around the corner. Order the pastromi on rye. The sandwitch had a half pound of pastromi on it and tasted great !!! Lots of shopping. If you want a \"I love NY\" t-shirt you can get them for $3 each. I did see them as low as 12 for $25. Dont buy at the airport they want 2 for $20. Overall the hotel is not a 4 star but a solid 3 star. They give it the extra star for location. With that said the hotel was clean, quiet, centally located, friendly staff, and not over priced.

Third, the quality of the rooms is terrific - I stayed in two different rooms on a 4 night stay. They are very clean, painted brilliant white, with brushed steel and dark-wood furnishing, and a clever minimalist design that is pleasant, fun and perfect for business or pleasure. The rooms are no smaller than any other Manhattan hotel and the little amenities - Bose stereo, safe, lighted magnifying mirror on a swivel arm in the bathroom, incredibly comfortable bed, and the upscale toiletries - all make this hotel really terrific. The staff - even the maintenance guy I met in the elevator - are all very friendly, professional and sincere.

Turns out - we didn't hear a thing - other than a garbage truck one morning. The room was very quiet, however if any staff are reading this - room 109 has a very big running toilet problem - after flushing, it just keeps going....and going.... The beds are very comfortable - and we were tired every day after a long day of sightseeing and walking - so we surprised ourselves by our ability to adapt to the small bed. The rooms are tiny - but we were rarely there, so that didn't matter. We did not ask to have our towels cleaned every day - but they did them anyway. The location is outstanding - out of the crowded, tacky, over priced Times Square area by only a few blocks - very close to Central Park, Columbas Circle and the Carnegie Deli. We ate dinner at the Serafina twice and enjoyed it immensely. Our 5 night experience was positive afterall.", "Date": "August 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cJust OK for couples\u201d", "Author": "kmkm", "ReviewID": "UR37975852", "Content": "We had booked on Hotwire (which we will never do again), we didn't know we were booking a \"boutique\" hotel.

The concierge was pleasant, but could not accomodate us, as the printers were not working at all, and the technician was working on the problem. I thought this was very odd, for a hotel of this class to not be able to accomodate this request. The lobby is not impressive and the staff was the same.

I didn't end up doing that but got there at 2:30 and was able to check in then. I had leis shipped for a graduation I was attending and they were delivered before I arrived. I asked if there was a refrigerator I could use overnight. The woman at the desk said there was a minibar in the room, and that they could empty that for me so I could have room for the leis. I thought that was great. The room was very small. It was fine for just me but If my husband were with me, it would have been too small. The bed was a full size, there was a dresser with two drawers and a small refrigerator, a closet (with iron and ironing board), and a small desk with an outlet on top! Loved that convenience. The bathroom was also small (maybe tiny!) with a half tub. The TV is a flat screen mounted to the wall. There was about 24 inches between the end of the bed and the wall. I peeked in a few other rooms in passing and I'm pretty confident mine was the smallest. The bed is tall enough that I was able to slide my suitcase under it to save space. There was no view, just a building. There was a privacy blind that did bring in some natural light. I think the lighting was a bit dark. The bathroom had a magnified mirror but still, the light wasn't very good. The bed was heaven. That alone will make be go back! It had a feather top pad and fluffy pillows with a soft comforter. Loved it!! Service was outstanding! I forgot toothpaste and they brought some up right away. I started my period early and wasn't prepared. I called down and supplies were delivered. I wanted a glass of wine and the two bars were super crowded and LOUD and a gentleman at the desk got a glass for me and I was able to drink it in the lobby while talking on the phone.

(prob because it was a corner room though) so we were very happy with this as i know new york hotel rooms are said to be on the small side. Lovely modern crisp feel to the room, very clean and simple, and to our taste. bathroom again decent size, lovely and clean, shampoo and conditioner products for us to use and towels changed everyday. large plasma tv on the wall and plenty of storage space for clothes and fluff bathrobes! not great view from the room but we were more interested in going out to see new york anyway! Great location, starbucks across the road, close to central park, 5th avanue, times square!! also lots of small eating places near by for breakfast and lunch! Subway at the corner of the block, which we used to get to places a little further away! defo the best way to get around, taxi's are too expensive!!

I only had a switch card with money on it as I wasnt expecting this and they refused this!! They also advised cash wasnt acceptable in the end we managed to put down $200 is cash for first night as we arrived on a saturday and then my mum back in the UK had to send a copy of her credit card which also we had problems with as they advised they didnt receive it then they found it just lying around and they blocked our room once also even though we had sorted this.

The reservation process was easy and friendly. The operator was full suggestions, but obviously this function is outsourced so the operator knew little of the small details about the hotel or the room. But he was very friendly and helpful overall. We booked an extra-extra large suite and the reservation was ready and accurate when we arrived around 2:00pm. I mentioned our anniversary when making the reservation and they noted that during check-in (no champagne or flowers though\u2026LOL). We also asked for a suite away from the top floors (because of the rooftop bar) and they complied. TIP: You can pull up right in front of the hotel. Someone will assist with bags and then deliver your car to a parking garage on Fifth Avenue (or so they said). Parking fee is added right to the bill ($35-$40).You can\u2019t get the car out without paying but why would you want to? Public transportation is abundant and convenient. The location of the hotel is perfect\u20263 blocks north to Columbus Circle and Central Park, four blocks south to Times Square and lots of stuff to the west and east. The subway is confusing but the grid pattern of the city is easy to get used to. Prepare to walk a lot. Right down the street (Broadway) is an excellent little caf\u00e9 \u2013 Europa. Good for morning tea and lunch nibbles. There\u2019s also a Starbucks two doors down. At no time did we feel unsafe in NYC no matter where we ventured within Manhattan. I\u2019m sure there are places you shouldn\u2019t go, but we stayed to the busy populated areas. The room was exactly as described (7th floor). Immaculate clean, nice soft robes, separate bathrooms, excellent shampoo and soaps\u2026The blue neon lights really make the room a different experience. And what they say about the bed is true \u2013 it\u2019s SUPER comfortable. Outside noise imposed on us just one night but the next nights were relatively quiet. There\u2019s no bleed over from room to room (as far as we could tell). TIP: Careful with the mini bar. If so much as remove a bottle or snack to look at it, the bar code automatically charges the item to your room. A slight complaint \u2013 no fridge room for water and there\u2019s no ice or vending machines in the hotel \u2013 you need to call room service \u2013 which means at least a tip. Each room has two flat screen TVs and two Bose radios. The water pressure in the shower was excellent and there was never a shortage of hot water. Air conditioning worked fine and was quiet for the most part. The concierge was always helpful and had maps and recommendations. The staff was friendly and unobtrusive. The housekeepers were pretty much invisible and did a good job. Checkout went smoothly and we called about 20 minutes in advance to have the car delivered to the front door. The hotel was generally clean and well-kept and we didn\u2019t notice any of the marks and dirt that other reviewers have noted. Perhaps it depends on the room you get? It sounds like the smaller rooms on the lower floors need some attention but I can\u2019t verify or comment. The elevators are not as slow as others have noted but they are a bit busier at night. The rooftop bar is a great experience. The first floor bar is very trendy and seems to turn into a dance club later in the evening. We only had breakfast from the restaurant (outside) and it was good but slightly cold because of the outdoors \u2013 a small trade off for the view. TIP: Drinks are expensive. We were paying $7 for a bottle of beer and $10-12 for an Absolut and cranberry. This may be normal depending on where you came from, but for us it was expensive. The drinks are ample and well made but compared to home, they were expensive. (Didn\u2019t stop us though\u2026) Although it may be expensive to stay at Dream, (rounds out to about $600 per night for the ex ex large suite + parking), it was worth every cent.", "Date": "August 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona, Spain", "Title": "\u201cTo hip or not to hip\u201d", "Author": "Mar005", "ReviewID": "UR19021850", "Content": "We have just returned from a week at the Dream Hotel. The hotel is in the list of the hip hotels of New York however it is definitely not that hip. In fact, the only hip thing about it is the location, it has a metro station just a few steps from the hotel door! We stayed on the first level so we were lucky that we could use the stairs to go to our room. The bar at the roof toop seems to be busy specially at weekends with all kind of \"want to be hip\" people with totally exagerated outfit. This means taking one of the two extremely slow elevators can take up some time. The hotel temperature is 65 F, that is about 18 C, which is absurd when you are wearing summer clothes. The housekeeping sets the temperature every day at 65 F in the rooms. If you want to set up the temperature higher, the air conditioning does not cool and therefore the room temperature goes up. We asked to get it fixed but this was not done. Perhaps they know this is just so and this is why rooms have winter bed clothing in plain summertime? The bar at the top is ok, however the staff are rude and not helpful or kind as you would expect in such hotel. When asking for the way back to the stairs to go down to my room I got a very rude answer: \"take the same way you got to get in\". Unbelievable. The concierges were kind but not specially helpful. We were shocked to hear that for 200 $ each they could sell seats for us a Broadway musical, of course with average prices 75-120 $ per seat at the theater itself we did not take such offer. Another funny one was that one of them did not know about an internet caf\u00e9 near the hotel - I recommend you to go to the Apple store to get access if you do not have a laptop with you. There are almost no internet caf\u00e9s in NY. The Serafina restaurant looked ok, but we did not have lunch there in the end. We asked for a table and they offered us to share one with other guests even if there was a table free (with 4 places). We do think it is unacceptable to ask us to share if there is a table free. In the inside of course and once again temperature was about 65 F.

The room itself is relatively ok with an LCD TV and a comfortable bed however the neon lighting under the bed and desk simply destroys the atmosphere, i usually am not one to write reviews but i was particularly disappointed with this facility especially given their higher price tag.

Throughout our stay we were shown nothing but good manners by all the staff who were helpful, attentive and happy to help with any queries. The hotel all around was very clean with a modern, chic feel; ranging from the polished marble floor with giant fish tank and the lovely looking spa downstairs to the blue strip lighting in the rooms and 2 good bars. The hotel was perfectly situated for everything that we wished to do, just a 5 minute walk to Times Square and the same to Central Park and 5th Avenue shops. I have read many reviews moaning about lack of service and small rooms but in reality how many people come to New York to sit in their rooms! We found we had more than enough space for our needs and can have nothing but praise for the staff suring our stay. It is true that food and drinks in the hotel aren't cheap but I think the same can be said for almost every hotel in New York. If I had one complaint it would be that on the days we visited it was almost impossible to get anywhere to sit in the rooftop Ava loungue. It was a very nice venue but we found it full of office workers with 'reserved' tables everwhere - perhaps a consideration to those who are staying there would be good. On Friday and Saturday night this turns into a very busy nightlife hotspot with queues outside and doormen checking entry. The bar downstairs however was very nice and not too full everytime we visited it. Our stay in New York was fantastic - the weather was great, we saw all the sights, did lots of shopping and had a brilliant time both during the day and at night.

Stayed in a small room for one night. The room and bathroom were incredibly tiny, even by new york standards, at the price point it was at (about $400). This aside, the location is great, the pizza from room service was yummy, the bed was super comfy, the blue light thing was mildly amusing, and the tv and bose sound system was great. Unfortunately this is all the positives I have to say about the hotel. I was placed on the 13th floor (heard on here from other reviewers about similar experiences) and was told the lounge is upstairs and there might be some slight noise. This was the BIGGEST under statement I have ever heard. Not only was the music blaring to the point where you could make out the words clearly, the picture on the wall was shaking (i kid you not), and the sound of footsteps on the upstairs deck was booming. Look, I'm in my twenties, go to bed pretty late, and noise generally does not bother me, but this was ridiculous. It was impossible to sleep until around 4 AM when the noise stopped. There obviously is a soundproofing issue and I just am baffled how they have rooms on this level. Staff was ok... upon my arrival the doorman (who's job was presumably to open the door) was standing there chatting with another staff member and made no attempt to open the door, even as I arrived with my bags (this happened each time I entered the hotel) and while I am more than capable of entering a building on my own, this left a pretty bad first impression. As I went up to my room, the tiny tiny hallway was blocked by the housekeeping cart as two of the housekeeping staff chatted in the open door to the room next to mine (cleaning nothing) and made no attempt to move the cart as I barely squeezed by into my room. Just was not what I would expect from the type of hotel Dream says itself to be. Parts of the room were worn down and needed revamping (ex the side tables had large chips of veneer missing and the window shades were stained.. yucky) The hallways and elevators were in similar states and certainly need revamping. Another slightly irritating thing is I checked on dream's hotel site through reservations and saw that there were small and medium rooms available ($400- 429 ish). I generally like to call and talk to an agent directly so I called reservations to reserve one of those types of rooms. Upon calling, the reservation agent insisted that the only room they had available was a suite at around $600. I hung up, thinking wow those rooms go fast, and for some reason checked on the website again immediately after getting off the phone and found the small and med rooms still available, booked this online... and what do you know, the room was there for me and available when I arrived.

If what you look for is something really luxurious, overly romantic or otherwise, it may not be your first choice. But for a general stay, where you spend your day around in the city and the night (plus a few hours during the day) at the hotel, it is a very pleasant accommodation alternative. It has kept some of that old style, charm and feeling. The staff were very friendly and forthcoming, be it carry luggage, borrow quick internet connection, order air-shuttle to airport or general inquiries. The entrance houses a huge aquarium in a cylinder-like shape. It is very beautiful to watch.

It was only two/three blocks from Central Park, and from the hotel entrance it was a mere 50 meters to the metro line that takes you straight down to Greenwich Village and around. There were breakfast/diners on every corner of the hotel. David Letterman\u00b4s show is also just around the corner, down on Broadway.

Having said that the staff at reception were very polite and we checked in no problem, the room was very clean and tidy but we had to do some serious space planning to fit what we needed where, i.e. putting suitcases in a very small cupboard, on the desk, chair etc. Bed was very comfortable but again small to fit both of us on (probably best for couples and not friends sharing), had great plasma telly and nice toiletries. A nice touch was the maids delivering fruit in the afternoon free of charge, very nice! One serious negative about the bathroom we had is that the shower curtain simply did not keep the water in so each time we had a shower the bathroom floor flooded, the step into the shower was simply too low to keep the water from not escaping so I ended up having to turn the shower against the wall to try and keep the water in one direction, not great for washing hair! Bathroom tiles could also have done with a scrub too, quite a bit of mould!

Despite this, it was comfy and clean and didn't feel cramped. Somehow, because of all the white decor and linens and the ethereal blue light I suspect, it actually felt airy. Everything was modern (very nice to have a fat screen TV hung out-of-the-way on the wall) and in fine working order. The quality of everything from the robes to the comforter to the bathroom fixtures was superb. The hotel staff was courteous and helpful.

For improvements and to rank higher in my opinion, the rooms need some upgrade treatments: * The chairs in the room were not comfortable to sit in and read - a nice reading chair would be good for a room in a hotel of this calibre * The bed was a mattress sitting on a wood frame - it was reasonably comfortable but would have been better with a boxspring/foundation underneath * The windows could use more upgraded sound proofing - I have stayed in NYC before so I do have an idea of amount of noise to expect, however I was on a bit of a loud street and close to it (was on 2nd floor facing onto 55th) and believe that the windows would benefit from more soundproofing * The clothes dresser was or functioned as if it was a cheaper design - the drawers stuck and the piece screamed lower quality (again for a hotel this calibre, I expected better) All in all the stay was decent and it is a good hotel - if the above areas were improved, my rating would be above average.", "Date": "August 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cNo dreaming in this hotel\u201d", "Author": "NYCBusinessTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR8443009", "Content": "Dream Hotel should have paid me $284 to stay in room 1316 which is located under the disco through which you have to suffer until 2 am from the loud disco beat.

First impressions - conveniently placed without being right over the noise on Broadway. Easy to get the subway or stroll down to theatre land. The check-in was Ok, swift and professional. Small lobby, very 'interesting' design, dressed smartly. Great hi-vis cylindrical fish tank by the check-in. The room: 7th floor, via 3 small lifts, small corridor! (They can be busy early evening as peolpe try to get to the Terrace for the bar and views). The double size bed is not big - it's a minimum spec double in our view, and two of you can battle for space. However - it is the most comfortable hotel bed I have slept in, take it for granted. They use a sort of soft lined duvet over the mattress, very cool. Beware U.S. hotel rooms - they are small, very small in general, unless you can afford top-line 5* experiences.You have to work your way around the bed, and 2 people cannot pass each other around the bed! Doesn't really matter when you are out and about, so a small niggle. Small but clean shower/toilet. Aircon was efficient, but can be noisy when on auto mode - it kicks-in and out with a loud noise which can wake you up. Great 40\" plasma screen which oversized for the room, but hey! Good music via the Bose system. Good sound insulation. Bizarre but cool blue lighting under the bed and on the desk. I would recommend a room away from the main street and not on the same side as the 3 lifts! The breakfast is good and OK value in the restaurant, but eat-out for all else. The downstairs Bar is neat and stylish, Terrace bar views excellent - beware it is seiged by New Yorkers and non-residents in the evening. You have to book to be sure of a seat!!

Simply not very professional. One person was dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. Room is again avant garde, ok and very roomy but the A/C rattled and the bed linens don't fit the bed so that they are continually coming off of the corners during the night. Halls are narrow and dark. Room service made three trips to get our simple order correct. No newspaper, had to request. Concierge was at best ok, but recommended one location that was closed for lunch when we got there. Had to find our own. The roof top bar shares elevators at night with the rooms so we had to wait our turn to just get to our room...and had to show ID just to get into the hotel. Probably need a dedicated elevator for their guests. Overall stay here only if you like the pure \"touristy\" section of NYC and like the avant garde to extreme.

We weren't disappointed - the room was spacious and very comfortable, with a decent bathroom, and a great AV system in the room. We enjoyed the 'finishing touches' - including the blue neon lights under the beds (a bit confusing after a few cosmopolitans, but quite cool!), and the Big Apples (ahem) left on the pillows in place of chocolates. The location is very good, just off Times Square, which although touristy is extremely handy for getting pretty much anywhere in Manhattan. Staff are very courteous, and were more than willing to help us store our bags for a couple of hours after check-out, and then help us to the taxi with them when we left. We ate at the restaurant a couple of times, and the food was pretty good. The biggest positive? The Ava Lounge. Rated as one of the best hotel bars in NYC, it's just fantastic. The Lounge is in two parts - an indoors area on the top floor of the hotel, with big windows overlooking Times Square itslef, and a roof terrace with views of the New York skyline. Service is good, drinks are well-made, and the atmosphere is excellent - a buzzy, suited-and-booted after-work crowd is followed by dressed-up late-night drinkers. The negatives? Well, it was expensive. Having booked online at a decent rate of about $250 per night for the room, we ended up paying a total of $900 for two nights. How? I'm not sure... I think it had something to do with starting a tab at the bar (oops), putting brunch and lunch in the restaurant on our room bill, and finally making a couple of (short, local) phonecalls that cost a grand total of $50.

Close to Central Park, 5th Avenue, theatres, short walk to the subway station. The Chopra Centre & Spa was amazing with one of the best massages I\u2019ve ever had. Thanks Joe! I also have to say that, contrary to other reviewer\u2019s statements, our room, number 910, was large even though it lacked wardrobe space. That's about it! The evening my partner and I arrived was a cold and rainy one. Our taxi pulled next to the curb and I noticed the bellman standing at the door and that's just where he stayed after I'd pulled my suitcase out of the taxi and was rolling it towards the door whilst my partner was struggling with his. He only acknowledged us once we where inside the lobby. With only a few exceptions most of the staff was just average. Nothing note worthy in a hotel that claims to be at the top of a competitive game. For a place called Dream you\u2019d expect each night to reach R.E.M. stage with no problem. Think again! Yes, the bed was comfortable but nothing to brag about. As noted by another reviewer the windows don\u2019t have double panels so you are treated to the sounds of the city; but what\u2019s more ironic is that just as many noises come from within the hotel. A very loud AC kicking in, a phone ringing in an adjacent room, guests talking about the day ahead or waiting for the lift. Oh! Yes, our room was located next to the elevators. One detail meant to impress the guests as they walk in, is the dramatic effect of the room flooded in a light-blue colour, product of the neon light emanating from the glass topped desk and underneath the bed. The turned on flat screen and soft music coming out of the excellent Bose system add to this illusion that you just walked into heaven\u2026until you open the door to a tan and blue tiled, grout covered bathtub, cream coloured mildew spotted plastic shower curtain Motel 6 style bathroom. I could go on talking about the run down appearance of the hotel (scratches are a common denominator in the lifts and bedroom furniture); tacky decors (a back lit screen with a dove that seems to be coming to attack you as you walk out the lifts on the 9th floor); the Ava Lounge which is more a club than a lounge (a must avoid if you want to have a conversation), with a bartender who doesn\u2019t know that martinis, whether shaken or stirred, are supposed to be served chilled \u2026I don\u2019t reckon I\u2019m too demanding! A bouncer at the Ava Lounge standing in front of the velvet roped staircase which leads to the terrace not letting you, a hotel guest, through to enjoy the so well advertised stunning views, but allowing pass it another gentleman accompanied by two beautiful women instead. But I won\u2019t dwell on that. I\u2019ve travelled quite a bit throughout the years and stayed at better and worse hotels than this one. The point I wish to make is that this hotel is just average and, like I said before, ridiculously overpriced regardless if it\u2019s Manhattan.

We had a wonderful stay while there. The hotel has a contemporary feel to it, from the pictures to the lightning in the rooms. We stayed in a medium queen room, room 302. The room was extremely clean and very quiet. There was not a view, but this is what kept the room so quiet so it was perfect for us. My fiance had planned a very special weekend in New York City for us as he was planning on proposing. He called ahead and thanks to the concierge, Kevin, he was able to have the hotel room prepared with rose pedals covering the room and champagne. With the blue lightning the room was extremely romantic. As for the size of the room, we were happy with it. Of course it's size must be considered by New York standards...let's face it, hotel rooms in New York City will be smaller. The room size was just fine, and much bigger than other New York hotel rooms I have stayed in. The bed was to die for. It was so comfortable I did not wake up once during the night, which is unusual for me. The tv was a nice big flat screen on the wall. The bathroom does not have a bathtub, just a decent sized shower. This was fine with us, but if that is something that is important to you, keep it in mind. We did not eat at the restaurant or go to the bar since we were only there for one night and had other plans in the city but from what I've heard and saw they both looked nice. We were also told that a dance floor will be opening very shortly. As for the service at the hotel, it was amazing. Everyone was extremely friendly and accommodating. As I state earlier, Kevin, the concierge, was wonderful. He made sure that our stay there was as special as my fiance hoped for. The rest of the staff are very friendly and pleasant as well. One of the biggest perks of this hotel is the location. It is located directly in the middle of everything. It is located on 55th and Broadway...four blocks from central park, a couple of blocks from 5th ave, and time square is straight down Broadway. Parking is $45 for 24 hours. If you choose to stay for a few hours past the 24 hour mark you will be charged the full $45, but it is well worth it considering the average parking price at other garages is about $15 per hour plus tax. We paid over $500 for the one night stay at the hotel plus the parking, but I believe the price was raised because it was St. Patrick's Day. Things you should do: Take a horse carriage ride though central park See a Broadway show Shop 5th avenue Visit time square I would recommend this hotel. It is nice, clean, and according to NY standards a nice size.

There was about a foot either side of the bed and that was the width of your room. Nowhere to store your case so ours stood propped up at the side of the bed doubling as a bedside table - thank god we only had one case. There was no in room safe, no Ipod, no docking bay...all of which should have been included as stated when we booked. On our first morning the toilet flooded. I attempted to flush and before I knew it water was pouring out onto the bathroom floor. We called the front of house who said they'd send someone up immediately (we were mopping up the water with our towels) and 20 minutes later we had to call again to chase. When maintanence turned up with a plunger he fixed the toilet but when I asked him about the adundance of wet towels spread over the floor he told me that wasn't his job. Fair enough!! The positives are a great location, just four blocks from central park, a stones throw from fifth avenue and times square (if you are there for the NY tourist experience). We visited most of the deli's/diners in the area and would definitely recommend the Carnegie, their sandwiches are ridiculously sized but worth every penny and you can take it with you when you leave. Although its the other side of town - go to 'Max's chocolate by the bald guy' just off of Union Square...this place is to die for - the best hot chocolate and the highlights; chocolate pizza and chocolate syringes. The beds at dream are the most comfortable we have slept in and the turndown service is pretty good - fruit left on your pillow and a weather forecast for the next day.

The room was very comfortable. Our room was on the 12th floor (room 1207, I believe) and we had two windows facing east, which provided us with great light throughout the day. The noise level was relatively low and the view was pretty good. The rooftop bar is a cool and comfortable spot to have a before- or after-dinner drink. The staff were outstanding throughout our visit -- helping me set up my internet connection, taking the mattress topper off our bed to firm it up a bit, providing directions and recommendations, hailing cabs, etc. I dealt with a gentleman named Adam who must have been one of the supervisors, and he went above-and-beyond the call to make sure I had everything I needed and that we were comfortable.

From the flat panel TV to the way they hang the towels, it's a good use of space. Second is that it is amazingly quiet. Maybe it was just our room, but overall I couldn't believe how quiet it was. And we were next to the elevator. Bose Wave radio's are a nice touch as well, and the robes are as soft as they come. The bars there are pretty good and seem to be popular. It was busy every evening. Negatives: It's small. But so are just about every other room in that area, so don't get hung up on this. Past that, the interior rooms views' are non-existent. And it was pretty stuffy.

Upon turning on to the street of the Dream it is (at night) the blue lit hotel. The lobby is impressive and the elevator opens up on your floor with a commanding back lit art piece to greet you. Our room was small by Midwest standards, but for us it was great. There was an impressive presentation- blue lit bed, blue lit desk, bose radio on, and a pear on the pillow.The bed was HEAVENLY I could not believe how comfortable it was. I had read reviews about the air conditioner being noisy, but I did not have that problem. The air conditioner was quiet and worked well. In fact, I was surprised how quiet it was in the room for being in the heart of the city. That was a great feature of the hotel - the comfort of the rooms being serene and the hotel lobby/lounges oozing with energy. A great night life- especially on the roof. I would HIGHLY recommend making an advance reservation for the roof top. Believe me you'll wish you had. All of the tables were reserved and I wished I had know that reservations were recommended. Because being on that roof felt luxurious and we both wished we could relax the night away up there. In the Ava lounge there is a delicious drink the KEY LIME MARTINI. Order it.

It is located a short and safe walk from Times Square, close to an ATM, close to the subway, and they will be adding a new dance club which sounded interesting.

Taking a tiny room and filling it with a tacky desk that has lights underneath does not make a hotel room neither does a 32 inch plasma screen positioned way too high on the wall. Still I could live with all that but the bathroom was frightening. If they had not moved my room I would have checked out and slept in Central park is I had too. As I opened the door a large group of Fruit flies started swirling around my head. There must have been 40 or more, they were everywhere. The tiles on the floor were filthy and full of grout, the fixtures were the cheapest I have ever seen, I swear they took the bathroom from a cheap motel and just copied it and I am dead serious about this point, I don\u2019t think the bathroom was ever cleaned and from the cheap shower curtain with mold all over it to the cheap shower head which had something else growing all over it to the odd hand soap it was a horrible nightmare especially after having paid almost 400 dollars... Oh and one more the thing the \"four\" star restaurant downstairs is just a cheap tourist restaurant disguised as something better. The service was horrible and the food even worse. It was the worst food I have ever tasted in New York. Instead of there try TGIF and you will get better service and food or even KFC would be better. If you want to spend 300 or 400 dollars on a room in New York try the 'Bryant Park Hotel' that is where I moved the next day and they are always perfect. The 'Maritime Hotel' is also excellent and both are priced the same as 'Dream.' The bottom line is don\u2019t even try this hotel it is not worth 100 dollars.

The internet connection was not wireless, but pretty fast and costs about $10/day until 12PM. Every morning we got newspaper outside the door, and there was fruit and a next-day-weather forecast on our bed when we come back at night!

The hotel had a great location on broadway, but the hotel entrance was from the 55th street... and the sidewalk next to the entrance had a lot of rubbish. Times square was close - just 5-10 minutes walk from the hotel :) The penthouse on the 14th floor had a nice outdoor lounge with bar and music..

Overall I thought The Dream was a great boutique hotel and I would definitely stay there again. For the price which was high 200's/mid 300's depending on the night, I thought it was a great value compared to most things you could book in NY for that cost. The overall look is very trendy and hip! The lobby & rooftop bar and restaurant are VERY cool and eclectic. You can tell the $$ went here as the rooms are more spare. The pictures on this website are very true to what you get. Not luxurious but cute and worked great for me. The airconditioner is LOUD. The windows open to let in fresh air which was great. Toiletries very nice and are from the Deepak Chopra center which is actually attached to the property so looked like some great though very pricey spa options ($185 & up for a massage) A big pro for the property is the fact that there are multiple restaurant/lounge options. The on-site restaurant has a great variety of delicious cuisine but bad service (see below). The bar upstairs has a penthouse view and a rooftop open air level that is great in the spring. Think there is also a bar on the lobby level. The location is unbeatable. 2 blocks south of Central Park, 3-4 blocks north of Times Square, 3-4 blocks west of 5th Ave shopping. The service is inconsistent! The hotel feels upscale because of the decor but the front desk does NOT give upscale service. They are friendly but untrained, too casual and lack the service standards that a hotel managed by a major brand like starwood, etc would have. Restaurant servers lack training. They are not rude, just spacey. I ate in the restaurant many times and it was fine for me & a colleague as the food was great but I would never bring a client as it would be embarassing. The concierges are great and very knowledeable about restaurants, give detailed directions & really took their time with us. Bellman were also super friendly and responsive. Housekeeping keeps things clean & in order but again service inconsistant. Sometimes for turndown I'd have fruit in my room, sometimes not, sometimes a weather report for the next day, sometimes not. Cons for the business traveller are that room service doesn't start in the morning until 7am and there is no business center altough lots of nearby kinko's. No wireless internet but high speed ineternet access is in the rooms.

I must admit that although I checked with TripAdvisor first and saw the bad reviews, I decided that sometimes people DO exaggerate and that I would like to see for myself... Well...First and foremost, before I go into the review, I must say that I applaud the effort they are making in putting together a different looking type of hotel and their attempt of making it a \"dream.\" The theme of the hotel is really nice and I do like some of the amenities they offer that most hotels do not (Flat screen plasma TV's, Bose stereos). BUT...unless you stay in the suites, the rooms are far too SMALL (especially for a six-day stay). So after the initial shock of the size of my room (although I was told that I was in a \"large\" room - it certainly wasn't the large that I'm used to), I found it to be clean and cute. In an effort to try and make up for the \"lack of space\" I decided to take advantage of the other amenities they boast about like the fully loaded IPOD and a DVD player so I can watch movies or listen to music. I was told that there wasn't an IPOD available as of yet and that I would be put on a list (which I eventually got the same day). They also went on to say that there would be a $400 hold placed on my credit card for the IPOD and a $200 hold for the DVD player. Wow, so much for amenities being included in your stay! All I wanted was to try to get as comfortable as possible for my six day stay so I agreed to it all....no big deal. On day three, after spending some time with relatives and returning to my room alone around 11:00pm, I got off the tiny elevator and walked down the dark hallway towards my room to find my door open! I immediately thought that I was being robbed. I began to check the closet, under the bed, and in the bathtub to make sure no one was in the room. This was a little frightening to say the least. It appears that when housekeeping was doing the evening \"turndown\" they accidently left my door open (which I found suspect because the doors are heavy and always slam close). I called down to the desk to make them aware of the situation. They apologized and asked if I wanted the key changed!? What difference would that make if housekeeping left it open in the first place! Did I mention that I had a laptop out on my desk that could have gotten stolen? Thank goodness that I had it locked to the table with a security cable. They asked me if I wanted to move to another room. I told them that it was late and I didn't feel like packing again to move, so I would let them know in the AM. The next day I decided that after that serious mishap I would call the Manager and demand an upgrade or leave the hotel. They cooperated and gave me a really nice suite (my girlfriend reported to me however, that they were working on a suite across the hall in the mornings, which caused a little but of a nuisance for her in the AM). It was quiet at night though, thank goodness and we especially enjoyed the bathroom in the suite because of the large jacuzzi/shower. The hotel is pretty new and is still under construction, so I imagine that it's pretty noisy during the day. One small note on the location - I didn't particularly care for the location (55th Street, between 7th and B'Way). I found that everytime I went out, I hated to walk back to the hotel through 7th avenue because of the smell of garbage amongst other things, so I always went back to the hotel through the Broadway side. Overall, we had a decent time and the upgrade to the suite was definitely a bonus. The staff was very accommodating and pretty much fulfilled all of my needs, but I honestly don't know if I would pay my own money to stay there again (my stay was company paid). The hotel is small but pretty (small elevators, small dark hallways and ofcourse the rooms - unless it's a suite), so if you want to try something new and different and don't mind small rooms, this is the place for you. If you can afford a suite, I'd recommend it, but if not, I'd probably stay at one of the more reliable Sheraton or Marriott hotels. Of course it won't be as pretty, but it's more secure and the rooms are bigger for the price.", "Date": "September 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cHotel Charged Credit Card After Cancellation\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3806885", "Content": "After reading some terrible reviews of this hotel (blood on the sheets?!), my boyfriend and I decided not to stay there.

The room was tiny, but no surprise I was warned. The thing I could not understand about the room deco was that why they would put such a huge desk and drawer in such a tiny room. Oversized desk and drawer took half space of the room. The bed taking the other half of the space, you really have to struggle a little nevigating around the room without bumping into the furnitures. They could have utilized the space a lot more with adquately sized desk and slimer/shallower drawer. And what is with the freaky neon light in the desk? There is the blue neon light and it bugged the hell out of me I kept turning it off. But the maid kept turning it back on everyday, sometimes twice a day. Later I gave up and lived with the light. Plasma TV meant nothing to me as no one sits around and watches TV in a hotel in NY. When I have infinite choices of flicks from grimiest Indie to the chic-est retro in NY, why pay for a generic movie in a hotel? Besides, you should go out at night. No time to watch TV.

People who chooses boutique hotel are more conscious of their looks than others. How could anyone leave out such important detail. Never mention boutique hotel, I've never been in a hotel without a full length mirror. For the 5 days there, I had no idea what I looked like.

I chose to be a little mismatched than blow 1300$. So, I am not impressed with Expedia either. For this reason, I would never ever go back to that imposter boutique hotel.

In New York, you need to speak up to get what you've paid for, but when you spend $300 a night you should not have too. Had I been passive, I would have spent the night in a tiny box. The hallways are way too dark, narrow and hot. Was I in a nightclub or a hotel hallway? The smallest hallways I have ever seen. No air conditioning could be felt on the floors, other than the lobby. The air conditioning unit in my room was on occasion, so loud, that it kept my wife awake. Plasma TV's are cool, but with only a handful of channels, no premium channels and no in-room movie purchases available, the Plasma wasn't a big deal. Like a Mercedes without wheels. No coffee makers in the room. Room service was inadequate. My wife ordered a large pot of coffee, and they only sent up one cup. Then the muffins came without any butter, jams or jellies. No one asked \"For how many\" room service was being ordered. The bathroom showed no style, in fact, bland is the first word that comes to mind. For the price paid, you can better at other hotels in New York.", "Date": "July 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "united kingdom", "Title": "\u201cwe'll definantly stay here again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3674865", "Content": "we stayed at the Dream for 5 nights and after reading bad reviews i was rather worried about staying there, but i had nothing to worry about.

In place of the headboard is a 7-foot square of upholstered plether - very comfortable for sitting in bed. The bed itself is solid and the sheets, etc. of very good quality. There is a desk/vanity that has a glass top so that you can't lose your items in the drawer. The bathroom is nicely designed with the details of a toilet paper dispenser opposite the commode - no twisting for paper! There is an excellent magnifying mirror that is set above the sink, not on the side. I am saving the best for last - someone extraordinary did the lighting. There are recessing lights in the ceiling with a dimmer switch. The closet has a light. There are two full sized architectural light fixtures on either side of the bed for excellent reading lighting. Underneath the bed is a long neon tube attached by brackets. Flip a switch next to the bed and a soft purplish/blue light is cast around the perimeter of the room at about 10 inches above the ground. It doesn't annoy you - more like settling into the glow of an aquarium. It is the ultimate night light - perhaps, you are like me and worry that getting up in the middle of the night, you may be disoriented and trip into something. This light eliminates that worry.

Doormen didn't open the door for us much on this stay......we giggled about it everytime we walked in...but that wasn't all that important to us.

Booked online at the Dream web site (dreamny). Rate was $212 a night plus all the other NY taxes, etc., which pushed the price closer to $250. A lower price could be found on Expedia, etc. but that was supposedly for a single bed. ROOM: Small, about 14 x 12 with very little room for anything but the queen size bed. Everything was painted white which helped make the room seem a little larger than it was. A nice 37\" Panasonic flat screen is mounted to the wall a couple feet from the end of the bed. While this may seem like a nice tech touch, I don't think the room could handle a regular TV, there would be no place to put it. Thus, the flat panel TV is almost a necessity. There were no movie channel offerings; only basic cable. The front desk told me they would be getting movies in the future. The room also had a nice Bose wave radio but I did not see or ask about the iPod that is suppposedly available with each room. Bathroom was very compact. Closet was barely big enough to fit the hangars. The Bed, comforter, sheets and pillows were all first rate...the best and only real asset of the room. This is becoming more popular in hotels, especially where the bed \"is\" the room. A small work desk with tech ports and plug is located next to the bed. Internet access was about $11 a day. LOBBY: Small and underwhelming. Dream is obivously going for the hip hotel image. It looks like they tried to pull this off with a very limited budget. It's not bad, but I doubt that you'll be impressed. SERVICE: Friendly...no problems. We (my wife and I) did not have a lot of interaction with the staff....check in and out and handling of luggage. RESTAURANT: We did not visit either of Dream's 2 lounges but did eat at the trendy Sefafina restaurant. Food was good, and restaurant was busling on a week night. LOCATION: Just east of the corner of Broadway and 55th. The location is great! I always prefer a midtown location when in NY and this would be about as good as any. OVERALL: The Dream is billed as a 4 star hotel. I'd put it closer to 3 1/2 although the bed and location are certainly pluses. I don't have anything really negative or positive to say about it. I read on Gayot that it was ranked on NY hip hotels list as #1. Many things in NY are ranked higher than they deserve to be...it's a NY thing. The \"Dream\" theme is carried out with minimal expense; dreamy/hip blue and white backlit photos greet you as you step out of the elevator on each floor and there are \"dreamy\" blue lights under your bed and work desk in the room.
