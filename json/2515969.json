I decided to stay at the Inn at Union Square because of the high ratings it received on Trip Advisor. I had stayed at the Hyatt around the corner on previous visits, and my stays were always very pleasant. This time around I'd thought I'd see why this obviously smaller, much simpler hotel was getting such high ratings. The answer, I think, was mentioned by one of the other guests during my stay...\"I love this hotel. They think of everything.\" I would say that just about sums it up. The complimentary breakfast is generous and VERY good. The \"parlour\" where the breakfast buffet is laid out is very tiny, with room for 4-6 people to eat. So every morning I loaded up one of the trays the hotel provides and took my breakfast back to my room, where I could catch up on CNN while I ate at my leisure. The complimentary wine service in the evening is pleasant, and the cheese and crackers they serve with the wine are REALLY tasty. My room at the back of the hotel was super quiet, and although I am a light sleeper, I slept really well. My taste in decor runs to clean, contemporary lines, however I found the slightly overstuffed and colorful furnishings here to be \"just right\" for the personality of the hotel. The bathroom is simple, but I took several long showers and never ran out of hot water. The staff was very friendly (including the irrepressible Ann, who is to \"bubbly\" what the Eiffel Tower is to landmarks.) The location is central to most San Francisco points-of-interest, and if you want to play tourist, there's a Cable Car stop a half a block from the front door. One thing in closing. A previous reviewer complained that the lobby is very tiny. I will agree there was no room for an indoor waterfall. But unless you are planning to hold your Junior Prom in the lobby of this hotel, you will find it--along with everything else--to be cozy, charming and welcoming.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWonderful, I didn't want to leave!!\u201d", "Author": "WaterLily13", "ReviewID": "UR129160938", "Content": "I loved The Inn at Union Square and felt like I had my own apartment in the heart of San Francisco.

The room faced Post Street and being able to open the window was wonderful for a little fresh Spring breeze through the rooms, especially at dusk when the tunes of the trumpet player wafted in from Union Square. A continental breakfast is included in the room price.

We planned for three nights in San Francisco, and then an additional 2 in Sonoma. I cannot say enough about this hotel, all positive. It felt intimate as if you were staying in someone's home. It was very clean. The innkeeper Wayne, not only helped us to pick great restaurants in San Francisco, but he recommended our now favorite winery in Sonoma County! Thank you Wayne for the complimentary wine tasting (Passalacqua)!! This hotel not only helped you with any and all recommendations for things to do around San Fran, but they made your stay so comfortable. Wine and cheese/crackers, fruit, soft drinks, and sparkling water were available nightly at the evening reception on floors 3 and 5 from 530-7 pm. The wine they served was great quality....no 2 dollar bottles here. You are able to get as many refills as you like. Breakfast offered a very nice selection of pastries, cereals, hardboiled eggs, toast, bagels, fresh milk, awesome Peet's coffee, and all types of Peet's teas. Orange juice, I could go on, I am sure I am forgetting something. The amenities include aveda bathing/hair products. We stayed on the 6th floor which can get a tad stuffy, because these older buildings do not have central air, but the windows open, and allow for the most peaceful sounds of the cable cars and city....truly, this was my favorite part. (And FYI, in San Fran, the weather is so nice, you truly don't need to pump the air conditioner...it was 80 degrees on day we were there, and opening the window, and using a nice fan that the front desk supplied for us, we were perfectly comfortable). I am planning to post some pictures as soon as I get a moment, but I wanted to get this review up and running for those thinking of staying at the Inn soon....you on't regret this stay. OH! And how can I forget, you are a minutes walk from union square....better shopping than NYC in my opinion, and I have shopped NYC many times! :) I will return with pictures soon!!!", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Service\u201d", "Author": "araks", "ReviewID": "UR128166034", "Content": "Caring staff, great location.

Is very clean and I loved the breakfast which is served at the end of floors 3 and 5.

Early evening you get wine, cheese and nibbles, and 9pm, cookies. I loved all of this and thought it a great touch. Free tea and coffee as well all added to the feeling that you were not in a hotel at all. The front desk staff were all fantastic and so helpful.

We had a room on the 5th floor, which is one of the floors where breakfast and the wine and cheese is served. Our room was second in from the elevator. The room was spotless and clean. It was quiet on this floor despite what other reviewers have said. We did look out on the wall of the next door building but we already knew this was going to be the case. We had enough light in the morning as we were higher up. It was not noisy and I am a light sleeper.The room had an overhead fan I think and kept the room at a good temperature. The king size bed was extremely comfortable. The room was a perfectly adequate size with enough room for a wardrobe, desk and armchair. The bathroom was spacious enough, just a shower no bath and stocked with Aveda products. All the staff who helped us were polite, friendly and helpful. We arrived way before check in and were able to leave our bags while we explored SF. The building is old and narrow but this wasn't a problem, even for my husband who is six foot and over 200 pounds. The extra touches like wine and cheese, turn down service with chocolates and water just added to the great experience. We arrived just as the wine and cheese was laid out and had our pick of complimentary wine, soda, water and cheese and other nibbly bits. The breakfast was beautifully presented with an array of pastries, juice and breads. I'm very picky about where I stay and I was most impressed with this hotel, I think it absolutely deserves the TripAdvisor rating.

We ended our trip in San Francisco and again stayed at the Inn on Union Square. Each time we came to the inn (3 times in total) we had a different room, and each time the room was clean, relatively quiet (just the sound of air conditioning or generators from other buildings in some rooms) and comfortable. Most of the rooms are at the back of the hotel with a view over the backs of other buildings, but we didn't mind, because we realised that if we'd had a view over Union Square it would have been too noisy. We paid for a regular Queen Room, but were upgraded to a Junior Suite at no extra charge without even asking for it. The staff were always friendly and helpful and made us feel most welcome. Omar at reception was particularly helpful, and it was he we saw most, as he was on duty over Christmas and New Year. He even sent a bottle of sparkling wine to our room when we returned from one of our trips to welcome us back. Wayne, the innkeeper, was also very friendly and helpful, and between them he and Omar provided us with lots of good tips on which restaurants and bars to visit. Anne, also on reception, went out of her way to be helpful too. The breakfast was served in the dining area on each floor, and there was a lot to choose from - bagels, pastries, cereals, fruit, etc, and although there was no minibar or fridge in the room, we were able to use the fridge in the dining area and make ourselves coffee or tea at any time of night or day. There was even a bowl of fruit there and a jar of home made cookies you could help yourself to any time. The cheese and wine reception every evening was also great fun. If we felt like socialising we could stay and mingle with Wayne and other guests, if not we could take some cheese and wine to our room. We were even encouraged to invite our friends along too, which was very generous. We'll definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and come back next time we visit San Francisco.

One night, she left our new toiletries on the bathroom counter but not 'in' the spots they should have been in. Another night, she set our bottles of water on the night stand. The next night, she put them in the sitting room we never sat in. * TV - The TV had Comcast digital boxes which was great. I love being able to look up what is on the TV and what channel I can flip to quickly. The downside was there was no 'sleep' function on the TV itself. This comes in so handy when you want to fall asleep but not wake to a infomercial running at 4am to a Shake Weight. *Entry Way - After a certain hour (I'm unsure when as it wasn't posted), you needed your room key to open the front door to the hotel lobby.

Let me start by saying that I have been a repeat guest at The Inn for the past 6 years. My first visit to The Inn was in January 2005, and I have been back every year since. If you are a first time visitor to San Francisco, or even if this is your 10th visit, let me explain why the Inn is the best pick for your trip to SF. SERVICE/STAFF: 5 stars. The front desk staff are professional, friendly, knowledgeble and accommodating. Because this hotel is a much smaller hotel, the staff here are personable and provide top customer service. Ken, Omar, Ann and Joe at the front desk have been there for years and are excellent at what they do. Wayne, the Innkeeper, provides wonderful hospitality and is extremely friendly. He will often be around during the evenings to meet and chat with the guests during wine hour. I can tell that the staff at The Inn really have passion in what they do, as I can see they always aim to make their guests happy and comfortable. HOTEL/ROOM: 5 stars As you should know if you don't already, this is a small, boutique hotel. Those of you who love to stick to large Hilton/Sheraton/Hyatt/Marriott brand chains and go for cookie cutter rooms, please be aware you will not find that here. However, you will find a very elegant, cozy and comfortable room waiting for you at The Inn. Yes, their hotel is small and yes, their rooms are a bit on the smaller side. But so what? Unless you plan on carting your entire bedroom with you on vacation, I highly doubt this will be an issue. And I also read about the complaints without an A/C. Yes, the Inn does not have A/C but first of all, SF tends to stay on the cooler/cold side almost all year long, with the exception of maybe 2 odd weeks and a few odd days in the September or October months. Additionally, the bedrooms are equipped with ceiling fans so that should help on a rare warm evening. In regards to the common areas, the lobby area is small but the only reason you go through the lobby is to come & go, speak with the staff or wait for a taxi/shuttle. The seating areas on each floor of the hotel are a nice touch and great to relax and have your breakfast and/or evening wine and cheese. AMENITIES: 5 stars The Inn is all about providing their guests with great amenities! -Aveda toiletries in the guest rooms -Daily continental breakfast (incl. pastries, yogurt, cereal, bananas, hard-boiled eggs, OJ, milk, coffee) -Evening wine & cheese hour w/ fellow guests -Nightly bottled water & chocolates to your room -Nightly cookies in the common areas LOCATION: 5 stars The Inn is all about location. They are located near the corner of Post & Powell streets, so this is a really great location for those who want to be in the center of town - especially for dining and shopping! Aside from the hotel itself, The Inn is so great for being in such a prime location! In conclusion, I HIGHLY recommend staying at The Inn at Union Square. You will experience a stay in SF that will be unlike staying anywhere else!", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood but surely not the 5th best in SF\u201d", "Author": "Notts_Today", "ReviewID": "UR120030218", "Content": "Don't get me wrong this is a very well run hotel with friendly knowledgeable staff but I cant rave about it like other people have. It reminded me of a very British B&B. The boutique personal atmosphere didn\u2019t win me over. It is exactly what I expect when I go to a privately run small B&B in England. We stayed for 5 nights, well actually it was 4 because of a 'plumbing problem' so we were put up in the Kensington Park Hotel(Rank 22) literally 10 seconds walk away. This caused us no problems and was thankful the Inn@USq dealt with this matter very professionally. The room at Inn@USq (apparently we got upgraded) was a small bedroom with a large bed with enough space to walk around, a separate room with sofa and desk and a bathroom. I don\u2019t know what level room this was but it was room 203. Couple of small stains on the carpet but everything else was to a good clean standard. Positives - Clean, excellent service, great location, well priced rooms, good breakfast (although I had to eat stood up one time due to lack of room. Also reading an earlier post about room 501...I actually said to my partner that we should be thankful we are not in that room.), good strong Wi-Fi signal, the cheese and wine is a nice touch but I never had it due to always being out at that time. Staff couldn\u2019t do enough for you if you required assistance. Negatives \u2013 Small and you seem to be in the way often. Sometimes I just want to be quiet and go about my own business but here I always felt you had to be involved in conversation. I found it very pokey whereas the modern hotels you get lots of space. The breakfast area needs looking at, I don\u2019t want to go to a hotel and eat standing or as the post below stated....do a DIY! , small room with no air conditioning which made it stuffy sometimes. Overall \u2013 A good place to stay. Good location. If you want to get the cable car to Fishy Wharf then get up for an early one!!!!! The queue was mighty long. If the parking is to be paid by you and not a business we parked the car ourselves with no hassle just around the corner and saved ourselves at least $50. I thought the valet was expensive (and we knew once the car was parked it wasn\u2019t moving for 5 days). 5th best hotel in SF? No. 5th best service in SF?

They were friendly, engaging, knowledgable, they addressed our concerns professionlly and with a smile on their face. What a pleasure dealing with people who take their job seriously and do it well. Their service was first rate. As often happens with our travel plans, they changed on the go. Rather then returning to the airport with a car rental to go home, we decided to return to SF for a couple extra nights. Not having anything booked and the Inn booked, we asked to be emailed if anything opened up. Before we had returned, the staff had notified us of an opening and booked us in for our last two nights. Having to return the vehicle by noon we were prepared to wait to check but upon our arrival we found a room ready. The rooms we stayed in were the '06 rooms. They are a jr. suite room. There was room to spread out in they were clean and well kept and the bed was comfortable. Don't worry about no air conditioning SF is a maritime climate and cools at night. Open a window and leave the fan on you'll be fine. What a convenience to be able to have a quick light or more sustaining breakfast in the sitting rooms on the third and fifth floors. Over a cup of coffee with a stranger, we discovered we had a mutual friend, how cool! In the evening these sitting rooms were set with snacks, drinks and wine. Staying twice over a period of time we literally visited with fellow travelers from around the world. These conversations at times were so interesting that evening plans often got pushed back. The one time this didn't happen was the evening a busker was playing a wonderful jazz trumpet in the square. His music kept drifting in the open window, we finally walked over to listen.

It's a lovely old building and unlike the other hotels we stayed at in the US on our trip, a continental breakfast was included in the room rate. There are some real plus points to this hotel: location, wine time, free internet and great staff being most notable. The location couldn't be better - very close to Union Square with its upscale shops and the Westfield shopping centre, very handy for the cable cars and also close to some great restaurants (you must try Scala's Bistro, just a short walk away - but book ahead if possible). There's also wine time, when between 5.30 and 7.00pm you can drink wine and eat cheese and biscuits with your fellow guests. Free alcohol's always a plus, but it also means that you actually get to meet and chat with fellow travellers. The free wi-fi is great. The connection here seemed super fast. I was able to stream video clips from YouTube and surf the internet as effortlessly as if I was on my home wi-fi. It was also very easy to connect to. We had possibly the warmest welcome I've ever experienced when we arrived, from Ann, who was larger than life and exceptionally friendly (as were all staff we encountered). I cannot praise Ann highly enough, because I think that this kind of personality is lacking in so many hotels (on our trip we also stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in Vegas - five star luxury, but they needed an Ann...). During our stay, personal touches included front desk calling us on our last night to see if we needed help arranging transport to the airport. There's also a turn-down service where they bring you water and pillow chocolates. Unlike many hotels, the room we stayed in wasn't air conditioned and instead had a great ceiling fan. We liked this feature a lot as it meant that we managed to get a night's sleep without having all of the moisture sucked from our bodies. San Francisco is not hot generally, so air con really isn't needed. In terms of room amenities, the bed was large and very comfortable. The curtains shut to make the room very dark at night (I'm a light sleeper so this is very important). In the bathroom there were nice Aveda toiletry freebies. There was an iron and ironing board and even an umbrella in the cupboard for our use. The downsides of the hotel (there are always some): the room we stayed in was quite small. It would have been fine for two or three days. For a six night stay, it was too small and I started to feel penned in. I can't comment on how large the other guest rooms are though. Because space in our room was tight, the safe was on a high shelf. I'm 5'11 and had to stand on a chair to try and find things in there. Just a few pointers for those who have never been to SF before: You will see more homeless and crazy people in one place than you will have ever seen before in total. It's very sad. The area around City Hall is worst of all. Fisherman's Wharf is the equivalent of London's Leicester Square - a complete tourist trap. There are lots of hotels round here and I'm so glad we didn't stay at one. The wine train is definitely worth a day out and I would highly recommend a few hours sailing under the Golden Gate Bridge in a catamaran. The queue for cable cars at the turnaround point is sometimes an hour's wait.

We arrived late on a Monday afternoon and immediately felt like we were family due to the friendliness of the staff. Our junior suite on the 5th floor at the back of the hotel and was very quiet, clean and well-appointed--king bed, big-screen TV, desk, dresser with large drawers, couch and chair. We were able to unpack and store our 3 suitcases without feeling at all cramped. The bathroom was small but well-organized with the toilet and shower separate from the vanity. There is storage in the vanity as well as a hair dryer. (I can't comment on the quality of the dryer as I bring my own travel-sized dryer and didn't use the hotel's). The breakfast was fantastic--hard-boiled eggs, bread, rolls, cold cereals (including delicious organic granola), skim or low-fat milk, yogurt, coffee and (I think) tea. I'm not a hot-drink person so I can't say for sure what other options there were besides coffee. We always took a tray back to our room, as seating is pretty tight for more than 2 people. The other guests in the breakfast area were friendly and interesting, and we enjoyed the brief visits while preparing our trays. The full breakfast saved us considerable time and money during our stay, and the family-like atmosphere is a bonus. We were always out and about in the afternoons, so we missed the receptions. We did come in early one evening when the people were gone but the food was still there, and of course we couldn't resist the goodies! Once again, delicious--mixed nuts, cheese and crackers, dried fruits, chocolate chip cookies (even my husband loved the cookies, and he's not a fan of chocolate chip). This is what stands out in my memory, but I wouldn't be surprised if other things were offered as well. Fresh oranges and apples are available on every floor all the time, and we loved this. It was great to be able to grab a healthy snack on the run. The location couldn't be better--a short walk to many restaurants and shopping and all public transportation. There is a 24-hour Walgreen's around the corner for any run-of-the-mill needs. On Wednesday night before we were scheduled to leave on Friday morning, I asked to reserve a cab to take us to the airport rather than depend on hailing one when we needed to leave. The friendly host at the desk said he would arrange it (I'm so sorry that I don't recall his name, but he couldn't have been nicer). We expected a normal cab to show up on Friday, so we were pleasantly surprised when a driver in a suit showed up (not only on-time, but a few minutes early) in a spotless Lincoln Town Car! He was very courteous and the price was the same as a normal cab. He said that the Inn would use his service only after verifying his license, insurance coverage, etc. We loved everything about the staff and the hotel itself, but the positive experience with the cab put it over the top.

I have to agree with some other reviews here, whilst we had a pleasant time, I would not say that The Inn was anything 'special'. The first thing you will notice is that the property is quite narrow, and the room we had, 501 was a long, narrow room. The Inn offers a continental style breakfast, which is served on a little area on each floor, this area is directly outside room 501 on the 5th floor, so don't expect a sleep in because from 8am all you will hear is people having breakfast outside your door. Seating is limited to 4 people in this area, so if you time it wrong you wont have anywhere to sit, and will have to do you own DIY room service breakfast on the provided trays. The Inn also serves wine and cheese each evening in these locations, which was a nice touch, again if you late, you will be sitting on the floor due to the limited seating. Our room was nice, however the bathroom towels could do with a refresh and larger bath sheets rather than the small towels provided. Valet parking is expensive, but this is true of all parking in this area, that said our car was always delivered within minutes of asking for it. The staff could not be faulted, perfect service delivery, friendliness and a pleasure. I guess the acid test, would we return?

We arrived much later than expected due to flight delays from Seattle - not a problem for the staff as we were warmly welcomed and ushered to the final 15mins of Happy Hour. Great way to have a pre dinner drink, bit of a nibble (plenty of food and wine!) and meet other guests. Luckily Happy Hour was on our floor - even more convenient. Our room was comfortably appointed, great bed, nice amenities. We did find the wardrobe arrangement a bit strange - in the bathroom! And the safe was impossible to reach for me and located behind a door. Luckily my husband is pretty tall and could access it. Minor complaint and easily fixed. No view to speak of from the window - but that meant a quiet restful sleep. Breakfast was also served on our floor - lovely array of cold treats which could be eaten at the table there or taken on a tray to your room. Would have liked an oblong table and maybe 4 chairs, so that 2 couples could share the space, but we made it work for us. The staff on the front desk were most helpful and attentive.

The location of the hotel is excellent and we were able to walk to number of shopping areas, restaurants, to Chinatown and to catch the trolley or the cable car. The rooms were exceptionally clean, very comfortable and quaint. We like staying in the smaller hotels since they tend to have more character. In San Francisco, you do not need a hotel with air condiditoning (even in August)..we slept with the windows slightly open and did not hear a sound from the outside. Each room has a quiet ceiling fan too. We also loved the complimentary continental breakfast served at 7:30 AM and the complimentary wine and cheese that is served each evening at 5:30 PM (both nice touches). During breakfast and the \"happy hour\" we met a number of very nice and interesting guests from all over the world. This is part of the fun of staying in a hotel like this. Lastly, the hotel provides free internet...we used it and had no issues. We opted for the self parking option and the parking lot is 60 second walk down the street.

The room was charming, and in good shape. The staff were all friendly, professional, and helpful. When my boyfriend had a question about using the available computer/printer, the concierge was quick to help. We found whoever staffed the front desk to be incredibly helpful. They followed through making good dinner recommendations and taking care of reservations for us, calling a cab, and helping my boyfriend have beautiful flowers delivered for my birthday. I felt they also went the extra mile on the \"little\" things. For example, when they saw us walking up to the door to enter the lobby, they would quickly press the elevator button to call open the elevator for us. It's a small staff, and they smile, look you in the eye, and greet you when you enter/exit. It felt very personable.

Be warned, as an older building something's are small (halls and tub), but this was in no way a small room. I also stayed at the Milano (milano is not nearly as nice) and visited the Mosser-the inn is much nicer. I was a single male visiting for a conference and this place was great-I kind is miss it. If you're looking for something grande, this is not the place. This is the type of place that gives you personal attention and just makes you feel good. If you want a b&b experience here you can have it, but if you don't you you can skip the idle chit chat and parlor stories and treat this place like an embassy suite-I'm not one for b&bs but I likes this place for the warmth of your own apartment combined with the baic amenities and service of a hotel. Great format really. The basics-big rooms for any major metro area (San Fran, NYC,chicago, etc), flat screen LCD tv, aveda products, robes, good styling and good finish (ceramic tile, fresh simple wall paper and paint), good business room, light room(I was on the lowest floor but still had some natural light), etc. Staff were all smiles, and if anything probably too attentive. Night chocolates and bottle water were a nice choice. By sf standards this place was a steal for under $200 during my visit (game developers conference). Neighborhood is great. If your a busiess traveler who needs an impressive lobby, just bring clients to a nice dinner instead :) I was scared when I booked this place, I feel like an idiot now. Much better than a chain. Warning,book a low floor so you don't have to deal with the one old elevator. Wine and breakfast were on 3&5, singular floors might be aloghtloer nosier.

Here are the positives: 1) The Staff- Especially Anne and Omar. The Inn staff is perhaps the best thing about the hotel, excellent suggestions (especially off the tourist track) very personable and helpful. They helped with dinner suggestions, neighbourhoods to visit and wine valley tours. 2) Location is great- I am not sure about where the hotels are throughout SF but if you like shopping and being central it was great. Personally we really liked the neighborouhoods like cow's hollow, haight etc much more than Union Sq but I did not see many hotels out there. For Union, this was central for visiting the entire city. 3) Included Wine and Cheese in the evenings- a wonderful touch. 4) Rooms were clean, quiet and a bit dated, but no problems to report. If you want really modern / hip style rooms and a hotel, I would not recommend the Inn. If you like small and comfortable, I would. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it anytime and encourage anyone to talk with the staff to get the locals perspective on what to see and do in SF. I would say as a couple new to SF my wife and I really liked to walk the neighbourhoods to see the shops and cafes especially cow's hollow, haight, marina, and chinatown to name a few.... Two restaurants I would highly recommend are Bix (speakeasy style) and B-44 (spanish). Fisherman's Wharf wasn't for us, it felt like a cheesy amusement park, but would be great for kids.

Here is my review: Location- The location was absolutely perfect. Initially, I debated whether we should stay at union square or fisherman's wharf. I am glad we picked a hotel near union square especially this one. This hotel is a few steps from the actually union square courtyard area. It is surrounded by tons of shopping like Macy's, Nieman Marcus, Nike, and William Sonoma so although there are a lot of homeless people, we felt relatively safe in this area. If you go about 3 blocks south of the hotel, you are in Market Street which has more shopping and is a great place to find your transportation (cable cars, street cars, buses). Also, you can buy your transportation tickets from here (in front of Forever XXI). I recommended taking the public transportation to Fisherman's Wharf instead of walking because of the huge hills. If you are heading to the piers, embarcadero, or the ferry building, you can walk NE along Market Street and then walk along the piers because the land is flat. Service- The Staff at this hotel was great! Very friendly and willing to go out of there way to make our stay comfortable. We had a late flight out of San Francisco our last day so they held our luggage and invited us to their nightly wine and cheese. A very nice gesture! They offered us use of their washroom and business center and made sure we had transportation to the airport. Rooms- The staff upgraded us to a Jr. Suite and despite the size of the hallways and elevator, the room was quite spacious. All the windows open and I guess acts as your air conditioning (We are from South Florida so we are not use to that). There is no view of the city because the bedrooms are along the side and not the front of the building. We overlooked the roof of Morton's restaurant next door. Cleanliness- This is an older hotel and the first thing I noticed was the smell in the elevator and the hallways. To me, it smelled like bug spray but my boyfriend did not think so. When we arrived in the room, I noticed that the shower curtain was stained and notified the front desk the next morning and they fixed it right away. Also, the next night, I noticed a stain on the sheets and asked them to replace it and they did. After that, I did not encounter any further problems but is the reason why I gave them 3 out of 5 stars. Value- The breakfast and nightly wine and cheese were a plus for us. There is no gym in this hotel but they do offer a day pass for $15.00 to the gym around the corner. I think overall, this was a great hotel to stay at. I am very particular when it comes to cleanliness but the other factors outweigh the few problems I encountered with that. .", "Date": "July 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA.", "Title": "\u201cWhat a fabulous location!\u201d", "Author": "ScratchBostonMA", "ReviewID": "UR71707963", "Content": "This small boutique hotel lavishes it's guests with clean spacious suites , free breakfast, and complimentary wine and cheese tastings each early evening.

The place is tiny. It is clearly one of the older buildings in the area as the structure is only six stories and everything is on the small size. The walkways are small, but if you've been to some European or Asian hotels, you have seen comparable sizes. The rooms themselves were on the small size, even for a San Francisco hotel and we stayed in a Junior Queen Suite. The bathrooms are miniscule. There is barely enough room to move around in there and it is very tough to get all of your toiletries on the counter (and I don't have many). The room itself was clean although the sheets were wrinkled even before we sat on them. The pillows and mattress are not the most comfortable. I have a much better night's rest on my siemens beautyrest. There wasn't an air conditioning unit that I could see. I really like to turn on the AC and snuggle under the covers and I wasn't able to do that at this hotel. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful, however housekeeping needs some work. We were without bath towels two days in a row (and we were only staying in the hotel for two days). It was ridiculous. I have never not had any bath towels let alone two days in a row. On the first day, there was only one hand towel in the room. We called down to the front desk twice and no one answered so my boyfriend was required to walk downstairs to the lobby to find someone to give us towels. The second night, again no towels! At least on the second night, the front desk answered the phone and brought up two towels immediately. I would give service a four if not for housekeeping not providing me with towels. However the best part of this place is the location. You absolutely cannot beat the location. Literally steps away from union square, if you are in the area for shopping this is a good location so that you can buy stuff and haul it back to the room. It's also a short distance from the trolley end of the line.

The Inn is located less than half a block off of San Francisco's historic Union Square and is within easy walking distance of the main shopping district, China Town, the main trolley station at Powell, which can take you most of the places you'd want to go when visiting San Francisco. The staff is phenomenal at the Inn, always doing little things that make your stay special. One example: I returned one morning from grabbing our Starbucks (not necessary since the Inn provides a terrific continental breakfast each morning as well as complimentary wine and cheese each evening) and my hands were full because I'd also stopped by the Walgreens around the corner to grab a couple of supplies. The front desk manager called the elevator for me and helped me get to my floor. It may not seem like a big deal, but it was a significant touch that made our stay that much easier.

Speaking of sweet...he also told us they upgraded us to a jr. suite! Awesome! The room was really cool...very Victorian kind of decor (only gave 4 stars in the review because saw some other rooms and could see someone maybe not being all that happy with the size). The view was of a little courtyard that backed up to some tattered older buildings, but it was WAY quiet! And based on many of our other stays in SF in boutiques, that was a welcomed change. Being from Vegas we were concerned about there being no AC in the rooms. However, even with the windows shut, the ceiling fan kept the air circulating and it was pleasant. Afternoon wine and cheese from 5:30-7pm was awesome! Serve yourself and eat and chat with other guests or take back to the room and relax. Continental breakfast was nice. Nice danishes, bagels, croissants, great caramel nut rolls, fruits, yogurts, hard boiled eggs, coffee, etc...

We were wooed to try the Inn by a great rate from a private sale website, and by positive TA reviews. The Inn is no Mandarin in terms of luxury, views or amenities, but for its unassuming demeanor and small size, it's chock full of nice touches and has a definite bed-and-breakfast feel. We were pleasantly surprised. The Inn is an easy 3 block walk from the Powell Street BART Station, which we took from SFO airport. The location 1/2 block from Union Square is ideal for tourists--so close to so many restaurants, shops, and attractions such as the cable cars. Taxis are easily found, and many public transportation stops are nearby. The Inn itself was originally another hotel and was reconfigured about 20-30 years ago. It most recently was refreshed about 4 years ago. The Inn is a narrow building with a long corridor down one side on each of its 6 floors, from which all the 30 rooms are entered. All rooms face a little alley between the Inn and the adjacent building--lower level rooms face a brick wall, while upper level rooms get a bit more light and a view of the next building's rooftop A/C equipment. One room per floor also faces Post St., as does a \"lobby\" on each floor--a small, quaint lounge area with a table and chairs, window bench, fireplace and sideboard. It is here where the Inn offers numerous treats throughout the day. There are: 1)apples and tea all the time 2) continental breakfast daily on floors 3 and 5 from 7-10am--a variety of carbs--bagels, bread for toast, pastries, scones, muffins, croissant, cereal, granola--plus yogurt, OJ, hard boiled eggs. There are trays to take to your room. 3) wine, cheese, crackers, fresh and dried fruit, nuts and sodas served from 5:30-7pm, also on levels 3 and 5. 4) cookies (recently baked, not commercially baked), tea and bottled water from 8:30-11pm. Quite impressive! We booked a Junior Suite Queen, a larger room than the Deluxe room, which looked small but comfortable. The Suite was nice, with a queen bed and sitting area with pull-out sofa, chair, desk and flat screen TV. The bath was split and small, but with nice amenities, including robes. There is no A/C, but the windows open and there is a ceiling fan. The bedside clock has a CD player and nature sounds. Although the Inn's literature touted twice-daily maid service, we never received evening turndown service, although the daytime service was fine. Since there is no restaurant, the Inn offers room service from an outside company. The lobby is tiny and was staffed usually by just one friendly person who also does concierge duties--they even called us the day before our departure to see if we needed airport transportation assistance. For security, a room key is needed to enter the front door, to use the elevator, and to get past the first floor by stairs. There is a small one-computer business center on the 2nd floor.

It was difficult to find restaurants that I wanted to go to, or to map out my route using public transportation without the internet.

The hotel has a quirky charm that grows on you throughout your stay there. The check in was very smooth and the front desk attendant could not have been more pleasant. My suite was very clean, but missing a few things. The bathroom was clean, but in need of some renovation (water handles in the shower were falling off and it was very worn). The rooms had very nice robes and excellent Aveda bath products. However, the some of the towels were a bit worn out and had some frayed edges (not quite up to par), compared to everything else. The living room area desparately needed a coffee table to set things down on, so you don't have to use the desk chair. The good part of the rooms is that they are very quiet (a rare find in a downtown location), however the reason that they are so quiet is that the windows have a view of the brick wall of the building next door. It was nice to be able to open the window though, as there were no a/c controls or vents in my room and it was a bit hot during the day. It was still hot out, but cooled off enough at night to sleep with the ceiling fan on high and the windows opened. The high speed internet was nice and fairly fast. On the plus side again, are the sitting areas on each floor. It was nice to be able to get up and have coffee each morning and work on my laptop in the common area (which has a window and view out to Union Square. The hotel has an arrangement with a very nice local health club (just around the corner) to work out, but the cost is $15 per day (a bit much, as most higher end hotels offer a fitness center or free workout passes). The daily continental breakfast was fine and the afternoon wine and cheese reception was nice (the wine was actually enjoyable and the cheese selection was interesting and pleasurable, unlike most other hotel receptions with unpalatable wine and cubed swiss, cheddar and pepper jack).

Evening wine, cheese, and fruit plus morning breakfast, both served in a quaint library setting, were a spontaneous gathering time for hotel guests. You had an opportunity to meet and talk with others that you would be difficult to replicate in a large hotel. The inn keeper met guests in the library at the time of the evening wine and cheese, a sign of the commitment this hotel has to its clientel. The breakfast choices were different from what you find at most chain hotels, and were appreciated over the cookie cutter approach to morning meals. In particular, the granola was excellent and the pecan rolls and almond croissants melted in your mouth. There were chocolate chip cookies on each floor in the later evening, and the staff members were responsive to every request. For example, we asked for fresh coffee at 10 p.m., and it was ready in the library within minutes. The rooms were modest in size and the shower was small but the room appointments were high quality and the bed was excellent. We slept so well both due to the mattress and the quiet, restful atmosphere. The location was ideal, a few steps from Union Square and the cable cars, and a brief walk to China Town and the Powell Street BART station. If you are looking for a large hotel with big rooms and lavish baths, this is not the place.

If I said the reception I received was amazing, I would honestly be cheating you of the true experience. We were made to feel like the most special customers on the planet. Courtesy was displayed in abundance; whoever trains or selects the staff should receive a medal. They couldn\u2019t give us enough advice or assistance with planning our stay. Nothing was a problem in the slightest. I was deeply impressed by the service I received, a big thank you to everyone there for that. I found the room very bright, airy and comfortable. The decor was to a good standard and the fixtures and fittings seemed totally appropriate for my requirements. The hotel is full on environment aware so everything is about going green. And it works. There\u2019s even a superb mission statement outside the lift that supports the hotels commitment to the customer and to the environment. And I firmly believe they mean what they say. Breakfast was served down the corridor in a special reserved area. Mmmmm I thought sounds dodgy but you know something, even that was great! A nice touch was the local newspaper on the doorstep in the morning. It all really got too much when reception rang me, totally unprompted to ask if they could book me a taxi as I was leaving in the morning. Absolutely switched on to every need I reckon. 10 out of 10 to this hotel. Thanks for the superb stay. This hotel should be the benchmark for all others to meet, I\u2019m totally serious. Definitely don\u2019t go anywhere else you\u2019d be crazy...... I'm going on so much about how good it is I forgot to say the location is good as well.

We stayed on the 5th floor which has breakfast set up every morning and the evening wine and cheese reception, easy access from your room. Breakfast every morning was superb, toast, pastries, muffins, hard boiled eggs, juice, coffee, yougurt, fresh fruit just awesome before hitiing the sights. You can catch the cable cars just meters down the street from the hotel. At 5.30pm every night wonderful wine and chees reception on the 5th and 3rd floors, great local wines, wonderful fruit and cheese platters and soft drink (pop) if you do not want to sample lovely wines from Napa! Great way to meet new people and get some great ideas on what to see and do. The staff at the hotel were simply wonderful, ask for anything from directions to rental cars to transport to restaurants nothing was too hard. The hotels location is simply wonderful, catch the bart from the airport and a short walk from powell street and you are at the hotel. We went to the baseball to see the giants and got to the park in less than 10 minutes from the hotel using public transport, easy and cheap and AT&T park is awesome. The rooms are a little small but for 2 adults on vacation from freezing cold Edmonton it was just perfect. We are originally from Australia and met many Aussies on our trip many of which stayed at the hotel as well, very popular with folks from downunder and again can't recommend the hotel enough.

How I missed that the hotel was not air conditioned - I have no idea - but I am glad I missed it since it would have kept me from staying. Now that I have been, I did not even miss the AC - an open window is all that was needed. Migh be a little warm during the summer though. Would I say here again?

Our room was at the end of the hall where the breakfast was served, but since we were coming from the east coast we were always awake before we heard them setting up around 7:00. The gathering area on our floor was a neat way to exchange experiences with other guests. It was fun to compare notes at the end of the day over a cup of hot tea or glass of wine. The lack of air conditioning led to one of our pleasant experiences while in the room. We would open the door on occasion to get the breeze from the hall to cool the room down. One evening a staff member passed by and commented on the nice, cool breeze with the windows open and then came back with several extra bottles of water for us. Omar always seemed to be at the front desk when we passed by and was always friendly and helpful. Overall - nice, clean hotel in a great location. Friendly staff that was happy to help out.

Right off the trolley line and union square, breakfast and snacks included, ROBES in the room, friendly & helpful staff, and extremely comfortable rooms. I read on a few reviews about the rooms being small, but I have to disagree with this. We stayed in a regular king, and there was more than enough room. A side table with two chairs on one side, and a desk/vanity on the other side. The bathroom is a good size, not massive, but I have stayed in places with much smaller. No AC, but had a ceiling fan and opened our window. Our view was a brick wall, but we didn't mind because our room was quiet as can be. I love staying at hotels, it is always a thrill for me, and I have stayed in a lot of hotels. This place goes on the top of my list, seriously.

Loved the extensive complementary breakfast set ups in the kitchen/sitting areas at the end of each floor, and the wine and cheese presentation from 5:30 p.m. until 7:00 p.m. was a nice way to get to know other hotel occupants and experience some good wine and snacks--a little briefing to what we experienced on the second leg of our trip, Napa and Sonoma Valley for wine tasting! Great suggestions from the front desk personnel on places to go, eat and see. The hotel is so centrally located, we were within walking distance to most attractions: Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco Center Shopping Mall, Chinatown, and great restaurants with diverse ethnic cuisines. We walked around the corner from the hotel one night to take in some good blues at a club called Biscuits and Blues. The last night of our stay, we took a short walk to a lovely French restaurant called Cafe Claude.

What a wonderful place! We booked a queen room, but got a small suite at the front of the hotel - the bed was a little smaller, but it had a separate sitting room with a sofa, chair and desk and a second plasma flat screen tv. But the great thing about this inn is the extras, which are offered free of charge. First, breakfast is served each morning until 10 or so on each floor on the third and fifth floors parlours. The quality is good, with fresh high quality pastries and coffee as well as cereal, boiled eggs, bagels, cheese, fruit, tea, etc. It is served on china and cloth napkins with nice breakfast trays to take back to your room and small tables to eat in the parlour. Also, there are fresh apples and cookies in each parlour all day long. At 5 or so, they set out multiple bottles of wine with really good cheese and fruit and stemware and napkins again and welcome you to a drink before you go out to dinner. There are also other cold drinks set out. All free of charge. There is wireless internet available free of charge, as well as a small business center. At night, the maid leaves bottled water and chocolate. At the end of the weekend, we had not a single incidental charge. The staff is young and enthusiastic and they are genuinely helpful. Be warned - this is an inn more than a hotel - it is narrow and the hallways are narrow as well. The elevator is small and there is no grand lobby, just a number of small parlours. But the rooms are tastefully done with good linens and the furniture and tvs are of good quality. There is no noise from room to room, and our room was right outside the parlour where folks on our floor had breakfast. There is some noise from the street - it is 500 feet off Powell and those streetcars do make noise, so if you really like it quiet, get a room in back. The rooms in front offer a nice view to compensate for the noise. In the last five years, we have stayed at the St. Francis (fancy, but not great service), the Fairmont (grand old gem, but so big), the Villa Forence (really nice boutique hotel), the Hotel Griffon (great location, unfriendly staff) and the Holiday Inn Gateway (utilitarian, no frills). This was by far my favorite. It is for those who like privacy and value. If you want a grand lobby, you will have to cross the street to the St. Francis.

A wonderful location, just steps away from everything including Union Square, theaters, the best restaurants, the trolley, and all the fun shops and stores. The hotel is early 1900's but has been renovated from top to bottom and is very charming and very clean. We were going on a driving trip, so we got our car at the airport and self-parked it a block away from the Inn during the time we were there and used the trolley everywhere. The parking lot is cheaper than the hotel's valet service by $20- they can tell you the exact location. If you use the valet service, it's about $41 or so with in and out service, but you have to wait. The rooms are very clean, our master bed was pretty good, not great (the rollaway our child slept on was lumpy and thin unfortunately). The linens were very good quality. Bathrooms small but what you'd expect for a downtown hotel. I really liked the complimentary toiletries - a rosemary and mint fragrance that is so San Francisco! The rooms are smallish for 3 but we made do without a problem - for 2 it would be perfect. The view is non-existent - looks out on another building nearby, but here's the nice part: sheers cover the window so you don't see the building and light comes in, and because it does not face the street, the room is extremely quiet and great for a good night's sleep. We opened the window, which I like more than those sealed up skyscraper hotels, and kept the ceiling fan on. We did not use the heat because we were comfortable with a cool room. There is no A/C so not sure what it would be like in the summer. If you want a bigger room that looks out on Post street below, get a suite. They have a pull-out sofa bed with queen bed and cost a little more. In the mornings, an elaborate continental breakfast is set out in the fireplace keeping room at the end of each floor's lobby. Everything from freshly boiled eggs to sourdough toast, cheeses, bagels & cream cheese, sweet rolls, fruit, fresh juices, fresh coffee and tea and more. In the evening, a lovely assortment of cheeses, crackers and wines await you after a day of sightseeing. It's all self-serve, very private and so much better quality than one would expect. The hotel reception was very friendly, although the lobby is small. We liked that about it and felt it was quaint.

No problem, just keep the sheers closed and you won't see it. We were in room 605 which had a bedroom with a king bed with a living room and woodburning fireplace(didn't need or have time for it). Bathroom had a whirlpool tub and separate shower(great water pressure). Bathrom was small, but didn't matter because there was a separate dressing room with a sink and long counter top so I could dry my hair and put on makeup with PLENTY of room. After 2 days, we realized there was another small powder room off the living area. The room had a fridge, and water was left each day. Bed was comfortable and the room was fine, maybe 3 1/2 stars.

Breakfast was on floor 3 and 5. No big deal that we had to go down a floor to get it--they had trays if you wanted to bring it to your room. Wine and cheese were available on the same floors from 5:30-7 I think, as well as various sodas. All was very nice. My only complaint was that the glasses weren't very clean--lipstick smudges were still on them. Had to hunt for one that was really clean. Same for the morning juice glasses.

Boy did I choose wisely! They stayed at the Westin and The Inn was right across the street, perfect. After a day of sightseeing and shopping our group of 6 always choose to wind down at our hotel because as they said \"it's more fun!\" They have quaint sitting areas and serve wine and snacks, great for chit chat and meeting other guest. This is included in your stay. We stayed in a King suite and compared to the rooms at the Westin it was the Taj Mahal. The room was very well appointed with beautiful linen, two flat screen tvs, closet space galore and a lovely sitting room. The only thing this hotel lacks is a restaurant to make it a 5 star but the Farallon is 10 steps away. Our friends have never stayed at a smaller property in SF but after experiencing The Inn they are converted. You will also feel secure here- in order to use the elevator or stairs you have to slide your room key. As far as comfort the bed was wonderful with feather pillows and the room was pitch dark and very quiet- I slept like a baby. In the morning you only had to walk down the hallway to find coffee or tea you didn't have to go hunting for it or wait for room service, I love having coffee while I get ready for my day. The complimentary continental breakfast was fresh and had numerous choices; fruit, pastry, bagels, hard boiled eggs, cereals, juices and more. The staff from the room attendants to the front desk clerks were terrific. They always greeted you with a smile and \"hello\". I accidentally left my keys in my room safe, they fell out of my purse and the safe was on the top shelf of the closet so since I'm of average height I didn't realize they were there. We realized we didn't have them when we were on the terminal bus back to the parking area at the airport. We called The Inn and spoke to Mark and he was more than happy to check the room safe and called us back within a few minutes and said it would be no problem sending them to us-- we got them Fed Ex priority the next day---Now thats customer service!!!!

Price: Great price... i got a great room for around $150/night when most other nicer hotels in the Union Sq area were double that. 3. Very comfortable rooms: while the room was small, it had a very comfortable bed, great lines, newly redone bathroom and Free Wi-fi throughout the hotel. 4. Character: I realize that the building is old, but that creates some of the character. I would prefer to stay in a hotel like this with some style than the standard, generic Hiltons/Marriotts in each city. 4. Nice staff: very professional and courteous staff The only small issue... Parking cost $40/day which is tough to swallow, but par for the course in San Fran. I travel a lot and have stayed in many hotels... this was as good as any (shy of the ritz or 4 seasons) and i would definitely stay at this or other Kimpton hotels again.

Then again, we only paid $149 which is a bargain given the location. We stayed for 10 days and booked an Internet special. Our room (5th floor) was fine and included a king-sized bed, two nightstands, arm chair and ottoman, armoir with TV, and desk and chair...all Georgian style. There are other updated rooms that have more modern features. Ours, however, were in good shape. Bathroom had tub/shower (great water pressure), toilet and sink with marble counter. It's on the small side for most American tourists, but we're used to traveling in Europe and found the size just fine...particularly for the small amount of time we spent there. A few quirks to be aware of: the hotel is extremely narrow, meaning our two windows overlooked some air exchange units to other buildings in the block. It could be quite loud, but it actually became like white noise, blocking out the various sirens and sounds of the city. We had our windows open the whole time, and the breeze was delightful. We lucked out and had sun and 65 degrees for our entire trip making for perfect sleeping weather. The location of the hotel can't be beat, and in fact, a few locals who were with us on the Supershuttle from the airport remarked such. The hotel is bordered by Farallon, an excellent seafood restaurant, and Morton's, a steakhouse. Borders is in the same block, as is a Walgreen's for those misc items you forgot. The cable car stops right in front of Borders, but you will have better luck walking the three/four blocks to the Powell station to catch them when they turn around. During the week was a minimal wait - weekends were nuts. The hotel also has great restaurants around it - Scala's Bistro, Postrio, Kuleto's are within a block or so. If you're a shopper, there are numerous high-end stores all around Union Square. The other perks of breakfast and evening treats have been mentioned in prior posts. Same was true for us: quite generous morning breakfast, though it seemed to be a slow time at the hotel, meaning we had to go down to the third floor to get it. There are small lounges at the end of each floor but depending on how full the hotel was, sometimes breakfast was served there, sometimes just on 3rd....no big deal. Each morning included coffee, freshly squeezed OJ, granola and raisin bran, various donuts or quick breads, bagels, hard boiled eggs, yogurt. You can either eat there or bring back a tray to your room. Sometimes there were folks who wanted to chat, and depending on our mood we either chatted or just got a tray. You can feel free to do either. The San Fran Chronicle was delivered to our door each day except for Sunday which you had to pay for at the front desk - just a buck, I think. Evening hors'doeuvres were three different cheeses (brie, blue, and swiss), crackers, dried fruit, chocolates, and either chardonnay or cab sauv. Although breakfast was quite generous, the evening snacks were a bit chintzy and you had to get there early to score any cheese. Again, we usually took a tray back to the room, though we did have a couple nice chats with some folks from Britain and Pittsburgh. The staff was quite pleasant, though their concierge services could be improved. We asked advice on car rental agencies and could have used a heartier endorsement, instead of the bland \"any are fine\" response. Housekeeping folks were incredibly helpful - more so than front office staff....though, again, all were pleasant and remembered you when you came back at the end of the day. All in all, this place is an incredible value, best for folks who appreciate the location and comfort and niceties. If you're expecting the Ritz-Carlton and will settle for nothing less, look somewhere else. If the things I describe appeal to you, you won't be disappointed.
