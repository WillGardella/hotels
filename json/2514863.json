We did not try breakfast as our flight was so early, but the hotel was very clean and tidy. The bedroom was small, but great bed, and massive clean bathroom. They also emailed a few times with updates on renovation work they are doing recently - which I kind of liked. Would i use again? If the price was alright it would be my FIRST choice.

We had a lovely room with a small balcony. Breakfast room is tiny, but still lovely. The staff is extremely friendly and will make you feel right at home. It was a bit too far out for us; we probably will choose a hotel closer to Notre Dame in the future, but for many people, the quietness of this area would be perfect. There were several small shops within walking distance and an Italian Restaurant that we ate in several evenings. But, it IS quite a distance from much of anything. Probably good for a couple that has visited Paris several times and just wants a quiet neighborhood.

I had to keep my suitcase beside my bed near the window. The closet was approximately 3 feet wide with shelves. The closet was just inside the door to the room. There was no light, so it was impossible to see what I had put in the closet without taking it to the window. The closet had a strange smell as well. There was a desk at the foot of both beds, if my friend was on the computer, I had to climb across both beds to get to the bathroom. I chose to have the bed nearest the window so my friend would have easy access to the bathroom.

The hotel's location was excellent as it was only about a 10 minute walk to the metro and restaurants and about a 20 minute walk to Avenue Des Champs D'Elysee.

The room also had a fridge/minibar, flatscreen TV, air con and coffee/the boiler. The hotel has a homely feel to it, but It isn't fancy. The decor is dated and looks a little bit like \"back to the -80's\", but the manager told us that the hotel will go through a total renovation from november 2011 - march 2012 (they will close the hotel), and I guess it then will be back to better shape than before.

The hotel is perfectly situated in a quiet, nice and posh residential area close to Porte Maillot (Metro line 1 and the bus station for Beauvais airport at the Congress center) and Porte Duphine (metro line 2) which is just 5-10 min walk away. The only negativ is the price of the breakfast - 13 EUR per person is way to expensive for what you get.

As a new yorker, I have become used to this. If you want to stay in Paris for under $400, or you don't want to stay at a large chain hotel, you will simply have to deal with the lack of space that comes with a high price tag. You shouldn't expect your money to buy you in Paris the same stuff it buys you in say, Ohio.if you can get over the space issues, you will grow to love this place. The staff is incredibly nice- very refreshing when you've been running around the frantic city all day. You can easily walk to a few metro stops.

So, I expected to find a nice hotel, at a reasonable price, in a convenient area, and good breakfast. I had more. The cozy and still sophisticated hotel is located in a quiet street, in what looks a pretty upscale residential quarter. You need just to go around the corner to find busy streets, full of life, shops and restaurant. This is not a tourist area (fortunately). The hotel is only ten minutes walking from the Conference Center (Palais de Congres) and so, for me and my colleague, was the perfect location. The hotel is also very close (less than 10 min walking) to the bus stop for buses to Beauvais and Charles De Gaulle. Metro station is only five minutes away. My experience with this hotel was all positive. We had a busy correspondence at the moment of booking because of certain administrative formalities. We found professional answers and commitment. On our arrival, they remembered our names and gave us exactly the kind of room we had requested. People working there are absolutely fantastic. No matter who you find at the reception, they are all professional and more than friendly. They cheer you every time you enter and look sincerely concerned about your needs. I felt like I was home. Every night when I returned to the hotel it was like going back home and find somebody that was interested about how your day had been. I would say that many guests shared my same feeling. People stopped at the small bar to enjoy a glass of wine while chatting with the other guests and also at breakfast early in the morning (I mean when everybody yawns and grunts ) hotel guests enjoyed the reciprocal company, sharing comments on the city and activities, giving advice and recommendations. It looks like the hotel has a positive influence on people or maybe positive people choose this hotel or maybe we were just lucky to meet nice people. Anyway, the result is an enjoyable place to stay. Breakfast is good.: a small buffet with high quality food and good service. The only problem is that the room is small and maybe you have to wait a little bit to be sit but it has never been a real problem during our stay. The rooms are not big, but well furnished and with a modern well equipped bathroom (fantastic shower, by the way, and this is sometimes a luxury in a 3-star hotel). Free WiFi internet. What\u2019s more my colleague had to leave for personal reasons earlier than expected and she had no problem at all when she informed the reception. They also gave us recommendations about restaurants that turned to be very enjoyable places to have lunch or dinner.

This is an extremely comfortable ,well run 3 star hotel.I would describe the rooms as whimsical and quaint - which for us was the total Paris experience.If you are looking for posh and modern this is not for you,but if you are looking for a very clean,quaint and comfortable hotel you have found it right here.Our room had 2 large windows,one in the childrens' area and one in ours - both looked over a lovely interior courtyard.While we were there the nights were cool,and we were able to leave the windows open and enjoyed a really good night's sleep.It is a very quiet,residential area - and where can you sleep in Paris and leave your window open and not be disturbed by noise? The added advantage is ,that the room does have airconditioning and we had one very hot day,and were certainly glad of the aircon then!Bathroom is a very good size,again with a large window which we appreciated after 4 people had a shower and meant that the steam could escape in seconds!I know some people have mentioned the shower curtain over the bath and that the floor flooded when they took a shower,but to be honest it wasn;t a problem for us and just added to our \"french experience\".The towels are absolutely fabulous - large,soft and fluffy!Breakfast was included in our rate and we found the little breakfast area delightful.We never had a problem getting a table and the coffee was very good ,as was the hot chocolate for the children.We enjoyed the pastries,but if it had not been included in our room rate,I would probably find 13euro per person x4 a little pricey.As literally every other reviewer has said,the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful.From the moment we arrived ,to the moment we departed we felt they genuinely wanted us to have a wonderful stay in Paris.They welcomed us every morning with friendly smiles,asked us how we slept and how we were going to spend the day.Their restaurant suggestions are excellent and we had a fabulous meal in the congres de maillot.highly recommended!The Metro with children ,is about an 8 minute walk (without children it is faster!),so we did tend to take a few more taxis than anticipated.After a long day of sightseeing it seemed easier than negotiating the metro and doing another walk with the children.Most taxi fares were around 10 euro (from the eiffel tower) which to us was well worth it.There is a great little supermarket just around the corner ,where we got water and snacks.When we return to Paris,we will certainly stay here again and will recommend to our friends!", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "surrey, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Friendly Hotel\u201d", "Author": "bew212", "ReviewID": "UR116408354", "Content": "For a 3 star hotel, we could not ask for more.

I am so pleased we found Hotel Residence Foch (through TripAdvisor). Hotel rooms in Paris usually are pretty compact, so we weren't surprised that the three single beds they had put in the children's end of the family room were creatively crammed in; the point is they managed to get three beds in there, and with space to move between them, a miracle! Our room was comfortable, spacious compared to rooms I've had in other Parisian hotels. The bathroom was very nicely appointed, and spotlessly clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The first morning the children and my husband slept very late, and I went on downstairs to have a coffee. The fabulously friendly and helpful manager asked why I was alone, and then immediately offered to have four trays made up and sent to the room so the family could have breakfast when they woke. I declined the offer, but asked how it would cost to have breakfast in bed, the manager's response? 'Why madam, nothing! You have already paid for your breakfast, it is our pleasure only that you enjoy your stay.' That is the first time EVER that I have had that kind of service offered in a hotel. Would I recommend Hotel Residence Foche for families? Absolutely, and anyone else that wants a friendly and welcoming hotel to go back to after a long day of sightseeing. The hotel is small, but offers brochures, has postcards for sale in the lobby, and can give you a range of recommendations on places to see, where to eat and how to get there. Our youngest is 5 and we all walked from the hotel to the L'Arc de Triomphe and then on down to the Seine and the Eiffel Tower. It is only 5 minutes from the metro station which connects you to everything. There was a gorgeous pizzeria two minutes along the road, a chemist (pharmacy) and 5 minutes more takes you to the most amazing Lebanese restaurant whose name I forget but the lovely manager knows where it is!

I had been going to Paris at least 4 times a year, and found the only part of the experience I did not enjoy were the hotels. They were either too big, too impersonal or the language barrier was just difficult to overcome. I felt okay at the Marriott, or the other recognizable hotels, but then when you stay there you could be in Cleveland! No, I desired an experience that made me feel like I had my own house, my own family in a neighborhood (the 16th Arrondissement, it does not get any better in Paris?) that was inviting and distinctly Parisian. This is when my pal said the place to go was the Hotel Residence-Foch. A small hotel, not very expensive, with an exceptionally friendly staff and knowledgeable manger, who also was the owner(how often do you get to meet with the owner of such a highly rated hotel?) Well, since my first stay over 8 years ago, this is the only place I stay when in Paris, and I have recommended the hotel to many others, and at last count have had over 15 friends stay there and they could not thank me enough about it. This gem of a place is a treasure, and I sometimes think that if I recommend it too much, I will never be able to get a room. The savvy traveler will understand the qualities of this establishment the minute they enter. The spotlessly clean rooms, the friendly and efficient associates, and the delicious morning \"cafe and petit dejeuner,\" and as an American in Paris, I know that every time I stay there I am truly in my \"second\" home. The best proof that I know of that I am not alone, is that every time I stay at the \"RF\" as myself and my friend's refer to it, we run into someone we met in previous visits. There is just one of manyreasons this hotel has been rated one of best in Paris for several years, because it is.

We chose to walk everywhere we went (everything was in walking distance), but if you are opposed to walking around the city, there is an underground station just about a block away. Also, keep in mind when staying at this hotel that the elevator is small and only takes you to the 5th floor (I think it's the 5th) and then you have to walk up the remaining flights of stairs with your luggage if you are on the 6th or 7th floor. We didn't mind! We even had a view of the Eiffel Tower from our little balcony! The temperature in the room was also very comfortable, as there was a little wall unit air conditioner. Finally, I have to mention the other concierge as being excellent, though I never did catch his name! Overall, STAY HERE!

We got into our bags up the lift in and found our suite (the Blue Room) incredibly SPACIOUS and well appointed. While we were lucky with the weather and didn't have to make use of A/C or heat, we did leave windows open during the night. And, remarkably, it was pitch quiet and very indicative of how residential the neighborhood (the 16th A) is despite its proximity to l'Arc de Triomphe and major boulevards. The beds, including an additional cot set up, were very comfortable with good linens. Bathroom was very roomy, especially for Paris. And,one of my hotel pet peeves was absent: there was really good lighting in the room. Enough lamp options throughout the space for one person to go to sleep and someone else to stay up and read. It's not a luxurious space, but it's one that feels authentic to the city while also being modern with free wi-fi and a flat screen TV. Located in the 16th A., the location is remarkably convenient midway between the Porte Maillot (Metro line 1) and Porte Dauphine (Metro line 2). Breakfast is a bit pricey at 13 euros per person, especially when there are some nice patesseries within walking distance. But, the breakfast spread and atmosphere is very nice and convenient. The most unique and strongest asset of this hotel is its service. The lovely couple who took care of us were helpful with recommendations, suggestions, and helping to book our taxi when we left.

The hotel also has an offer for dinner in a nearby restaurant on Rue Pergolese (set menu with wine - but for almost half the price you would pay normally) The staff of Residence Foch must again be commended for their manner and helpfulness; they even rang ahead to confirm a reservation and obtain directions for us to go for dinner on the Seine one of the nights.

The hotel was really great and for the price we felt like we got an awesome deal. Location: The hotel is halfway between two metro stops, Porte Dauphine (Blue Line) and Porte Malliot (Yellow Line). The Yellow Line goes through most of the major tourist areas, like the Louvre, Tulleries, etc. It was very easy to use the Metro as most of the time we did not need to transfer lines at all! The Blue Line goes up to Monmartre which was also convienent. The hotel is about a 5 - 7 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe, and about a 20 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower. The hotel is on a quite side street near the German embassy, so the area is secure. Services: Yes, the rooms are small. The Standard room that we booked (130 euros with breakfast) was adequate for our needs. The bed, two doubles, formed a king but there was only a narrow alleyway on either side of the bed. The only other complaint I had was that the bathroom was just on the other side of a pocket door, which made using the facilities uncomfortable at times as the room and the bathroom were so close. However, the bathroom was large by European standards (it was MUCH larger than the one we had in Amsterdam at a luxury hotel). The hotel desk staff were wonderful, answered all our questions, helped us with our French, and genuniely cared about whether or not we were having a good time. They helped us find provisions for a pic-nic at the Eiffel Tower, lent us glassware, a tray and a knife, and offered us menus for local restaurants. They even have ideas about what tours you should do each day, if asked. Free wi-fi, two laptops, and free printing were really helpful during our stay. Breakfast: Breakfast was a typical european fare, with croissants, breads, yogurts, cereal, juices, tea, coffee, etc. There was plenty of food to go around, and we were always able to find a table and were asked for our beverage preferences right away. The only complaint I have is that the mini bar also includes the snacks on the desk, which look \"Free\" until you find out that they are part of the mini bar! But, the 3.50 euro pringles were worth it when I was hungry at night. This hotel was a great deal for the price, but the desk staff went above and beyond.

My price was in dollars but nowhere on the Expedia receipt did it say that the final price was subject to any change. I expressed my concern with the man at the front desk saying that I had planned my trip around the price quoted to me and that I didn't have enough money on the two cards I had on the front desk. He called his manager and I spoke with him and explained the situation. Meanwhile my wife came downstairs and I left my cards on the front desk and went to ask if I could use money on her card to pay for the extra money they were charging me. When I came back to the desk, the man had taken one of my cards without my permission and had put the entire amount onto one card rather than two. I got on the phone with his manager who said that it was their right to do that and that I was not cooperating and that it was their right to take my card. Bottom line, they caused my bank to overdraft me a large amount, they treated me and my wife like criminals, and they processed my payment without any consent from me.

Info is available on the web The hotel is reasonable stroll to the Arc de Triomphe and the Gardins Tuleries down the Champs Elyseees.

During that time we stayed at 9 different hotels ranging from 3 to 5 star and I have to say that the Hotel Residence Foch stood head and shoulders above the rest. The main reason being Nelly, the owner and her wonderful staff. There was nothing that was too much trouble... From organising laundry to giving us very specific help on getting to and from various places, the team at Hotel Residence Foch were amazing. They really made us feel welcome and important! The location of the hotel is a 5 minute walk from the Arc de Triomphe away from the Champs Elysees but it is still only 20 to 25 minutes walk away from the Trocadero and is in a lovely suburban area with many brasseries and restaurants in easy reach. The metro is close by and having been too scared to catch trains last time I was in Paris, Nelly talked me through it and made it very easy. I now love the Metropolitain! Our room was clean and large for a European room but it was a family room. We had a separate area for our daughter with a heavy curtain dividing the 2 rooms. The servicing of the room was excellent and they leave more than enough amenities - shampoo etc, for all in the bathroom. Breakfast is not included and is around 13 euro which I thought was a bit expensive but it is such a pleasure to be sitting in the sunny breakfast room chatting with the staff and the food, though limited, was delicious - croissants, pastries, cereals, boiled eggs plenty of hot coffee that it was well and truly worth it. Not a bad start to the day! I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and can see why it is in the top ten of Tripadvisor's hotels in Paris. Don't expect the Georges V.

It may not be totally fair for us to review since we have not stayed in other Paris hotels to compare this to. But, there still may be some value of my family's perception of the hotel. This is a small hotel. It is on a quiet out of the way street which I think is a good thing. It is less than a 10 minute walk to the metro station. There was one unbelievable employee there named Cheti that might rate as one of the most willing to help hotel staff I have ever met. Wish he had been there during more of our trip. We had some language barrier issues with staff on duty for most of our stay. The hotel was able to recommend restaurants in the area and helped with getting taxis. All of these things were positive for us. Our issues were that the internet did not work well in the rooms, so we did have to use the laptops in the lobby. The breakfast was less than what we might have liked. Again, what they offered may be standard for Paris. We also thought the rooms and the hotel in general were a little dated and dark. It was clean and well taken care of, but just old fashioned. If you are looking for a clean place to sleep in a safe area at a reasonable price for Paris, this might be exactly what you are looking for.

Based upon the reviews of many Trip Advisor reviewers, we chose the Hotel Residence Foch. We were rewarded with a wonderful stay. From the moment we arrived, we knew the service was going to be outstanding. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel right at home. Our room, number 61, was large by Paris standards and had a small balcony. The bed was quite comfortable and housekeeping was very efficient. The bathroom was small but had a bath/shower combo with a glass curtain to keep water from being sprayed all over the bathroom. Each floor had its own wifi signal. Even though we were on the sixth floor, the fifth floor signal came in the strongest to my iPod. There is a small elevator that stops between the fifth and sixth floors, with an easy ten step climb to the landing for our room. The hotel is very nice but it's the staff that makes it outstanding. Nelly and her staff, especially Chedi and Isabelle made our stay so wonderful. Chedi was very helpful with dining reservations and transportation advice and always had a cheerful \"bonjour\" at our coming and going. Nelly is the heart of the hotel. She takes a personal interest in each one of her guests and would feel personally responsible if any of them had a bad experience. My wife had a minor medical problem and had to stay in the room two of the days we were there. Nelly personally delivered tea to the room with her kind best wishes. The neighborhood is very safe, probably not coincidentally because the German Embassy is at the end of the block. There are many restaurants nearby, including a small Chinese/Thai restaurant, Italian (Del Papa), Chez George, Saint Ferdinand, Le Congres and others Chedi recommended that we didn't have a chance to try. Also nearby is a small market, a patisserie, fromagerie and boulangerie. If you need a bank, there is a BNP Paribas several blocks away. Transportation is also close by; the bus is 2-3 blocks away and the Metro 8 or so blocks. We easily walked to Roland Garros, the Marmottan, the Champs Elysees and Bois de Bologne. We spent a wonderful nine nights here and I thank all Trip Advisors who recommended this hotel to us. If you need to stay in the heart of Paris, this hotel will be a little far out for you, although the number 1 Metro line is close by and stops at or near many of the most popular attractions. However, if you are willing to sacrifice being in the middle of everything for a quiet, safe neighborhood and a very comfortable hotel with the best service you'll find in Paris at a very reasonable price, by all means stay at the Hotel Residence Foch!!!", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cAn Excellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "meirn", "ReviewID": "UR65874538", "Content": "The hotel is located 5 minutes from the main line of Metro, in a quite & safe neighbourhood.

Our room was at the back over looking the garden. The breakfast in very nice and enough to fill you up for a day sight seeing. My other half doesn't normally like breakfast but even he liked it. It is a little bit out of the main drag but an easy stroll from the Metro station. We walked from the hotel down to the Arc De Triumphe which was a short pleasant walk. Lovely also to eat around the corner (ask at reception for the restaurant with the 37 Euro fixed price menu - for Paris prices you can't beat it!) After dinner we strolled down to see the Arc de Triumphe all lit up - very romantic!!

I wanted a room with a balcony as I'm a smoker, and so I booked a deluxe double for \u20ac180, including wifi. The owner gave a very friendly welcome, and assigned me to room 71 - at the top of the building, and apparently his favourite room. the tiny lift rattled up to the 6th floor, and I had to continue up the stairs from there. It's worth noting that perhaps half the rooms in this hotel can only be accessed by climbing or descending some stairs due to the lift depositing you midway between floors - worth considering if you are less mobile or have lots of baggage. The room itself was large by Paris standards, with a good-sized bathroom. Decor was quaint, and certainly more interesting than a chain hotel. Furnishings were of reasonable quality and a small desk was available. Entertainment consists of a small flat-screen TV, but no radio or alarm clock. Balcony was big enough for a couple of chairs and a table, and the whole room overlooked the quiet courtyard. My only complaint about the room was the lack of a proper shower. Instead it was bathtaps with a shower head connected - no hook to hang the shower head, and no curtain. I really don't understand why hotels do this - surely it just means the floor getting drenched every morning?? But for this, I may have given the hotel 5 stars. There was a good selection of newspapers both morning and evening, and breakfast was fine if a little limited - no hot food, unless you want to boil your own eggs. Overall a nice enough experience - well situated for my work, and at only 5 minutes' walk from a line 1 metro station, ideal for a tourist stay in a quiet and safe neighbourhood.

The hotel is located in a side street close the route 1 & 2 metro links, which can be used for access to the centre of Paris or the North of Paris, where the Gare du Nord Eurostar station is situated. The location is not too bad and sits close to a number of embassies so you know the security will be pretty good. The area feels pretty safe. We booked a stay based on the reviews in TripAdvisor and paid just Euro90 for one night (room only). The last time we were in Paris we stayed in a hotel that was nearly Euro300 per night so was expecting a huge difference. To be honest the room was a little on the small side but is was clean and had a TV, kettle, safe (free to use) and a powerful shower !!!! The bed was comfortable, quite wide (compared to some hotels) and extra bedding was available in the wardrobe. We did not eat in the hotel but there was a small restaurant next to the reception on the ground floor. We stayed on the first floor at the front of the building facing the road. Despite this, noise was not a problem as the street is not particularly busy. Access to all floors is by stairs or lift (big enough for two with luggage). The staff in the hotel are very good (especially Chedi on the reception desk during the day) and have lots of tips and ideas for you to consider for your stay. In fact, unlike some other hotels, you get a sense that the reception staff really care about making sure you sample the very best of the city. There is nothing bad to report at this hotel. To be honest, for the price, you can't really go wrong with booking this hotel.

Nelly and her team understand that the key thing that makes for a good hotel (basics things being covered of course!) is how they treat you as a person. If you stay here, you feel like you are a truly valued guest. For those who understand customer relationships, you will appreciate the eye contact, the smile, the walking out from behind the counter (to remove the barrier), the question \"is everything OK?' whenever they see you. The practical advice is simply tremendous and the help we received from Chadi in planning our 3 day stay was simply superb and really made us get the best from our break. The room was very good - a bit on the small side, but generous for Paris. Everything was clean and in good order and there was plenty of space to hang up clothes etc. A few practical tips - and if Nelly and the team are reading this then please take this as constructive comment! 1. Unless you eat a lot for breakfast, then its much easier to go to the Pattiserie at the corner of Rue Pergolese and Malakoff (a two minute walk) where they sell wonderful Butter Croissants for 1 Euro and also have a counter service for coffee (at 1.50 Euro a cup). My suggestion to the hotel - have an \"Express Breakfast\" option of Coffee and One Croissant for say 5 Euros and the \"full help youself service\" for 13 Euro. 2. Do not use the map that's currently featured on the hotel's web site - you will get lost! I'd suggest you use google maps but most importantly of all as you arrive at the Port Dauphine Metro station DO NOT leave the platform without checking that the entrance you are about to take is for \"Bd de l'Admiral Bruix\". Leave by any other exit and you will be in trouble! If you are travelling to Port Maillot leave by the \"Malakoff\" exit (again check when you are still on the platform). 3. Don't expect to be able to watch CNN - the connection keeps breaking up. Bloomberg is just fine though. One very minor point \"BBC Entertainment\" (the lst of the 3 English langiage channels) is no good if you are from the UK as its full or repeats about 4 years old. BBC World or BBC News would be a better bet - but hey, who spends much time in their hotel room with so many wonderful sights and restaurants around!

There are many cute hotels in Paris but this one is special because of its owner and staff. You are instantly charmed by its warm and personable staff as much as the attractive surroundings. The hospitality comes from the heart and that's what makes it exceptional. We felt at ease and comfortable there while visiting Paris with our two children (13 and 11). HRF is tucked away in a posh-but-reserved neighborhood of city apartments and embassies. It is a short walk to Metro and the Ave des Grandes Armees (the Champs Elysee west of Arc de Triomphe). It has all the advantages of access while not being in the center. Paris is a very walkable city and this is as good a base. We walked all the way to Notre Dame. The Eiffel Tower is close, too. Our room (#30) was adequate size (large by European standards) and afforded a courtyard view. It was well-stocked and clean, had TV, WiFi, duvets, glasses, and minibar. The bath was large, having a tub with shower, large sink, toilet and bidet. The beds were very good. Breakfast was included for us. We found it delicious; considerably more generous than the standard continental breakfast. Breads, croissants, jams, cheeses, cereals, fresh fruits, eggs, yogurt, juices, coffee, tea, and more. It was constantly replenished and the tables were very clean. We ate like gluttons. We did not feel rushed. Jean-Louis and staff are the heart of this extremely capable operation. Every question, request, and special accommodation was cheerfully tackled. They even helped me resolve a mobile phone problem. We booked based on the rave Trip Advisor reviews. We did not go wrong.

I don't know why other reviews said its location is good as it's about 10 minutes walk to the metro. Also, this hotel is more like a bed and breakfast to me. We had a lot of luggages, and were hoping to have someone to help us. But we had to help ourselves. In the room, it's relatively big for Paris standard but the paint is chipping and the carpet was coming off and the light fixture was not being fixed.. The bathtub was clogged. We watched CNN for the whole duration of our stay and it was on and off.. the signal wasn't good as well as the internet connection. We wanted to switch hotel but didn't do it as we had too many luggages and since it was in a residential area, no taxi was avaiable and also the internet connection was so slow that we couldn't search for hotel. When we came home, I looked at a nearby hotel (think it was Best western). The rate was 170 Euro for a triple room and breakfast included. And even closer to metro. A decent hotel makes or break your vacation. I thought 200 Euro should at least be able to get a more modern room but ended up with huge disappointment.

Everyone was incredibly friendly, nice and helpful. The hotel and rooms were beautifully decorated, very French, in yellows and red. There were beautiful stain glass window panels facing the elevator on every floor. The walls were sponge painted and stenciled - everything done with care and taste. The bathroom was completely tiled and quite a good size. There was a hair dryer, iron and ironing board, shampoo, shower cap etc - all the nice little extras, as well as gear to make coffee or tea in the morning. The drapes on the window were lovely, as were the prints on the walls, beautifully framed with multiple mats. The hotel is a perfect size - not too big. There were 6 floors, with only a handful of rooms on each floor. As others have mentioned, our room, though delightful, was quite small (judging from the floorplan we had the smallest room on the floor.) The bed took up most of the room! However, this wasn't a big deal as we spent most of our time out and about the city. One thing we definitely appreciated was that the room and hotel was very quiet. We slept well. :-) Residence Foch is located in a pleasant, residential section of Paris, which is an enjoyable walk after escaping the crowds on the Champs-Elysees. When arriving in Paris, we took the Air France bus from CDG airport to Port Maillot, and from there it was an easy walk to the hotel. The #1 and #2 metro lines are both close to the hotel so it's very easy to get all around Paris - although walking is a great way to enjoy the city! All in all, we had a wonderful time at the Residence Foch and were very impressed with how everyone bent over backward to be helpful and friendly. This ambiance certainly enhanced our trip to Paris!

Its close to metro stops on line 1 and 2 which mean its easy to get around and there is even a Velib bike station on Rue de Malakoff just around the corner, so if you chose to use the bike system you are able to ride home! We recommend this hotel highly to anyone who is thinking of visiting Paris and we will be returning ourselves. We also did a bike tour with http://www.bikeabouttours.com/ which we really enjoyed \u2013 even if you are a frequent visitor in Paris it would be enjoyable as you get to see so much of the city.

For evening meals when we asked if there were any good restaurants in the area, we were again asked what our preferences were before they made recommendations. Once we'd decided ,the hotel made the reservations. Each evening when we returned to the hotel, the staff aked how our day went and what we'd like to do tomorrow.

Anyone that says that the French are rude...our sorely mistaken. They were more friendly than many places I have been in the US. Like other reviews, I would say that this was in a perfect location, still close to everything by metro, but away from the crowds. It's located on a quiet street in a residential area. We felt very safe walking around. Just around the corner from this hotel, you can find a small market and one of the best chocolate shops we came across. If you are thinkng of coming to Paris, I would recommend not renting a car, but taking the metro everywhere. There is limited parking and driving is intense. We were unsure of the metro and RER, having never used it before but found it so easy and fast and flexible. Also definately buy a museum pass! We did spend a day at EuroDisney and loved it! Not as big or grand as the parks in the states, but very fun! We are big Mickey fans and it was nice to break up the week with a little fun! The only downside to this little gem is the beds. They are very firm. If you like that, than you'll rest well. Room number one, as previously mentioned, is right next to the kitchen, so I would definately recommend asking for a room that is off the main floor. I would find this bothersome as well.

There isn't much close to the hotel so expect a little walk for dinner. The room we stayed in was one of the cleanest we have ever stayed which is a big plus for me. The only disappointment was the size of our room, when we arived we were told there were no more doubles so they had given us an extra large bed. This actually meant 2 singles pushed together (although there was a single sheet etc over the two). Anyway, if you don't mind not sleeping near your partner this is fine but for us it generally meant one of us was stuck in the dip - not very comfortable! The room was also pretty pokey - looking at the fire exit floor plan we had the smallest room on the floor (the other rooms are much larger so ask to move if you get a small one). There wasn't really much room to move around the bed and very little room for baggage (lucky we were only vsiting for the weekend and not as part of a tour of france or we would have been in trouble).

There is a little shop around the corner that sells most things you might need and a very nice partisserie five minutes walk the other way to buy your lunch if you want to picnic. There are also lots of restaurants/cafes nearby. Port Maillot, ten minutes away, has a large indoor shopping centre but we didnt have time to visit it. I think parking near to the hotel might be difficult due to restrictions because of embassy security, ring before you book and enquire if you intend travelling by car.

The girls had studied French in school, but are far from fluent. this was NOT a problem, even when we veered away from the tourist areas into the parts of Paris where the locals shop and eat (which we did several times). The Parisians were always helpful and considerate once they realized we did not speak French very well. I started off working with a travel agent who tried to convince me that we would be best served by a private tour company that wanted to charge us HUGE amounts of money for guided tours. That was not an option financially,and with the help of Chedi and the other front desk staff at the hotel we managed to see much more of Paris than we could have imagined. Upon arriving at the hotel mid-morning Chedi recommended we go up to our room, shower and change, then gave us an itinerary for the rest of the day that would rival any tour guide's plan. We stayed in one of the family rooms,and had ample space. The room was beautifully decorated as well as extremely comfortable. It was the blue room on the hotel website, and was exactly as pictured. The neighborhood is residential and quiet, and an easy walk to the Eiffel Tower, Arc of Triumph, groceries, restaurants, metro and RER. Possibly the more expensive, big name hotels in the city can offer you more \"luxury\", but if you want to really immerse yourself into the Parisian lifestyle and feel like you are the most important clients at the hotel, I highly recommend Residence Foch.", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201cThey deserve an award\u201d", "Author": "Paranoid27", "ReviewID": "UR34377675", "Content": "I stayed in the hotel Residence Foch for 4 nights while at the World Congress of Gerontology.

I e-mailed the hotel with questions about tours, places to see, distances, etc., and someone at the desk always wrote me immediately with the information that I needed. I especially enjoyed corresponding and talking with Chedi before our arrival. And this wonderful hospitality continued on our entire visit of 9 days!! We were greeted by the nicest people - they served us coffee when we arrived. Nelly, the owner, is the friendliest, most cheerful, and most helpful person that we have met. Each morning she would help us with our plans - giving us wonderful ideas of what to do and see. It rained most days that we were there, and the one sunny day that we were planning to go to the Louvre, she suggested that we enjoy the beautiful sunshine and go somewhere outdoors. We went to Versailles that day, and were so happy that we did!! Chedi continued to be as helpful as he had been before our visit. And in the evening, we especially enjoyed visiting with Youssef, who was so nice!! What a lovely staff! We prefer B&B's rather than large hotels, and this was perfect - so charming. We had a very pleasant room that overlooked the street. It was decorated nicely and was very clean. The hotel is in a great location - close to two metro stops, a train station, and a gorgeous park where my husband ran each morning. We felt safe coming home at night. It is a very pleasant walk to the Arc de Triomphe - and a nice walk to the Eiffel Tower, where you must have coffee and croissants at Carette at the Trocadero. We actually walked to and from most places in Paris. We did take the metro a few times - when it was raining, when we went to Montmartre, and when we went to mass at Notre Dame on Sunday morning. We did walk back from Notre Dame, and the Latin Quarter - it is a great city to walk around!! There are wonderful restaurants right near the hotel. Our favorites that were recommended by the hotel are Bistro Saint Ferdinand, Chez Georges and L'Auberge Dab. The food and service at those restaurants was excellent. One of our favorite restaurants was one that we saw while we were eating across the street at Chez Georges. It is Le Relais de Venise \"Son Entrecote\" on Blvd. Pereire near Porte Maillot. When we came out of Chez Georges one night we saw a long line around the corner, and we went over to see what was happening. The people were in line to go to dinner at this little restaurant. They told us that it is very popular with locals. It has a set menu of salad, meat and french fries - with the most delicious meat sauce! I don't even eat that much meat, but we decided to try it, and it was one of the highlights!! The sauce is to die for - and the waitress comes back and gives seconds on everything! The layered chocolate dessert was absolutely delicious! It was a great experience. We also went to the dinner show at the Moulin Rouge one night. Chedi called and made reservations for us. It had been recommended by other guests at the hotel, as well as our friend who lives in Montmartre. It was so spectacular - as good as any Broadway Show - and the dinner was excellent!! We can't say enough about how much we loved our stay. Paris is absolutely gorgeous - one of our favorite cities - and staying at the very charming Hotel Residence Foch made it just perfect!!

The gentleman gave us a map of Paris and quickly circled the main attractions and highlighted the routes so we could find our way around. We had booked a deluxe double room after viewing the website as we believed that if those rooms were more expensive they would come under the 'superior quality' heading. The room we were given was definitely not superior quality; but in saying that it was generally what we might expect from a three star hotel. (The website makes the hotel look four or five star.) The room had a reasonable amount of space around the large bed, a chest of drawers, a small cupboard, iron and ironing board, TV, tea and coffee making, an ensuite and Juliet balcony. My husband wanted to smoke on the balcony, but found it a little daunting as it seemed to lean (perhaps an optical illusion?). The bed was comfortable, but you could feel the join in the centre where they had obviously pushed two smaller beds together. It was also quite low to the ground, which definitely took away some of the appeal. Some of the tiles in the bathroom were cracked, and the ceiling in the bedroom needed some repair, but otherwise it was clean, quiet and in a good location. Breakfast was Continental and 13 Euro (around $24 Australian). Cereal, boiled eggs, juice, coffee, croissants, rolls, cheeses etc. I asked for toast on the first morning (had even learned how to say it in French), but was told they don't serve it. That was a little disappointing. The breakfast room itself was charming, with nice tablecloths and place settings, and overlooked a small garden. There was a sitting room with magazines and a laptop with free internet access. I managed to send a short email there one day, but it took me forever as the keyboard is slightly different to the Aussie one with letters in different places. Oh well, can't have everything :). There were quite a few good restaurants quite close by (wine prices quite high) and there were two Metro stations (different lines) within easy walking distance.

This did not surprise us as Nelly and Isabelle answered all of our correspondence promptly and with every attempt to meet all of our requirements. No request was too much for them to address. We were a group of six adults for part of our stay and for the second part another group of friends joined us. Coordinating the accommodations for all members of our party was handled with seeming ease on the part of the staff. Jean Louis with his genuine smile and quickness made each morning a delight. He answered questions, arranged for transfers to the train station, called museums, recommended excellent restaurants and did all of the things an attentive concierge would do. His happiness infected us with joy and he makes a stay at the Residence Foch an experience that makes one feel at home, albeit with a personal staff! Wasuf and ____ attended our every need, as well , from explaining the use of the house computer, to bartending and sharing dishes with us when we brought home desserts from dinner. If you are looking for competent, gracious people to enhance your time in Paris, we gratefully recommend the staff at Residence Foch. Our room, one of the family suites, and we would encourage booking these, included a sitting area, a bedroom with very comfortable mattresses and a large ensuite bathroom. Each room includes television, phone service and a stocked mini-bar. Smaller rooms in the hotel include these same amenities. With the friendly ambiance of Residence Foch even these are recommended. Because our stay was divided into two parts, we stayed in two different family suites and in both the coordinated walls and linens added to the beauty. Because of a garden on the lowest floor, we dealt with mosquitos a few nights, because we slept with windows open. The few times that we needed air conditioning, it worked perfectly. We cannot say enough about the location. About four blocks from Porte Maillot and one block from the Grande Armee, the Residence Foch is situated on Rue Marbeau, a quiet street in the 17th arrondisement, where several embassies are located. About three blocks from the restaurant we found an excellent boulangerie/patisserie for croissants and coffee and afternoon snacks as well as numerous fine restaurants and brasseries. After a day of sightseeing, it felt wonderful returning to the hotel to freshen up and then, be able to go to restaurants nearby that served delicious meals.

Nelly Rolland is the owner of this 25 room hotel (beautiful building) and has a lot of pride in her hotel. She has earned the excellent rating from trip advisor.

There are restaurants, supermarkets, boulangeries, etc. in the immediate area. The hotel is very nicely decorated and has a pleasant, \u201cfresh\u201d look about it.

Our room was very nice, a big bed (actually two twins put together), with a very nice modern, large bathroom, by Parisian standards. The best quality of this small hotel, however, is the staff. They are very enthousiastic, and are very willing to go out of their way to assist you in every way possible, without being intrusive. I will definitely stay at this hotel again!

The hotel is situated on a short, narrow street, next to the United Arab Emirates embassy and at the far end of the street from the German embassy. As an ex-pat living in France, I think that the location and accommodations combine to give you a taste of what it would be like to actually live in Paris, among its most well-to-do denizens...complete with servants who are at your disposal. Given the location, be prepared to walk. Then again, if you're not prepared to walk, you probably aren't up for a getaway to Paris in the first place. You're very close to the Arc de Triomphe and a handful of restaurants and brasseries. There's a wonderful park nearby if you're jonesing for a stroll away from the press of tourists. And Il Trocadero...and the Tour Eiffel are a spirited walk from the hotel, which is actually more like a high end bed and breakfast with its individually decorated rooms and small but excellent staff. Prior to making our reservations, we had read here on TripAdvisor that the hotel is a short walk from the Metro...and it's true: it's actually a pleasant stroll. But if you've got luggage, as we did, it's a real hassle. At the very least, if you take the 1 train through Paris to the hotel, make sure that you depart from the rear of the train and save yourself many intersections and at least one round on your way to the hotel. The service at the front desk was exceptional. The staff was highly attentive. We booked two rooms and they made sure we were close together.

Blue line of metro will take you right up to the Sacre Couer, Montmartre & Red Light locations (Anvers stop, blue line \"2\"). If you enjoy to walk, hotel is only a couple blocks to the Arc & Champs Elysee (take the Avenue Foch). Staff/Features: Hotel staff is superb, providing 24 hour customer service. They all speak english fluently. The owner is a very nice woman who is more than helpful. The staff provides valuable suggestions/brochures to main attractions & local restaurants ( I used to live 2 metro stops from the hotel location and I love the area). There is internet service in the main lobby as well as a laptop for your use. Some rooms provide service, I believe, but check which rooms. Price: I found this hotel to be reasonably priced (well worth what you receive from the hotel). At the time we took our vacation, the hotel was rated #9 of 100 on TripAdvisor. You can look up prices through TripAdvisor when you click on the hotel's information. TripAdvisor will provide you with multiple different discount sites to choose the best rate. Food/Bar: Breakfast (fruit, croissants, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, coffee, tea, etc.) is served buffet style for approx. 13 euros. Worth it to us since we did not want to hunt down a boulangerie or sit in a restaurant for an hour (if we had more time, than possibly). There is also a bar in the hotel lobby that is open at all hours (however, no one ever uses it according to the staff). We stayed in a room above the lobby and we did not hear anyone downstairs. For dinner the hotel suggested a wonderful Italian restaurant around the corner, \"Del Papa\". Rooms: Rooms range from standard to deluxe (even between the two types of rooms there is a range). If you are tall, request a large bed (6'7\" person slept comfortably). We stayed in room 14 on the second floor. Space was not huge for this room but it was a very nice room. There is a safe in the closets to protect any valuables & coffee/tea kettle in your room. I did not find an AC unit in the room but you can open the tall windows to receive some fresh air. You can hear a little bit of noise to the room adjacent to yours but I'm a pretty light sleeper & the noise didn't wake me up. Location: If you fly into Beauvais (RyanAir flights), the bus drops you at the city depot which is located within 4 blocks of the hotel. On the hotel website, they will provide directions & a map on how to reach the hotel from the other airport. I just provided Beauvais info b/c the hotel directions said \"Use Public Transportation\". Metro/Bus:From the hotel, the closest metro lines are Porte Dauphine (end of blue line \"2\") & Porte Maillot (yellow line \"1\"). The hotel will provide you a city map with the train and metro lines. We walked to the Champs Elysee and took the tour bus \"Les Cars Rouges\" (red tour bus) that stops at all the main sites. If you are visiting for a short time, I highly suggest taking one of these buses b/c you are able to see a lot more instead of jumping on and off the metro. The tour bus I suggested you can hop on/off for two days and the closest stop to the hotel is \"Etoile\". It's a double decker bus (great for all those photo takers). I found this bus stops at all the attractions except for Montmartre/Sacre-Couer (just have to take 1 metro line but get ready to walk up some stairs). Tour Suggestion: On a seperate note, if you have the chance to take a boat ride down the Seine, I highly recommend this. I used to take visitors on a boat ride at night b/c the city's attractions are very different at night (Concorde, Notre Dame, Eiffel Tour). We hopped on a boat near the Eiffel Tour at 7 p.m. and we were able to see the Eiffel Tour lit up with the European Union stars and color. Also, extra treat is seeing the Eiffel Tour at 8 p.m. (probably on the hour when it's dark) b/c it sparkles for a couple minutes.

TV had about 20 channels everything from sports to movies to sit coms - but of course you're in paris so I don't know how much TV watching you should be doing. They also have a laundry service but there are dry cleaners in the neighbourhood. There is also a butcher, grocery store, bakery all within 5 minute walking distance of the hotel. There is a computer in the lobby with internet which is free to use to check your email or surf the net. The hotel is near Foche and Ave de la Grande Armee both of which lead to the Arc de Triomph. The walk is about 10 minutes to the Arc and from there you can walk (or take the metro but really you should walk..) down Champ Elysees, maybe cut across Montaigne (as far as I can tell this is where all the high fashion stores are), across the Seine to the Eifell Tower and then along the Seine to anything else you want to see.... The hotel has breakfast which I had one day. In most cafes you can get breakfast for about 5-6 euros maybe a little more and this will include a hot drink, a croissant, juice, half a baguette, butter and jam. The hotel breakfast is more expensive but you have a wider choice of jams, honey, nutella, cereal, different pastries and so on.

Residence Foch has a classic look that is charmingly French without the over the top scarey, flowery decor that so many Paris hotels seem to have (hmmm, red stripey wall paper matched with lurid florals - not my cup of tea thankyou!). I requested the \"blue room\" when I booked and this wonderful hotel obliged by allocating us the 7th floor room with balcony views of the Eiffel Tower. All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and were always cheery and willing to encourage our pathetic attempts at speaking french! My only concern - having not been to Paris before - was that the location seemed a bit out the way. A poster on another forum gave me the advice to \"choose a hotel you like and don't worry too much about the location as nothing is very far away in Paris\". What good advice - with 2 Metro stations and an RER stop close by the location was never a hinderance during out stay. After spending a few days visiting some of the crowded attractions it was nice to come back to our quieter area each night.

The side street that the hotel is located on is a one way street with cars parked on both sides of the street and only space for 1 car traffic in the middle. There was no where to stop except for the garage driveway of the home next door. We stopped there temporarily to unload our baggage and the homeowner came out and started to scream at us in French that we could not park their although all we were doing was unloading our luggage. Then when we went to park the car, we had to go about 5 blocks away to finally find a parking area. We had to walk back to the hotel through the isolated streets at night. We had no way of knowing if it was safe, but we did not encounter anyone on our walk back to the hotel so everything worked out. In conclusion, if you drive your own car, this hotel is not the most ideal one for you, if not, then it's a great hotel for the money considering the prices in Paris and its ideal location.", "Date": "May 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cWho says the French aren't friendly?\u201d", "Author": "Inverloch", "ReviewID": "UR16163179", "Content": "No doubt there are many lovely little hotels in Paris but the Residence Foch is not only all that, but has that important element that makes a \"nice\" hotel a great one.

Not many hotels in the locality, more apartments for the locals and not too many typical tourists. We actually felt like we were in Paris not in an international locality competing with other tourists. Quite inspiring. Yet located in a nice part of town not far, walking distance in fact, from the Arc De Triomphe What we didn't expect was the ambiance, warmth and friendliness that you experienced within moments of entering. Nothing was a problem, directions, restaurants, places of interest, no matter what we seeked assistance for they delivered, without exception, and with a smile. You actually felt comfortable not foreign, which we value particularly when your stay is usually for only a few days. Breakfast was enjoyable, everything fresh and French. The cost was comparable to many other hotels in this range, very reasonable for the style and location.

We had originally picked the hotel because of the reasonable price, and positive reviews but again and again we were disappointed. The first night we realized we could hear every sound outside of our door, and coincedentally they happened to be doing construction in the very next room. Electric drills, hammers, the works. We asked to change rooms but there was nothing available, but we were assured the construction would stop soon. Around 7PM it ended. We went to take a shower, and to our dismay there was NO hot water. Not only that the shower head was bursting bouts of dirt all over the bathtub. We were very disappointed at this point to the point of wanting to check out and when we expressed our concerns the plumber of the hotel came up to our room and started SCREAMING at my husband saying my husband did not know what hot water was (because there isn't a difference between freezing and warm in his mind apparently). We ended up staying at the hotel because we had already paid and were given attitude for the rest of our stay. Also, we found out that the hot water heater had broken the night before from the receptionist.

All seemed too expensive, too small, too noisy, had no shower pressure, uncomfortable beds or snotty staff. So, I took the advise of Trip Advisers reviewers and have finally found the most wonderful place to stay. Everything from the other reviews is correct. The location is great - in a quiet street with a small shop and dry cleaners around the corner. Around 10 minutes walk from the Metro station and safe at night to walk the streets. The Arch de Triumph is about 10-15 minutes walk away and the Eiffel Tower about 20-25. Great restaurants to suit all budgets are also close by. The staff are wonderful, speaking perfect English for those who need it and French for those who want to practice. They are most helpful and will assist in any way. We were in there for New Years Eve and tried a to book a few restaurants but all were full. When we asked for help, the staff had booked us the restaurant we wanted at the time we wanted within 5 minutes! The rooms are quite large by Paris standards (I sneaked a peek through the door of most while they were being cleaned!). We had a non smoking Deluxe room on the 4th floor, and for 20Euros more a night than the standard, it is well worth it with an additional separate sitting room allowing you to really spread out. The bed was firm, the shower had good pressure and the in-room bar fridge has room for your own drinks if you want. As the hotel is located in a residential area, our view was of an internal courtyard and the back of other apartments, which made it very quiet. The room heating via radiators was good and can be easily adjusted. There is also an additional fan heater if you need it but were never turned it on and were never cold. All windows open fully to let in fresh air if you want. Rooms also had a/c but in December it was far from needed. There is a lift to all floors so you don\u2019t have to take the stairs with your cases - one at a time though with bags coz its small. The breakfast is nice with cereal, breads, boiled eggs, fruit, juice and tea and coffee included for around 12 Euros. There is also an option for breakfast in your room for the same price. There is free internet though a computer in the lobby and the reception is 24/7. So, if you are looking for a Paris hotel with a price well under 200 Euros a night, I would highly recommend Residence Foch.

Since our other hotels were a completely different style I can't really say how this hotel compares with others similar to it, but I will try to explain the facts for my experience. First off, although there are three different metro/train options nearby, none are particularly close and after a long day of sightseeing (i.e. walking and standing in line) it would have been nicer to get back to the room a little quicker. The area is safe, quiet, and mostly residential, but does have some cafes and a small grocery market (which comes in handy if you don't want to spend a fortune on food) within easy walking distance. The Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees were within a mile or two of flat terrain walking so the location has some plusses and minuses. The hotel staff was very friendly and English was spoken by all. The room we had was tiny (#60) and was located next to the elevator so sleeping in much was difficult. The view was similar to the pictures shown, but the room was in need of some updating and/or basic touch-ups. Nothing horrible, but seemed easily fixable. The breakfast buffet was very refreshing, but should have come with the room based on my reservation and our credit card seems to suggest otherwise. Just check with the front desk before you assume your reservation with free breakfast is noted. All in all, not the best, but certainly not terrible. A solid price, but considering the streets of Paris are littered with boutique hotels, I think I would have rather spent a little more to be in a more central location with a slightly nicer standard of room for my boutique experience.", "Date": "January 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hoogland", "Title": "\u201cLovely little gem\u201d", "Author": "ArJaminyfe", "ReviewID": "UR12332907", "Content": "From 29 December 2007 until 1 January 2008 we stayed with our three teen-age daughters in this very homelike hotel.

The breakfast is being served on the groundfloor in a little cosy room with 12 chairs. The atmosphere there is very relaxing and informal and the staff will do everything to satisfy you and to feel comfortable. There are several sorts of fresh! bread, croissants, muesli, cheese, ham, marmelade, Nutella, honey, juices, fresh fruit, eggs, milk, yoghurt and much more.

They have this lovely habit of coming out in front of the desk to talk to you when you walk in the door. We had our 11 month old son with us and Nelly just loved him. We were given the only room on the top (7th floor). The room was nice. It was very clean but looked a little shabby in places(e.g. worn carpet).

We brought our computer with us and really appreciated the free wifi access. We had a big deep bath and it was lovely to soak in after a long day of walking around Paris. It is a 10 min walk to the L'arc de triomph and 20mins to Eiffel Tour. The area around the hotel is very quiet and feels very safe to walk in. The hotel booked a restaurant for us to eat at on Christmas night and it was spectacular! In fact there were lots of restaurants nearby and almost all looked really good. We ate breakfast in the hotel one morning and while it was nice, we felt it was completely overpriced at 12euro per person.

Before we did though, Nelly gave us an in depth brief about the transport system and the best ways to get about and how much things cost!! The map was free along with the advice and stood us in good stead for the 5 days we were there. On returning to our room, it was warm, comfortable and homely. The bathroom was clean with one hell of a power shower which was piping hot!! Our trip was made all the more enjoyable by the advice and recommendations given to us by Nelly and co. Local restaurants that we visited were great and not too expensive. And the evening meal cruise on the Bateaux Parisiens is a must!! We paid slightly more for the Select instead of the standard but I have to say that sitting anywhere would have been special enough. We did have a window seat towards the front of the boat that is the Premier area, but the food, entertainment and wine were all first class - simply pick your budget and you will have a fab time!! We did the usual tourist attractions, and were flabagasted by the queues for the Eiffel Tower during the day. We did however, return at 9pm that same night to find no queues so went straight up the lift to the top. Brilliant!!! Back to the hotel though! Nothing was too much trouble and we were always greeted with a smile and an inquiry as to where we were going, or where we had been, and given some beneficial advice which was extremely useful. If we had any complaints though, and I feel that word is too strong, I think feedback would be better, it would be that on a couple of occasions there was no where to sit at breakfast. Once again though, we would be reassured and not have to wait long for a table to be cleared and reset. Breakfasts were fantastic by the way!!! The final thing is that both of us came away with a couple of bites on arms and legs, which is strange as the hotel was really clean so c'est la vie!!! We really cannot fault the Residence Foch. The location is great, (25 min walk from the Eiffel Tower and 10 mins from the Arc de Triomphe!!) Loads of places to sit and eat/drink. Metro stations close by. We will definitely stay there again on our return to Paris. Last tip. \"Paris Shuttles\" taxi company were great. From the CDG Airport direct to the hotel door for 19 euros per person each way!!

After busy days, visiting museums, riding on Hop On Hop Off buses and eating in exquisite French restaurants, it was wonderful to arrive back to Residence Foch to rest and be restored for the next day. We all enjoyed the breakfast buffet. We also purchased cold meats from the local butcher, French cheeses from the Deli and delectable treats from the pastry shop which we ate in the foyer of Residence Foch.

The staff are friendly and eager to please when dealing with run of the mill queries but can be a little patronising and unwilling to help with more complicated requests. The location, whilst very quiet, is far from central. The nearest Metro station is a 20 minute walk and it's then a 15 minute ride to the centre of Paris. Whilst there's a restaurant next to the nearest Metro station, a dearth of any other decent bars, cafes or restaurants means not only do you have to travel some distance for the sights you must do the same for eats and drinks, too. (The hotel bar isn't inviting). We stayed in a superior room which was very comfortable and a good size with plenty of storage space. It was let down, however by the cramped layout of the ensuite bathroom. There was free wifi in the room (and thoughout the hotel). Breakfast was reasonable value (for Paris) at \u20ac12 each but the quality and variety was disappointing. There was a 'boil-your-own-egg' machine with no timer, the orange juice was from concentrate (not fresh) and the pastries were few in number, small and dry. Restaurant staff were very friendly, however. Leaving the hotel at 6:30 am on a Monday, the hotel were unwilling to serve us breakfast before we left, even in the room, which seemed to be a casualty of the place being a small, family run business.

We flew from Shannon to Paris with Ryanair and what was suppose to be 1h30min flight became 1h10min thanks to great flying conditions.

We were given our key and shown to the elevator as our room was on the 4th floor. Hotel itself is very small, with narrow staircase and tiny elevator, but myself and 6'3 husband and suitcase didn't have any problem to fit in:) As my husband told me that he got exellent price from hotel's web site I didn't expect much from it, but I was wrong again:)Yes, room is on the small side but it has everything you need and bathroom is quiet big. In the room there are huge windows so you can open them in the morning and smell fresh bread and croissants:), there is flat screen TV, air conditioner and ironing board and what I liked the most - room has Paris character, you know straight away that this room could be only in Paris and nowhere else in the world. In the morning we had breakfast in the dinning room downstairs, it is continental but we definitely didn't leave the room hungry:) What I liked the most about this hotel - it's location, it is close enough to all tourist sites, only 2 min walk to the Arc de Triomphe, but far enough to be able to blend in with locals and it is located in a very quiet district as well. Also there are alot of great restaurants near by, the best we tried was a sea food restaurant (sorry can't remember the name) at the end of rue de Malakoff, 2 min walk from hotel towards Port Maillot with a great price of \u20ac37 for 5 course set menu (including oysters and foie-gras!!!) Staying in this hotel gave us such a great energy every morning and high spirit to go out and enjoy every minute of our trip and coming back in the evening felt like coming home:) It's been nearly 3 weeks since we came back but myself and my husband still raving about it and I am sure all our friends are tired to listen about it :) and we plan to come back in a very near future. When visiting Paris again we will only stay in this hotel, unless we won a lotto and could afford to stay in George V, I would love to try it out:) My only advise to anyone visiting Paris - take it easy, start your exploring of the city by just sitting outside one of numerous cafes with a cup of coffee or a beer, breathing Paris air and absorbing this fantastic atmosphere around you, watching people passing by and loving every minute that you spend in this fabulous city.", "Date": "August 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "DublinDotty", "ReviewID": "UR8428287", "Content": "I stayed in Residence Foch for valentines day in Feb 07 - location was perfect, staff were great.

Our room (41) faced the courtyard and was adequate in size with a nice bathroom. Closet space is limited, but we don't pack huge amounts so it wasn't an issue. A few notes on the area. There is a small market called Shopi just a short distance away near the corner of Rue Pergolese and Avenue de Malakoff good for a bottle of water or wine and some snacks. A larger (very upscale) market can be found in the lower level of the Galerie Commerciale L'Atrium du Palais des Congres (just across from the Le Meridien hotel where the Air France bus stops). Very nice takeaway food. Even better is the market across from Bon Marche at the Sevres metro stop. We had dinner out at Le Petit Retro, a bistro recommended by Nelly, just off Place Victor Hugo; also at La Villa Corse, a Corsican restaurant on Avenue Malakoff (across from the Shopi market). We found both to be excellent; Villa Corse ended up being around 270 Euro for two, Le Petit Retro was half that. Porte Maillot metro station is large but less crowded than many and is also an RER stop. We found it easier to purchase our carnets (10 tickets for the metro) in the afternoon. The ticket windows were more crowded in the morning. For the Louvre, exit at the Palais Royal Musee du Louvre and follow the signs to the museum.

Certainly it is convenient for flights into, and out of, Beauvois airport, the airport bus transfer (13 euro single)making a one stop trip to Port Maillot which is about a 15 to 20 minute stroll to, or from, the hotel. The staff, Nellie et al, are all very welcoming and helpful to a fault. The hotel itself is located in a nice quiet residential street with a few embassies nearby and it's about a 15 minute stroll to Argentine metro which connects with just about anywhere you want to go. We arrived early so the room was not yet available and it was suggested we leave our baggage in the little reception area while we sauntered off for a while. This was also the case when we checked out at 12 noon with a whole day to kill before our flight home. While nothing happened to our baggage in the interim, I was, to say the least, most uncomfortable at having to leave it in such an exposed position where, frankly, just about anybody could have come in and wheeched it away. Something I had sussed from between the lines on Tripadvisor reviews was that the breakfast was not of particularily good value. I was spot on in this respect as at 12 euro per person (\u00a317 or $34 for two persons) it was the absolutely worst value I've ever seen in any European hotel (Riga to Rome via lots of places) for such a meagre offering. Nellie, despite what others may have said on this site, you are definitely not giving value for money as far as breakfast is concerned. We were fortunate in being allocated room 50 which had a small terrace attached so we we bought in all our breakfast provisions from local stores and boulangeries for a fraction of what we otherwise could have paid. Apart from that it was also more pleasant doing it al fresco than breakfasting downstairs in a small area off reception which had no ambience whatsoever. Regards the bedroom, yes it was small, so small that there was no designated area for luggage, only a small single wardrobe for hanging clothes, the hangers were of a design that immediately collapsed when you hung anything on them. Yes, Nellie was informed and produced some traditional style hangers but I doubt we were the first to experience this. The only other storage was two very shallow drawers in a small table supporting the TV suitable only for stashing knickers (either gender) and socks. I've given what I believe to be an honest review and if I was ever to return to Paris, which I won't, overrated and poor value, then I would certainly give this hotel consideration amongst many others. Incidentally, if you want to experience how vile food can be, yes in Paris, go to \"au sergent recruteur, rue st louis, i'lle st louis\" I can honestly say it was complete merde to give it the full local venacular. Or in Eurovision terms \"null point\". One last note of caution. I booked this hotel via Expedia falsely confident in the knowledge that, like every booking I'd previously made with Expedia, the cost was deducted from my credit card there and then. Not so ! On this occasion it transpired that my credit card was only being used to guarantee my arrival ! I was presented with the entire bill on my check-out. Not the fault of the hotel but it has put a fair dent in my faith re Expedia. If I hadn't a credit card with me I was in shtuck !

We thought staying in the 16th had its own pleasures anyway, and the hotel staff will direct you to local restaurants if you want to stay in the area for dinner.

Could only walk around the bed (twin beds immediately alongside one another looking like a large double). Certainly could not pass one another in the room had to wait for one another. Although ceiling is high the room felt claustrophobic. Could see from the plan of the other floors that on each floor there was a similar small room. The other rooms on each floor appeared, from the plans, to be much larger. However our beds were comfotable, the decor nice and the bathroom good with shower over a small bath, toilet, bidet and basin. The hotel was, by Paris standards, very nice and good value since we had 3 nights for the price of 2. It was a little disappointing that this related to accomodation only and breakfast on the 3rd day would cost 11euros each. However we took the opportunity to have breakfast in a nice cafe nearby. The area is very nice, walking distance of the Arc de Triomphe and at the end of the Metro line so good for getting around Paris. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance to avoid a metro journey late at night. We must have seen 30 - 40 restaurants in the nearby area. Top tip is go to the top of the Arc de Triomphe at night - wonderful views and there is a lift if you can't face the 200 plus steps.

Thanks to Isabelle for the tip on the restaurant nearby 'Bistro Saint Ferdinand'...33euro menu, 3 good courses inc good wine and coffee..try this one for sure..the Creme Brulee was amazing! The hotel stairways and stained glass windows on each floor are lovely...any other critisisms...well, minor ones...might have been nice if they had recognised my partners birthday as they knew it was a special occassion (the restaurant even managed to put a candle on his dessert and we only mentioned it in passing to a waiter !) getting ice was a a bit of a task...we couldnt have an ice bucket but was given a glass..but we had to bring it straight back and you are between two metro stations...take comfy shoes ! Other than that we would stay again... On Paris...take time out to have a beer or two at a pavement cafe and 'people watch'.. dont do the top floor of the Eiffel tower...massive q's up AND back down to 2nd floor and view not that much better..we did it thursday afternoon and we waited over 45 mins at the top! in fact 2nd floor is open and you get better pictures with Paris in the background...DO go back and see the tower at night! Do research on what you want to see at the Louvre and go EARLY...masses of tour groups make it a bit of a 'scrum' at times...there is SO much to see, trust us, make a plan before hand or you'll get fed up trying to find things! We bought the 5 euro headset tour...not worth it as so much not listed. NotreDame...amazing from outside...dingy and we felt a bit dissapointing inside...be brave and do the metro, get a 'Mobilis' ticket for the day (zone 1 & 2 under 6 euros).

Arrived very late at night as the flight was delayed. Found the hotel very easily. If you are using the Ryanair Beauvais flight the bus drops you 2 minutes away. Safe easy crossing of roads with kids as all had controlled pedestrian crossings. Night staff at hotel were first class. Just handed over the room keys and we were in. No complicated check-in, no fuss. Kids loved the tiny elevator to our family room on the 3rd floor. room was great, if a little dated. It was spotless, beds very comfy and bathroom was spotlessly clean, with bath and shower, loads of toiletries and mountains of soft white towels. Apart from the decor looking a wee bit twee, the room was perfect.This in no way should suggest that the room needed re-decorating however as it really was in first class condition. Interior of the hotel in general is very nice, no complaints at all. Very clean, fresh and well maintained and no lack of that French chic you're looking for. Overall, very stylish. Breakfast is served in the small dining room and staff on duty in the mornings were as friendly as you could get. None of the problems we were warned about for families arriving in France who speak very little French. Everyone at the hotel spoke perfect English and tolerated very well our pathetic attempts at speaking French. During our stay, it appeared that the guests were mainly Scottish and English, with a few French. This hotel really is as good as the reviews which led us to book it. The staff will happily recommend a local bar or restaurant and can advise you on everything from Metro times to the weather forecast. Kids did not find the hotel too formal or stuffy, in fact they were in love with the place from the start. The winding staircase to the rooms is classic French, adds charm to the hotel and is easier to manage if you have kids than the tiny elevator. Outside the Hotel you will find youself in a lovely narrow street, with tall buildings on either side with balconies bursting with colour from hanging baskets and window boxes full of red pelargoniums. Very nice and atmospheric. The Avenue de Malakoff is at the end of the street and there you have the Port Maillot Metro station which is your gateway to all of the sights in Paris. We were able to reach The Troccadero ( station nearest the Eiffel Tower) in a few minutes. The Metro is very safe and clean. It is constantly patrolled by Police and security staff but the feeling is far from oppressive, it's very relaxed. In fact the whole city centre feels the same way, safe and relaxed. No crowds of youngsters intimidating visitors here. Stepping out of the station onto the street, you turn a corner and the Eiffel Tower is there in front of you. You first view it from an elevated position and you will want to join the hundreds of others taking photo's. Take time to stand and stare. Spectacular. Forget those who say anything negative about this. It is stunning, especially at night when it is illuminated. Don't go at weekends during the day or you'll queue for hours. Of course you can take the stairs but how many kids want to walk up an open air staircase to the hieght of a high rise flat? Instead, try what we did. We got up early on Sunday morning and got to the tower for opening time at 9 AM. ( just a few stops on the Metro) We got straight onto the lifts, and enjoyed a much more leisurely trip, no crushing crowds to scare the kids. Level 2 was high enough for them and saved waiting on a lift to the top. Antther highly reccomended sightseeing trip is the Batobus (a riverboat/bus) which you get from the Eiffel Tower. Costs only a few Euro's and is well worth it.The journey is worth it by itself and is another chance to rest up without stopping. Glass covered, the boats are ideal in all weather. We were lucky with hot sunshine so the creww opened up the roof for ventilation. take a camera!!! There are other similar boats run by other companies but they are generally much larger and a bit pretentious. The Batobus is fine. You can hop on and off at any or all of the 8 stops on the Seinne. Given that these include Notre Dame and the Louvre you will want to get off and explore. Take time to sit in one of the many outdoor cafe's and have a drink or a spot of lunch. It will give you a chance to recharge you batteries.Our 2 loved the freshly made crepes with chocolate, messy but a lot of fun!! All of the cafe's we went to welcomed kids and without exception the French people were warm,friendly and helpful. Kids weren't bored at all as there was plenty going on for everyone. Street shows of music/dancing/ rollerblading etc kept them amused while we took in the sights. The kids were as sad to leave as we were. Back to the Hotel, for a shower and a change of clothes we relaxed in the small bar with a drink. Kids were welcome there too with none of the dissaproving frowns you can get from staff at some Hotels. Checkout is fast and efficient and you'll walk out of the door onto Rue Marbeau with a sigh, vowing to return soon. This place is that good. Are there better hotels,of course there are but the beauty of this place is that it has a value greater than can be measured by the wee ticked boxes of facilities. The whole experience of staying at this hotel is that you are an individual. Stay at the Hilton if you like and you'll be just another number.

Residence Foch, located a block from the Bois de Bologne, is the type of charming little hotel of a bygone era - the hotel is in a beautiful and wonderfully maintained old building and the rooms are homey, not ostentatious, with a personal feeling to them. I had requested a room on an upper floor facing the street and this is exactly what we got -- in addition our room (# 62) had a huge balcony with a little table and chairs and a view of the very top of the Eiffel Tower. The bathroom in our room was smaller than most (no bathtub), but it was worth the sacrafice to have the balcony. Breakfast, which came with our room rate, consisted of croissants, pain au chocate, rolls, fresh fruit salad, a choice of cheeses and meats, cereal, yogurt, juice, and tea or coffee. We brought our selection upstairs on a tray and ate out on the balcony, which was lovely. The rooms have air conditioning (essential in the summer!), safes, a mini-fridge, a hot water pot with tea and coffee makings, a small TV, slippers and hair dryers (no clock), and there is free internet access in the lobby. The bed was queen sized and very comfortable and the shower had excellent water pressure. The only down side of the room was that the floors squeaked a bit and the walls are a bit thin so you could hear a little noise from adjacent rooms. The staff was unparalled in terms of friendliness and helpfulness (and they do all speak excellent english) as previous reviews have touted - thank you to Nelly, Jean-Louis and Eddy for making us feel so at home. The location is quiet but within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower (where you can pick up a cruise on the Seine) and the Arc de Triomphe, close to the metro and the RER, and a few good restaurant and shopping streets close by. The buildings on the Rue Marbeau are beautiful and give you the feel of a real Paris neighborhood, albeit a fairly ritzy one. It is true that if you want to stay in the middle of all the action, this is not the place for you.
