We were on the 5th floor (of 6) and although our room was pretty small, we weren't really in it for very long and so didn't see this as a draw back. We had a double bed, with wardrobe space, shower room & separate wc. We overlooked the internal courtyard, so while we didn't get a street view, our room was peaceful & quiet. The small room with wc right off did mean that this was a cosy arrangement - and I can imagine that this could be embarassing if you don't know your room mate well! :-) The rooms all have Free WiFi which was one of the reasons I had selected this hotel - it was a great benefit and it was a great service. The hotel is beautifully decorated, the staff were all very friendly and would do whatever they could to assist. We borrowed the iPad from reception several times which was handy. The staff also helped us out with reservations at restaurants, they lent us a corkscrew & also lent us a Euro/UK charger as we had forgotten ours. We had breakfast at the hotel once. It was nice (croissant, juice, yogurt, bread) but we tended to go out & grab coffee/late breakfast once out and about. The hotel is in a great location, only a few minutes walk from Charles de Gaulle Etoile Metro/RER station on Ave Carnot. It is so close the L'Arc de Triomphe & the Champs Elysses and was a lovely area to walk around in. Lots of nice bars & restaurants nearby - and in fact, if we hadn't stayed at this hotel, we would never have found the next door restaurant \"Le Hide\" which was a fantastic place to eat. We were in Paris on a sightseeing break for 4 nights . I think this hotel was a perfect base for this type of holiday.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yerevan", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay!!!!\u201d", "Author": "LenaYerevan", "ReviewID": "UR125500715", "Content": "I would like to share our excellent opion of this hotel.

I can not gush about this hotel enough. Here is why. Location, Location, Location Balmoral is 5 minutes away on foot from the Arc de Triomphe, which means it is a mere few minutes more on foot from the Avenue des Champs-Elysees. The hotel is 2 minutes away from the drop-off point of the Air France Shuttle, which you can ride even if you are not an Air France passenger (for 15 euros). This means that you do not even need to ride a cab or bus from the airport to get here. The hotel is a few meters away from the metro station of Charles de Gaulle- Etoile. So it is very convenient to take the metro to and from the hotel. There is a small grocery, the Superette, right across the street. So you can stock up on water, nibbles, toiletries and batteries if you need to. Although just a short walk away from the grand avenues and landmarks, Balmoral itself is on a quiet road with cafes nearby if you want to cap the night off with coffee or wine. Amenities Hotel rooms in Europe will never be as roomy as those in Asia, but I was happy to find a quaint room with lots of character \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the toile drapes, fauteuils, and French balcony were enough to satisfy my Paris fantasies, hahaha. There is no grand view of the Parisian nightscape, but you do look out into the balconies and French doors of the hotels and buildings across. At 77 Euros per person per night, I will not complain! The bathroom is roomy, with modern fixtures. Our triple room had two lavatories (sinks), a small tub, and lots of space between the sink counter and toilet. I just have one comment though: for those taking showers, get ready to wet the floor. With the tub so low and tight, you have to aim the hand-held shower on your body, facing the wall, so that water splatters within the tub. The breakfast room and lobby have French appointments and d\u00c3\u00a9cor but on a moderate scale. So you have that Parisian experience that is formal yet intimate and inviting. WIFI is fast and free throughout the hotel. The lobby has one desktop for anyone to use. A breakfast tray is 11 Euros, but here is a tip: there is a bar with free stuff like cereal, muesli, butter and jam, strawberries and nutella, and fruit! I think you can get by on just ordering a cup of coffee. Hahaha. People We were taken care of very well by the staff. The two men at the reception, Christian and Victor, speak English very well and are very patient in explaining transport/commute options around and outside of Paris. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to, but Victor called our forwarding hotel to advice them of our arrival details, while Christian called cab companies to help us canvas the rates. When Victor saw that I was taking many shots of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interiors, he either took pity or was amused and was prompted to extend an offer, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Madame, would you like me to take photos for you so that you are actually in them?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hahaha. And of course, my friends and I will not forget Anthony, the Sri Lankan waiter who entertained us with stories of coming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the Philippines (his wife and children live in my home country) every few months AND helped us look for a Hertz car rental office a few blocks away when we got lost. He was already off the clock, but he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quit until he found the Hertz office for us. Price Balmoral is by no means the grandest hotel in Paris, but for all its conveniences and charm, this is surely great value for money. My group of five shared a double and triple room for four nights, which cost about 77 Euros per person per night. Compared to other Paris hotels, this is affordable so I was expecting a Holiday Inn experience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no frills and charm, just a clean bedroom and bathroom.

We had been in France for 2 weeks, first a week in Paris at the Marriott on the left bank, then a week in Normandy at a rented cottage. For our last night in Paris I wanted an older, charming hotel in a different part of Paris than we had previously seen. My husband and I disagreed about whether this review should be three or four stars. I said three, he said four, so I agreed to go with 4. The Balmoral is literally right around the corner from the Arc de Triomphe, in a busy part of Paris, with lots of shops, restaurants, incredibly good access to the Air France airport bus (a block away), and close to the Metro. It is on a quiet street but very close to cafes and bistros, and on a Saturday night the noise from around the corner went on until at least 3 a.m.. With no central air in the room we had to keep the French doors to the charming little balcony open, and therefore the noise kept me up half the night. The room was adequate in size, but hotel rooms in Europe are small, and this was no exception. There was a flat screen tv, in-room safe, adequate closet space, and a small fridge but no coffee or tea maker. The bathroom was roomy, very clean and well appointed with lots of fluffly white towels and two terry robes. Our bed was comfortable, but the carpet was old and dark and the furnishings were also older. There is a small bar off the lobby, which is also quite small. Mirrors give the illusion of some extra space. The elevator is tiny. My husband,and I and our two carry on bags filled it completely. So in the morning if you need to get somewhere quickly you had better take the stairs (a very charming stairway, however, up the center of the building). Bell hops were very helpful. The front desk clerk gave us the wrong info about the Air France bus. We were almost out of Euros and my husband asked about changing dollars so we could purchase the bus tickets. He told us that there was no problem, the bus driver would accept a credit card. That turned out to be wrong as we found out when our luggage was stored on the bus, which was about to pull away for the airport. Luckily by scrounging my husband and I were able to come up with the 30 Euros in cash that our fare cost. But it was a lot of needless tension. We did not have the continental breakfast in the hotel since we had to get to the airport so early. I would probably skip the 11 Euro in hotel breakfast and find a cafe close by....Would I stay at the Balmoral again ?Perhaps, but not in the summer during a heat wave, or on a Saturday night unless I wanted to party until the wee hours of the morning. It has its charms, but I value my sleep.My husband said he would definitely return even tho it is an older hotel with the drawbacks that entails.Then again, reasonably priced hotel rooms in a good location are not easy to come by in Paris, so perhaps I would reconsider.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201cUnusaul hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Michael S", "ReviewID": "UR118478114", "Content": "I was my pleasure to spend a week in this hotel.

I would recommend to sightseerers as you are placed right near the arc de triomphe and a 20 minute walk to the Eiffle Tower.

I emailed the hotel 2 weeks before we were due to arrive and asked for directions from CDG airport and requested a double room. I received a prompt reply confirming a double room and they gave us accurate directions from the RER station. When we arrived we were greeted by an english speaking receptionist (which all of the staff were) and we were quickly checked in and a friendly porter showed us to our room. We had a view of the road which wasn't anything special to look at but that didn't bother us as we weren't planning to stay in the room long. The room had a bathroom with a small bath and just a shower head attached to the taps which meant we could only really have baths. The bathroom was very clean and the towels were changed daily. There was a minibar which we didn't use, a safe and a trouser press. The bed was slightly uncomfortable but we still managed to have a good nights sleep each night. The room had plenty of mirrors and a few paintings, it had a light colour scheme which was okay but I feel it could do with modernising. My only problem with the Room was the amount of dust under the bed which was never cleaned up. I do feel however that if I had mentioned it to a member of staff it would have been cleaned as they were all helpful, I just didn't bother mentioning it as we spent little time in the room. The breakfast was included in our stay, it was a continental breakfast served in the bar downstairs. The room itself is very dim and not very refreshing in a morning. The breakfast was getting very repetitive and I wouldn't have paid the 11\u00e2\u201a\u00ac advertised had it not been included. Be wary when using the phone in the room, I made one phone call that lasted no more than 1 minute and was charged 1\u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 and it was only to a local restaurant.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFriendly Hotel in excellent position\u201d", "Author": "mojo020", "ReviewID": "UR86837056", "Content": "I don't ususally write reviews but having read a recent one from November about this hotel, I felt that I must.

I stayed with my husband at this hotel in October and thought that it was delightful. Our room was on the first floor which I had requested. It wasn't huge but it was comfortable, clean and perfectly adequate. The bathroom was very nice and may have been recently refurbished. The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful, booking taxis for us on a couple of occasions and the dinner cruise on the Seine. The lady booking us in on arrival welcomed us by name even before we introduced ourselves. This year we have stayed in hotels in Rome and Venice (both 4 star) and neither had hospitality trays. In fact I don't recall any hotels in Europe having them so feel it is unfair to be critical on that count. We felt that the breakfast was as good as any we've had in Europe. The position of the hotel was also very good, right near the action but still quiet.

Just returned from a family trip to this hotel, our second trip to the same hotel, but I think, our last! The hotel, despite having been taken over my a new owner in the course of the last year, has changed very little in terms of d\u00c3\u00a9cor, furnishings and service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in most circles that would be seen as a good time to update, refurbish and transform, but alas! The porter was the same one who had carried our luggage 6 years ago and he was as helpful and pleasant as before, a genuinely nice little man. During our stay we encountered 4 members of the reception staff at various times \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 3 men and 1woman. Both the men who we had on reception duty on different evenings were wonderfully helpful and pleasant, the gentleman on daytime reception duty was nothing more than business like which I guess, is what he is paid for, but the lady on reception duty gave the very clear impression that guests were nothing more than an irritation to her unless of course, it was 'check out' and 'take in' money time! This was certainly not the Amelie with whom I had corresponded at the time of my booking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she was delightfully helpful. We stayed in the 'family space' - rooms 37 & 38 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a double room and a twin, both with windows facing directly into nothingness and with no view save for solid walls a mere 3 metres away or other windows from other hotel rooms suffering the ignominy of a 'courtyard view' \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mmmmmmmmm delightful hardly springs to mind! Both the rooms had servicable, functional bathrooms (nothing more than though) but the toilets were beyond redemption in terms of space (see my picture) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to say that you could not 'swing a cat' in them does not really do justice to the 'compact' size \u00e2\u20ac\u201c suffice to say that if you are more than a 10 stone man or a size 10 lady then you would have real difficulty in doing either a number 1 or 2 in either washroom, I am an average size man, fit and flexible but I could not visit the toilet in my room without leaving the door open until I had removed my trousers and underwear, backing in, sitting down and ONLY THEN closing the door \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not much privacy it would have to be said unless your room-mate is blind or obligingly keeps eyes closed. The mini bar seemed adequate although we only used them for the purpose of keeping our water and chocolate biscuits (bought from the mini mart across the road from the hotel entrance) cool. Now quite why we bought biscuit belies sense really, as there is no hospitality kettle, cups on anything else in the rooms and not even available on request, you have to order a coffee or other beverage from the reception with the usual costs involved \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and there was me thinking that most European tourist industries recognised the need for a small hospitality tray in a guest room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c seems not FRANCE though \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unacceptable! The threadbare bedding in each of our rooms needed recycling not just 1 year ago but perhaps 5 would have been just about right. The carpets and floor covering throughout the hotel were starting to need replacing on our last trip, imagine our surprise to see that all was just the same \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it's a busy hotel on a very desirable location so where does the profit go \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it must be somewhere else rather than on the maintenance programme. On cost I would have to say that this is in no way value for money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c clearly there is no recession in Paris otherwise there would have been offers available in other hotels and this hotel would be forced to charge a tariff more commensurate with the facilities available 'in house' - this is NOT A CHEAP HOTEL. On a final note I would have to ask the question where does the owner of this hotel get the view the 11 Euros is either fair, eqitable or value for money for a breakfast when within 50 metres of the hotel and 50 metres of L'ARC de Triumph one can have the same for around 7 Euro \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one might be tempted to say, well that's the location, but we went to Versailles one morning and had a better breakfast within 50 metres of Le Chateau de Versailles (an arguably more impressive location) for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 5 euro 20 cents - now that is REAL VALUE for money!", "Date": "November 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Livorno, Italy", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location, comfort and kindness\u201d", "Author": "Gigiballa", "ReviewID": "UR86074457", "Content": "Nice and typical for Paris.

On my first night I was constantly kept awake by the staff banging around in the cleaning store and toilet, at 6 am in the morning the male cleaner was in full force, banging doors and clearing his obviously blocked sinuses. I noticed that the door could not be bolted from the inside and there was no do not disturb sign to put out, which meant anyone with a key could access the room at any time. I felt uneasy at this situation especially as the loo was directky opposite the door. Sure enough he knocked on my door and started to enter before I could get to the door to stop him. So the next three nights were sleepless and if I was in the bathroom I put my suitcase up against the door to stoo him entering. The reception staff are welcoming and very helpfull and the hotel is ideally situated. The breakfast was good, however on one morning I had the sinus clearing cleaner serve me.

We got to Versailles in 50 minutes, and got to the Gare de Lyon for a south bound train in twenty minutes. Breakfast was simple but fine; our room was very clean; the staff were helpful. But make sure you are realistic. Our room was small, almost devoid of natural light, and not a place to spend time in, and - although the web site may suggest otherwise - the reception and breakfasting areas are not places to sit and relax. This is a visitors' hotel and it is Paris: space is at a premium, and we were cramped. Paris is very busy and very expensive, and the Champs Elysees (and surrounding avenues) will charge you heavily for any sort of refreshment. There is a superb little restaurant (Le Hide) just three doors away from the hotel - great cooking and service, and not over expensive - but you'll need to book. With any restaurant in the locality, check out the prices and don't assume you'll be able to get a table on request. In consequence the cafes do good business and charge high prices too.
