While it\u2019s true the accommodations are more high end, the details are numerous and well thought out combining everything to make the most memorable part of Hotel32 the overall experience. From the warm greeting and limo ride from the airport to the use of my name numerous by the suite staff, simple touches made my 5 day stay in a strange city feel exclusive, yet familiar. My loft (38) at the end of the hall was one of the larger ones that overlooked the Vegas skyline with neon lights of Aria and the Crystals in the forefront. The room was well laid out and the modern yet understated furnishings were accessible for someone used to a cozy Seattle home. There were 3 flatscreen TVs, and a portable handheld touch screen device in the living room and bed room to control entertainment, lights, and drapes. While convenient enough to have the all this in one device, I did find using it to change channels on the TV less user friendly than a regular remote. French sliding doors open from the bedroom into the well-lit bathroom with a two sinks, a jet bathtub, and Kiehls toiletries. My favorite part of the room was the Opera shower, with an electronic wall mount controlling overhead colored lights and water flowing from the ceiling, showerhead, and sides. I fear I may never enjoy another regular shower again. I woke up on the Serta Presidential Pillow top mattress, feeling refreshed and like I had slept soundly through the night (which is rare for me in hotels). The staff (Joel and Ashley in particular) was friendly, helpful and accommodating without it feeling contrived and forced. They all seemed like they genuinely enjoyed their job. There is a small VIP lounge on the floor, with complimentary snacks at breakfast and before dinner. I especially liked the chorizo egg quiche in the morning. The red Hote32 key card also allows you a free locker in the Spa area, which is the access point to a well outfitted gym. While there were numerous machines, it did get crowded in the morning particularly for the cardio machines. After your workout, a cold pool, hot tub, steam and sauna room are accessible in the Spa. Unfortunately, the pool wasn\u2019t open, so I can\u2019t speak to it yet. Overall, I think Hotel32 offers you an exclusive high-class experience in a high to midrange casino/hotel in the heart of the strip. Its understated sophistication is accessible and doesn\u2019t feel at all manufactured in a city that makes its livelihood on being artificial.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cHotel 32 is fantastic\u201d", "Author": "exfedup", "ReviewID": "UR125140846", "Content": "Staying at Hotel 32 would not be the same without suite assistants Joel, Amber, Ashley, Parie & Sonya.

(My husband and I had a loft 3 nights and a studio connected to the loft for 2 nights of the trip for my uncle) First, my husband and I had an early morning flight and landed around 8:30. When our flight landed, our driver was right down the escalators waiting for us. I only mention this because some have noted that there has been an issue with transportation but I have not experienced that. Once we got to Monte Carlo, it was about 9ish and I was fully expecting to be told that a room wasn\u2019t ready and to return in a couple of hours. Early check in around noon is one thing, but to expect a room 6 hours before check-in is supposed to start is a different story. Having said that, to my surprise, they actually had a loft available, so I checked in at VIP and off I went up to the 32nd floor. Once we got up to Hotel32 we were greeted by one of the best suite assistants ever, Joel. He actually remembered me and my husband from our previous trip in August. That is am impressive memory! Our room was exactly how we remembered it, same quality and cleanliness upon the first scan so we just left our stuff in the room and went off to start the vacation. (Seriously, the rooms look exactly like what is pictured online, overall they\u2019re fantastic!) But a couple notes on the bathroom and technology situation with the loft suites- First-while the tub is absolutely splendid, it\u2019s mildly dangerous. It\u2019s extremely easy to slip while getting in and out. My husband slipped and hit his leg and still has a bruise a week later. I almost slipped one time but caught myself, it\u2019s just something to be aware of. Also, the morning we were checking out I went to take a shower and the screen was being super weird and changing temps constantly (ie going from 94 to 103 to 99 to 111 etc) My husband and I watched it for a couple minutes and it never settled on a temp. I tried changing the brightness of the lights to see if maybe it was just the control being weird, and the control wasn\u2019t changing the brightness either (it could do a color change but not affect the brightness.) Since we had to check out that morning I decided to just forget about it and get ready. I let Sonia, one of the suite assistants, know about the shower issue so it could be checked out before the next guests checked into the room, but not 10 minutes later engineering was knocking at the door to get it taken care of. In maybe 10 more minutes, she said it was fixed. All before we were ready to head out for the day. In regards to the technology in the rooms, the controls that are supposed to be wireless couldn\u2019t be removed from their stand for any longer than about 5 or 10 minutes, the batteries just were not holding charges. When they were docked they worked flawlessly, but just couldn\u2019t part with the charger. On the second day of our stay we also checked into a connecting studio because my uncle was joining us. This was the first time I had seen a studio and it was really nice! I personally think it was very roomy and I would not be hesitant to book a stay in a studio if for some reason I couldn\u2019t stay in a loft. We had the studio for 2 nights and my uncle had no complaints. There was an issue with the hold on my credit card for the studio (an extra night was on there and a discount I was receiving on the room had not been applied.) I spoke with Roy about it and everything got cleared up while I snacked on some tuna tartare hors d'oeuvres in the lounge. The issue was resolved in less than 5 minutes. Another minor issue was on the last night of our stay we could not get a hold of anyone to have some water brought to the room (we tried room service, guest service, and housekeeping and all the lines were busy) so my husband went down to the gift shop to buy some water but he couldn\u2019t charge it to the room even though I had filled out the paper allowing both him and my uncle to bill to both the loft and studio. It was nothing big, just a minor inconvenience which I mentioned to Sonia when I spoke with her about the shower issue. Sonia spoke with Nina the manager and they more than made up for both the shower and minor water inconvenience. Even though the trip had a couple very small bumps, the customer service throughout the stay was excellent and I still consider Hotel32 my home hotel in Vegas. What truly sets it apart is the customer service. Yes, for the same price as a studio you could stay at the elite luxury places on the strip but you\u2019re not going to get a limo to/from the airport, snacks in the morning and evening and the fantastic guest service that each suite assistant provides And in regards to the suite assistants, I just want to give a quick shout out to Joel, he was at the desk every morning to greet us and helped us set up anything we needed for that day.

We'd been staying at the Bellagio on previous visits, but ended up spending most of our slot playing time in the Monte Carlo, so decided we'd take a look at their rooms............and discovered Hotel32. Our flight was delayed and we were a little worried about the limo pick up. We needn't have been, He was there waiting to whisk us away to the hotel. We were greeted at the front door by Ed who took us straight up to Hotel32 and got us checked in. Our room was a Loft suite, and was lovely....far lovelier than an equivalently priced suite at Bellagio. A total of 4 televisions with a very snazzy remote control! The shower and bath were a revelation too, with the mood lighting and all the different settings. We found the provision of soft drinks and coffee in the lounge was a god send. We usually head off upon arriveal to buy soft drinks and milk, having brought a travel kettle with us, but no need as it was all there in the lounge. The suite assistants were very helpful. We'd phoned ahead to ask for show tickets, which had all been sorted out for us when we arrived. And on the one occasion that turn down hadn't happened, Roy sorted out a real chocolate treat for us to make up for the missing little chocolates usually left on the bed. When we were leaving, our limo was a few minutes late, and the staff couldn't have been more helpful, telephoning the limo company and staying with us until it arrived (10 minutes late).

Unlike the high rollers who stay in Vegas comped by the casinos, I\u2019ve only taken two comps during my stays. Rather than worry about how much I\u2019ll gamble, I research to find the best bargains possible and book as far as 7 months in advance. I stayed at Hotel32 in a Loft Suite 32-033 September 28 & 29, 2011 on a discounted rate found on twitter open to all called \"TeamPREZ Getaway\" which gave me 20% off the Loft Suite, 20% off at Brand, the Steakhouse, 20% Off Spa Service and 20% Off Minus5 (a specialty bar) Package. Having enjoyed my previous stays at the Monte Carlo in the past, I had done extensive research on Hotel32, the boutique hotel on the top floor. I\u2019ve stayed in Monte Carlo\u2019s Monaco, Spa and Diamond suites and was really looking forward to seeing what they did with Hotel32. Was I ever impressed. Two days before my arrival, I sent an email with my flight info and asked for an appointment to be set up at the salon for a haircut. I received a response from my \u201csuite assistant\u201d, Joel saying that everything was set. Sure enough, upon arrival at the airport, about 10:45AM, there was a limo driver with a Hotel32 sign. I only take carry-on with my on my Vegas trips and use the hotel laundry so there was no waiting for luggage. The driver took my carry-on and said \u201clet\u2019s get you home\u201d. This attitude of making me feel at home was everywhere. Since was alone, I only expected a Town Car. Nope, it was a stretch limo. Upon arrival at the Monte Carlo, I checked in at the VIP lounge and they actually had the suite ready. I immediately went up to check out the new digs for the next two nights. As you can see from the pictures, it is modern and oh so cool. Rather than go on and on about the room, I\u2019ll let the pictures do the talking and I\u2019ll just write about what I liked or didn\u2019t like\u2026 First, the suite is very high tech. Buttons for this and that, but nothing too complicated. Since I go to Vegas often, I\u2019m not in a rush and I do like to spend time in my room/suite as well as going out. This suite has four TVs (living area, dining area, bedroom and bathroom) and was the first suite that I was in that had a Blu-ray player. Since I didn\u2019t bring any with me, I didn\u2019t check it out. However, not only did the suite have the regular Monte Carlo cable, it also has the Direct TV satellite system. I don\u2019t know how many channels it is, but whatever D-TV has can be found here. This is a great amenity whether you are watching one of the many different sports channels, or even for family viewing. Next up is the coffee maker. I love my morning coffee and hate seeing anyone before I get my caffeine, and that includes room service. Well, this suite has a Jura coffee/espresso maker. The suite is stocked with fresh coffee beans and this machine grinds the beans just before brewing the coffee. I haven\u2019t seen this on the strip before. There is milk in the fridge, but they will also put half & half in it if you ask. While the bathroom has a Hydrotherapy soaking tub, I loved the shower, with its 8 different sprays of water, 4 from the ceiling, the regular shower head, and three more body sprays from the wall. All have the same force and quantity of spray. Ya, it has color and music settings, but just give me the \u201cbasic\u201d water sprays. Now I know what a car in an automatic car wash feels like. Clean everywhere! The bed was very comfortable what more do you need in a bedroom. I think there was a Blu-ray player there too, and yes this had Direct TV as well. One nice thing about the room was that the windows were clean and they could also be opened a few inches. I like fresh air and there aren\u2019t a lot of hotels with windows that actually open. Monte Carlo, Mirage on the lower floors and Tropicana all have the ability to open windows. Most of the hotels I\u2019ve stayed in have floor to ceiling glass windows so they will not open. Joel was my \u201cSuite Assistant\u201d. He did a great job as showing me around, picking up my laundry, making the appointment for my haircut (Rindy in the MC salon has cut my hair three times now and she always does a great job! Thanks Rindy you are the greatest), answering any questions, and making arrangements for my departure. He\u2019s been in the business for years and it shows. Thank you, Joel. There is also a special \u201cLounge 32\u201d on the floor which has minor morning (7 to 10 or 11) and evening (4 to 8?) finger foods as well as coffee, water and soft drinks all day long. My first night they had lobster puffs and the second night was some sort of Chinese bun with one a bit of sushi. In the morning, there was quiche and some salmon as well. These are finger foods and not meant to substitute as a meal although some think it does. Oscar does a terrific job at maintaining the lounge during the evening and he can get you whatever you might like. If you prefer spirits, they have that, but you will have to pay extra for it. One of the benefits of the \u201cTeam Prez\u201d deal was 20% off at Brand, Monte Carlo\u2019s steakhouse. I knew I wanted the tomahawk ribeye (tomahawk referring to the bone-in which is huge). It was good, a little steakhouse crispy on the outside in places, but rare, as ordered in the center. B+ for that, but the waiter, Brian, suggested the Brand salad and I went GaGa over it. It was so good. Green beans, tomato, shrimp and bacon pieces with some sort of vinaigrette that was not overwhelming. I\u2019m not a salad guy but bacon & shrimp could be staples in my home any day. Thanks Brian, that was my favorite part of the meal. When it was time to check out, I noticed $600+ in mini-bar charges from the previous guest were on my bill, but that was quickly rectified. Although the limo service is only to and from the airport, Joel did manage to get it for my next stop, the Mirage. Thanks again Joel. With all the good things I\u2018ve had to say, I want to make it clear that I stayed in the Loft Suite. The regular suite and the Studio do not have the same shower, but only a regular shower. And, due to the limited space, they do not have bathtubs either. This is clearly visible to all on their website as is the fact that the limo they provide is supposed to be to and from the airport. Hotel32 made good on every promise made to me, and I really do not have anything negative to say. That said, I have no hesitation giving my recommendation for a stay at Hotel32 in a loft suite. As with any stay in any hotel, call if you have questions to avoid any confusion. Do your homework and you will not be disappointed. Hotel32 is one of the best kept secrets in Las Vegas.

You need to sign out the mobile concierge, it is not given to you when you check-in, nor does the staff mention or ask you if you would like one. Lounge32 is only open from 7 am to 11 pm. Nowhere on the website does it mention this. Breakfast is mainly finger food, pastries, and some kind of fruit. The only \"snacks\" that we saw for the 2 days we were there were a bowel of apples. Appetizers are served starting at 4 and there is not much to choose from. Our room was small! Our refrigerator was never stocked with anything, not even water! The biggest con is the false impression of luxury that the website gives you as we did not experience anything that was advertised! Overall, I would recommend you spend your money elsewhere.

Bath amenities given are what you would receive at the regular Monte Carlo hotel. Water was free but was just your small little bottles with a HOTEL32 label on it to replace the MC label that you would get on the casino floor. You also get unlimited amount of free small bottles of Pepsi or Sierra Mist. As mentioned before, I stayed in a SUITE. Other reviewer on here has pictures of either a Loft of Penthouse which looks really good. I will give a review on the suite. This suite was IMO, worse than others that in the price range if I had actually paid for it. The bed was pretty comfortable and the bathroom had dual sinks. There was only one TV in the room but get this, there was NO bath tub in this suite. IMO, this is unheard of. No bath tub in what is suppose to be a higher end Vegas hotel? Wow. There was also no ironing board or iron to be found in the room. I am pretty sure I could have asked for one but shouldn't it come standard in the room like all the other rooms in Vegas?

Now that the trip is over, I am SO GLAD we went with Hotel 32! When we arrived, the driver provided by the hotel was waiting for us and even knew which baggage carousel our bags were on and gathered them for us. There were chilled bottles of Voss waiting for us when we got in the limo and the ride to the hotel was very pleasant. Once we arrive at the property, a bellhop got our luggage and escorted us up the the 32nd floor (Skipping the CRAZY check in lines at the front desk was great!). One of the suite assistants, Joel (who was just fantastic and extremely helpful throughout our whole stay) checked us in and showed us our room, explaining how everything worked (We were in a Loft suite, which has a ton of tech in it such as the various controls for the shower's water and light settings). The room was absolutely fantastic and matched exactly what the website showed online (which is hard to say for many hotels). There was a small issue with the bluetooth connection which the AV guys couldn't quite figure out, but they provided us with a cable which worked just fine to connect our mp3 players to the system, so no real issue there. Part of staying at Hotel 32 means you have access to the lounge which has great snacks in the morning and evening. For example, there were mini-eggs benedict and yogurt parfaits in the morning and veal meatballs and lobster puffs in the afternoon. My husband and I also did a pool day at MC (but the suite assistants can hook guests up with reservations at any MLife property pool). We rented a daybed, which was excellent. Dawn and Michelle were absolutely fantastic servers, keeping us well supplied in daiquiris and snacks throughout the day. We seriously never had an empty glass all day! Of course, the rest of the Monte Carlo property isn't as mind blowing as Hotel32, but the tram to Aria/City Center/Bellagio is a great option to play at higher end properties So, key final thoughts- Hotel 32's accommodations (loft suites) are FANTASTIC Joel was an excellent suite assistant willing to go above and beyond for guests If you're gonna spend time at the pool, go for a daybed and ask for Dawn or Michelle (Although I'm sure they aren't the only great servers!). I've grown up going to Las Vegas, have logged well over 30 trips, and have stayed at almost every property on the strip (and a few off strip) and Hotel 32 is officially my favorite and I think my husband and I will be making it our home-base for any foreseeable trips to come; we're already planning on booking for December (I say this after one trip to MC 5 yrs ago or so, having vowed to never step foot on the property again)! And as a side note, overall I think that MC is making strides in the right direction. We went to happy hour at The Pub and the food and service there was fantastic too, and Brand's after hours was...epic, to say the least.

Our room was spacious with good views, great bathroom accessories and during our 4 night stay, well serviced each day. The Happy Hour was a way to meet other guests with beautifully presented finger food - not a huge choice, but just perfect for a snack before dinner. Helpful waiters and waitresses, with tips of what to see and where to go. Breakfast was served in the same area - like other reviews there was only one hot dish to select from, but plenty of fresh fruit and other cold selections. Enough to get you started for the day. Also open all day for tea, coffee, soft drinks and bottle water. We were in Vegas to see the sights and experience the diversity of all the hotels in the area. We spent little time at the Monte Carlo itself, returning for a nightcap in the evenings. We did eat at a buffet there - average and at the Chinese Noodle House, where the meal was quite acceptable. The service desk staff on the floor was most helpful, contacting tour agencies that we had already booked from Australia for us. Always pleasant and welcoming when we returned after a long day of sight seeing. We did have a problem one night with excessive noise from the room next door, which was addressed by the hotel staff fairly quickly. We also had a problem with an early morning call that did not come on the day we needed to get to the airport and the limo service did not appear either.

However, I have a few gripes that many should be aware of: - ELEVATORS: the much-vaunted special elevators don't really exist!! They painted 2 of the 6 elevators in that area red, but you can't call them, even with your room card. They just show up randomly, and ANYONE can get on them and go to ANY floor. If you're on the 32nd floor, trying to get down to the casino level, you can imagine what a pain it is when it gets stopped at every other floor to let on another batch of slow slack-jawed tourists. NOT FUN, NOT AS PROMISED - The Lounge is just an empty space: It's pretty much unattended during the day and breakfasts were sparse and unimaginative. You'd see the exact same hard hotel pastries every day, and have only one hot option (eggs benedict 2 days in a row??). Want juice? You'd have to chase down the elusive attendant for that. At least twice I tried to get coffee or hot water, only to find out the dispenser was empty. - Monte Carlo Infrastructure: This may be a refined and elegant floor, but it' still on top of a mediocre quality casino hotel. Dining options were limited to a food-court and some bad, no-name restaurants. Air quality was poor, as well. We had to stuff kleenex in the holes in the door jambs to keep smoke from other rooms and/or the casino from pouring in - Loud, Loud Pool Music: the pool scene blared pumping club music that was inescapable even at 32 floors above. This wouldn't be so bad, except they started at 9:00 AM. Really?? - Small Details Forgotten: Maid service was spotty, sometimes forgetting little details like emptying the garbage. Also, one lamp and the electrical outlet at our desk area didn't work. You'd think with only one floor to keep track of, they'd do a better job at maintenance. While it's no Four Seasons, I'd put it at the level of a Wynn Resort room-wise but the main common areas are more like a Marriott. The extra attention and complimentary limo service make it a nice option.

And I'm very glad we did. First off, the ride from the airport was key! Just us, no others - quick out of there and the limo is fun. We were greeted by name at the front door of the hotel and were very quickly on our way to the 32nd floor. Check-in was a breeze - sign and go. The room had a small tray of berries, perfect little snack after the long day we had. We were in one of the small rooms (lofts?) and it was fine for us (although after reading the previous review I would have at least liked to have peeked in one of the larger rooms:) we did plan on spending a lot of down time as we hadn't had a day off since October! It was perfect for us. While there we needed a large document printed and faxed - we were willing to go to and do it ourselves but Hotel32 was more then nice about doing it for us (OMG, I forgot his name....Joel? J name and worked the morning shift - soooo sorry!! I'll call him Joel - ) Joel was so nice and didn't hesitate to do it for us. \"Thank you again!!! So sorry if I got your name wrong!\" And listening to him speak to other guests - he's a gem to the hotel. We did have one problem, and I in no way shape or form blame the hotel. Bad neighbors. I mean, obnoxious! I travel a lot, I've had noisy neighbors, but these guys were beyond that. Even punching holes in the hallway around 3am. They were in the room behind our bed and sounded like they were throwing each other against the wall making my head pop up (group of guys) and hollering to no end. I can't even explain here how bad it was. Sona was very nice about moving us. (And thank you so much for the wine!! I wanted to thank you in person but missed you) We did hate to complain, but, it was that bad - over 24hrs of yelling and thumps against the wall. I ordered room service once - very prompt and polite. Room was very clean and I spent a lot of time on the nice chaise lounge by the window. Definitely a good value.

The gaming of the Monte Carlo is really sub par.

I will not go into detail repeating what others have said in recent reviews but, like others, we were greeted at the airport by our limo driver and taken to the front entrance of the Monte Carlo where a bellman was waiting to take our bags and escort us up to the Hotel32 lobby. We were then greeted by a suite assistant who gave us a brief tour of the lounge and offered us a drink before taking us to our Loft suite and giving us a tour and checking us in on the spot. The Lofts are quite spacious, about 1200 square feet with a separate living / dining area and bedroom, which is great if, like us, you tend to be night-owls in Vegas and spend some downtime in the room during the day. Having the in-room coffee / expresso / cappucino machine was wonderful for when we rolled out of bed in the morning. And the 8-head, chromotherapy shower was a nice, luxurious touch (never mind that it was large enough to easily accommodate four people - should you ever find a need to simultaneously shower with three other individuals while in Vegas) as was the large, jetted soaker tub. The in-mirror TV was a cute detail. The king-sized bed was extremely comfortable as well and, along with the fact that we never once heard any noise from the hallway or another room, resulted in some of the best nights' sleep I've ever had in a room in Vegas before. Everything in the room worked perfectly and the twice-per-day maid service never missed a thing. The only (very minor) complaint about the room was that, in a room of this size, there was very little closet space (one small closet in the bedroom to the left of the TV) - but that is a very minor detail. The lounge was a nice bonus. We did not generally partake of the small hors d' oeuvres for the most part (although the few we did try were quite tasty), but it was great being able to grab a bottle of water or soda on our way out or when returning to our room. However, it was the personalized service, from pre-check in through check-out, that truly sets this property apart from others on the strip, and will likely bring us back on our next trip. When I was called the week prior for our flight information, they asked if we had any special requests for stocking the mini-bar. We asked for a few small items (including a bottle of Bacardi 8) and found them waiting for us in the room when we arrived. The suite assistants were continually gracious and accommodating throughout our stay. It truly was a matter of, \"if you ask for it, we will take care of it.\" In fact, we even recieved a few items that we did not ask for. Although we booked our room a few months prior, my girlfriend and I deceided about 2 weeks before the trip that we were going to elope while in Vegas. This was mentioned to the suite assistant checking us in only through an offhand remark when she asked if my girlfriend shared the same last name as myself; I responded that, \"it will be in two days.\" The day before our wedding, every suite assistant that we came into contact with stopped us to wish us luck (including those we had not previously spoken with). And upon return from our wedding activities on Friday afternoon, we were plesantly surprised to find some candles, bath salts, chocolate covered strawberries and a chilled bottle of champagne waiting for us in our suite - a small gift from the staff, which we thought was a very sweet gesture on their part. Overall, our experience at Hotel32 was simply perfect, and we will likely abondon our practice of staying at a different property each time we come to Vegas and return here instead on future visits (I did say this once before after staying at TheHotel for the first time a few years ago, but this time I truly think that this decision will stick).", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!!\u201d", "Author": "KJJackson", "ReviewID": "UR83784870", "Content": "Our stay started with limo pick up from the airport.

I stayed in a studio room which seemed to be very small and nothing more than a regular hotel room. The bed was comfortable and the tv was nice but those things are pretty standard now days. There was no tub only a narrow shower and the lighting in the bathroom was way too dim and there was no where to put anything it seemed. When we came back into the room the first night we found it to whistle and the only way to make it stop was to crack open the window but then you could hear the traffic but it was not as annoying as the whistling sound. Also the curtains did not fully close, thankfully a hair clip did the trick. The cool things were the limo transfer to and from the airport, robes and slippers, free voss waters, the small and weird fruit welcome amenity, and free sodas in the little lounge. Most of the staff on the 32nd floor seemed to be nice except for a grouchy man in the lounge one morning and I didn't get his name but if one is going to be serving guests of VIP status they should at least pretend to like their job and make the guests feel welcome. There was an issue with the Cafe at the Monte Carlo, service was below standards and as was the food, we were seated at a filthy dusty table and when asking the server to wipe off the table she reluctantly wiped off only the part in front of the person with me and didn't even do my side. The food was not bad but it wasn't really good either. The pub had great service and much better food, except for one bartender who was kind of a jerk one nght. If you want good guacamole go to Diablo's it was the best however the rest of their food seemed mediocre and overpriced. The resort fee was waived thankfully because although it includes use of the spa and fitness facilities, the spa was to say the least, pitiful. The jacuzzi was not warm and there are no jets and it smelled really bad of chlorine. The pool area at the Monte Carlo is overrun with small children and really bad loud music and some area's kind of smell like sewer. As far as the casino goes, I found it to just suck up my money and none of the machines would even play with me. I enjoyed playing at the Aria on 20.00 for over 5.5 hours where the cocktail waitresses were friendly and they were always coming by before I even had time to finish my drink from the last time they came by, it was by far the best casino experience. Now I would stay here again for free because who doesn't like free, but if I had a choice to stay at Bellagio or aria I would stay there instead. I have stayed at the Bellgio many times and their standard room is nicer than the studio at Hotel 32.", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampton Bays, New York", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Vacation\u201d", "Author": "Debbiloft69", "ReviewID": "UR77759154", "Content": "This was my second time staying in a loft at Hotel 32.One of the best features was Lisa in the VIP Services.She could not have been more helpful in taking the time arranging places for us to go and directing some of my friends who were first timers in Vegas places to see.we definitely were treated like VIP the whole stay upstairs and downstairs.the only thing that was disappointing with the second trip was no snacks like nuts and chex mix throughout the day in the shot glasses upstairs.But thanks to Lisa we had a wonderful stay and cant wait to go back in Feb.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cLots of extras\u201d", "Author": "mindme", "ReviewID": "UR71807291", "Content": "With the down economy, rooms in Vegas are going for some pretty attractive rates. But they get you with food and beverages. Hotel32 presents a compelling package: luxury, VIP treatment, and free food/beverages but at a price point you're accustomed to paying for a standard room in almost any major North American city outside of Vegas. The studio rooms at Hotel32 provide the best value. Pickup/drop off at the airport in a real Bellagio limo (not a town car). You're whisked to the VIP check in. There's free soft drinks and food in the club room throughout the day. And you're taken care of nicely by a \"butler\" dedicated to your floor. Nod to Hotel32's Joel (I think he works monday - friday) who really bends over backwards for a floor guest. The limo pickup/drop off is a very nice feature. A limo driver greets you at baggage pickup in the airport with your name on a card. He hauls your bags off of the belt for you and escorts you away. Everyone in baggage claim is wondering who the big shot it. Your drop off to the airport is booked to your schedule. No having to frog march yourself onto a crowded shuttle van that comes once an hour. The breakfast in the club room was a great way to start your day. The free bottled Voss water was great to take with you while you're out and about. Dinner time there's a light meal served in the club room and free coffee and wine down in the VIP lounge. The location is pretty good too. You're on a free tram line that runs north and gets you in air conditioned comfort to City Center, Bellagio, and Caesar's Palace. You're a short walk to New York New and then Excalibur and its tram line to Mandalay bay.", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Biddeford, ME", "Title": "\u201cGreat room and great value\u201d", "Author": "Sir_Topham_hatt", "ReviewID": "UR70516256", "Content": "We were traveling with our 16 year old son and wanted to treat him to something nice. The check-in person offered me an upgrade to a Hotel 32 \"LOFT\" for $120/night more than the cost of the room we reserved. It was a 1200 square foot suite so I decided to splurge and upgrade. What a great decision! The room is the size of 3 of their standard hotel rooms. The loft had double doors in the entryway and when you walked in, there was a beautiful living area that was the size of 2 hotel rooms. It had a large wrap-around sofa, lots of small seating and a high dining table with plenty of seating. The bedroom had a California king and was super comfy. The bathroom was wonderful - double frosted glass doors on sliders to enter. 2 sinks, one on each side. Toilet area was enclosed in frameless frosted glass, affording plenty of privacy. There was a huge deep soaking tub with an overflow trough so you could fill it to the top. The shower was 4' x 6' with a marble seating bench. There were 8 shower heads in the frameless glass shower - YES - 8! 4 in the ceiling and 4 on the wall. You could program the shower to simulate a thunder storm, a sunrise, calm waters, etc, all with lighting. It was easy to operate, too. The mirror above one of the sinks had a TV behind the mirror so you could watch TV while using the bathroom - nice touch. And, speaking of TV's, there were 3 other large (maybe 52\"?) flat screens in the suite - 1 in the bedroom, 1 in the living room and 1 in the dining area. If all this wasn't enough, the coolest part was the wireless \"Crestron\" - there were 2 of them. From either one, you could remotely open the sheers, the drapes, turn on/off all the lights, TV, volume, air conditioning, etc. That was so much fun to use. I had only 1 complaint. We stayed there 6 nights (so we weren't just a one night guest) and when I got home, I checked out Hotel32 on their website and learned we were supposed to get free airport limo pick up and drop off. When I first checked-in, I was clear that I was waiting for my husband and son to arrive from the airport in a few hours. The host even suggest I wait in the Hotel32 lounge for them to arrive. No mention that they could send a complimentary limo to pick them up and I didn't know to ask because I didn't know we were staying there until check-in. When we checked out, we checked out with the suite assistant on the 32nd floor. Again, it was obvious we were heading to the airport and no offer of a free ride in a limo to the airport. If you include something in a room rate, you should offer it and ask the guests if they need the service, especially to a guest that stayed with you 6 nights - It was supposed to be included in the cost of our stay. I mentioned this to MC on their Facebook page and in an email survey, and so far, no response which is surprising because the service and friendliness of their staff while we were there was wonderful. Aside from the limo disappointment, I would give Hotel32 an A+ and would stay there again (requesting a limo, of course). If you are looking for a real treat for your next trip to Vegas, Hotel32 is a great choice. Stay in a loft.

I stayed in a 2 bedroom penthouse at hotel 32 and even though it was nice it was average. The cost was $1200 per night. The skylofts run from $600 --$1250 per night for a 2 floor 2 bedroom penthouse. The only thing that was better in this room over the other penthouses were the bathrooms. They could of used a better TV in the bathrooms but that aside they were nice. Hotel 32 prides themselves on saying they are a sister to the Skylofts. Well in this comparrison the Skyloft is a bikini model and Hotel 32 is the pretty girl next door that just has that 1 weird thing about her that you just can't really put your finger on LOL. I would visit again if the room was more like $400-$500 per. No extras like free beverages or snacks in your room. They do offer some free treats all day down the hall. I didn't find anything in there I was crazy about but they do go the extra mile in there for you. Very nice people. They cater to you but don't crowd you like the skylofts. One thing I disliked and find trashy is the bathroom is all glass even the entrance door to the bathroom. I don't and I repeat don't want to see someone going to the bathroom. The bathroom should have a wooden door. It's like this in a regular suite also I was told. No women is that pretty to be seen using a bathroom.......now add 15 years of marriage to that and it gets sadder LOL. Didn't use the pool. They have a floating river and wave pool but its very small. Mandalay bay has the same type of pool area but the wave and river pools are much much larger then Monte carlo (hotel 32). The casino was fun but very low maximum bets. $50 on 3 card poker and Let it ride. The tables had low minimun bets though $5 and $10. The slots were very loose. One other thing. The web site makes the penthouses seem better then they really are. They are nice but at a reasonable rate.

My stay was comped but these rooms normally go for $600 a night. All 4 nights of my stay were quiet and comfortable. If you book a room at Hotel 32, they will send a limo to pick you up from the airport and take you to the main Monte Carlo entrance. There a suite assistant will greet you and escort you to the 32nd floor to check in. There is almost never any line up at the hotel 32 front desk. The assistants will take you for a tour of your room and teach you how to use the LCD control box to turn on the TV's, lights and drapes. Even the shower is electronic! I was impressed. The bed was extra comfy. The Monte Carlo itself is a very quiet casino compared to the others on the strip. In the evenings, other hotels would be full of people gambling, walking around, drinking, etc. The Monte Carlo just didn't compare, especially in the category of having beautiful people around. Sigh. The gambling for this trip was fantastic for me and I was able to leave Las Vegas as a winner. Drink service at the tables were average and the dealers on the most part were friendly and wanted you to win. I ate at the 24 hour Cafe and the Pub once and the food was above average. Didn't try the buffet but I've had it before in prior trips and it was ok. I saw Terry Fator and Love this trip and I liked Terry Fator the best. Love was kind of boring for me but I'm not old enough to appreciate the Beatles. Overall my stay at Hotel 32 was great. My room, food and beverage was all comped.
